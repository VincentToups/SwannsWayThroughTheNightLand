this to be love that your spirit to live in a natural holiness with the beloved and your bodies to be a sweet and natural delight that shall be never lost of a lovely mystery and shame to be unborn and all things to go wholesome and proper out of an utter greatness of understanding and the man to be an hero and a child before the woman and the woman to be an holy light of the spirit and an utter companion and in the same time a glad possession unto the man and this doth be human love for this to be the especial glory of love that it doth make unto all sweetness and greatness and doth be a fire burning all littleness so that did all in this world to have met the beloved then did wantonness be dead and there to grow gladness and charity dancing in the years i mirdath the beautiful and i cannot touch her face and i cannot touch her hair and i kneel to empty shadows just memories of her grace and her voice sings in the winds and in the sobs of dawn and among the flowers at night and from the brooks at sunrise and from the sea at sunset and i answer with vain callings it was the joy of the sunset that brought us to speech i was gone a long way from my house walking lonely wise and stopping often that i view the piling upward of the battlements of evening and to feel the dear and strange gathering of the dusk come over all the world about me the last time that i paused i was truly lost in a solemn joy of the glory of the coming night and maybe i laughed a little in my throat standing there alone in the midst of the dusk upon the world and lo my content was answered out of the trees that bounded the country road upon my right and it was so as that some one had said and thou also in glad understanding that i laughed again a little in my throat as though i had only a half believing that any true human did answer my laugh but rather some sweet delusion or spirit that was tuned to my mood but she spoke and called me by my name and when i had gone to the side of the road that i should see her somewhat and discover whether i knew her i saw that she was surely that lady who for her beauty was known through all of that sweet county of kent as lady mirdath the beautiful and a near neighbour to me for the estates of her guardian abounded upon mine yet until that time i had never met her for i had been so oft and long abroad and so much given to my studies and my exercises when at home that i had no further knowledge of her than rumour gave to me odd time and for the rest i was well content for as i have given hint my books held me and likewise my exercises for i was always an athlete and never met the man so quick or so strong as i did be save in some fiction of a tale or in the mouth of a boaster now i stood instantly with my hat in my hand and answered her gentle bantering so well as i might the while that i peered intent and wondering at her through the gloom for truly rumour had told no tale to equal the beauty of this strange maid who now stood jesting with so sweet a spirit and claiming kinship of cousinhood with me as was truth now that i did wake to think and truly she made no ado but named me frank by my lad's name and gave laughter and right to me to name her mirdath and nothing less or more at that time and she bid me then to come up through the hedge and make use of a gap that was her own especial secret as she confessed when she took odd leave with her maid to some country frolic drest as village maids but not to deceive many as i dare believe and i came up through the gap in the hedge and stood beside her and tall she had seemed to me when i looked up at her and tall she was in truth but indeed i was a great head taller and she invited me then to walk with her to the house that i meet her guardian and give word to my sorrow that i had so long neglected to make call upon them and truly her eyes to shine with mischief and delight as she named me so for my amissness but indeed she grew sober in a moment and she set up her finger to me to hush as that she heard somewhat in the wood that lay all the way upon our right and indeed something i heard too for there was surely a rustling of the leaves and anon a dead twig crackt with a sound clear and sharp in the stillness and immediately there came three men running out of the wood at me and i called to them sharply to keep off or beware of harm and i put the maid to my back with my left hand and had my oak staff ready for my use but the three men gave out no word of reply but ran in at me and i saw somewhat of the gleam of knives and at that i moved very glad and brisk to the attack and behind me there went shrill and sweet the call of a silver whistle for the maid was whistling for her dogs and maybe the call was also a signal to the men servants of her house yet truly there was no use in help that was yet to come for the need did be then and instant and i nowise loath to use my strength before my sweet cousin and i stepped forward briskly as i have told and the end of my staff i drove into the body of the left ward man so that he dropped like a dead man and i hit very sharply at the head of another and surely crackt it for him for he made instantly upon the earth but the third man i met with my fist and neither had he any great need of a second blow but went instant to join his companions and the fight thus to have ended before it was even proper begun and i laughing a little with a proper pride to know the bewilderment that i perceived in the way that the lady mirdath my cousin stood and regarded me through the dusk of the hushed even but indeed there was no time left to us before there came bounding up three great boar hounds that had been loosed to her whistle and she had some ado to keep the brutes off me and i then to beat them off the men upon the earth lest they maul them as they lay and directly there was a noise of men shouting and the light of lanthorns in the night and the footmen of the house to come running with lanthorns and cudgels and knew not whether to deal with me or not in the first moment even as the dogs but when they saw the men upon the ground and learned my name and saw me proper they kept well their distance and had no lack of respect but indeed my sweet cousin to have the most of any only that she showed no intent to keep distance of me but to have a new and deeper feeling of kinship than she at first had shown and the men servants asked what should be done with the foot pads seeing that they were now recovering but indeed i left the matter along with some silver to the servants and very sound justice they dealt out to the men for i heard their cries a good while after we had gone away now when we were come up to the hall my cousin must take me in to her guardian sir alfred jarles an old man and venerable that i knew a little in passing and because our estates abounded and she praised me to my face yet quaintly wise and the old man her guardian thanked me most honourably and with a nice courtesy so that i was a welcome house friend from that time onward and i stayed all that evening and dined and afterward went out again into the home grounds with the lady mirdath and she more friendly to me than ever any woman had been and seemed to me as that she had known me always and truly i had the same feeling in my heart towards her for it was somehow as though we knew each the way and turn of the other and had a constant delight to find this thing and that thing to be in common but no surprise save that so pleasant a truth had so natural a discovery and one thing there was that i perceived held the lady mirdath all that dear fore night and this was indeed the way that i had my pleasure so easy with the three foot pads and she asked me plainly whether i was not truly very strong and when i laughed with young and natural pride she caught my arm suddenly to discover for herself how strong i might be and surely she loosed it even the more sudden and with a little gasping of astonishment because it was so great and hard and afterward she walked by me very silent and seeming thoughtful but she went never any great way off from me and truly if the lady mirdath had a strange pleasure in my strength i had likewise a constant wonder and marvel in her beauty that had shown but the more lovely in the candle light at dinner
