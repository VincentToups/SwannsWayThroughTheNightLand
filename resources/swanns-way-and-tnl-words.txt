volume one by marcel proust translated from the french by c k scott moncrieff new york henry holt and company 1922 contents overture combray swann in love place names the name overture for a long time i used to go to bed early sometimes when i had put out my candle my eyes would close so quickly that i had not even time to say i'm going to sleep and half an hour later the thought that it was time to go to sleep would awaken me i would try to put away the book which i imagined was still in my hands and to blow out the light i had been thinking all the time while i was asleep of what i had just been reading but my thoughts had run into a channel of their own until i myself seemed actually to have become the subject of my book a church a quartet the rivalry between françois i and charles v this impression would persist for some moments after i was awake it did not disturb my mind but it lay like scales upon my eyes and prevented them from registering the fact that the candle was no longer burning then it would begin to seem unintelligible as the thoughts of a former existence must be to a reincarnate spirit the subject of my book would separate itself from me leaving me free to choose whether i would form part of it or no and at the same time my sight would return and i would be astonished to find myself in a state of darkness pleasant and restful enough for the eyes and even more perhaps for my mind to which it appeared incomprehensible without a cause a matter dark indeed i would ask myself what o'clock it could be i could hear the whistling of trains which now nearer and now farther off punctuating the distance like the note of a bird in a forest shewed me in perspective the deserted countryside through which a traveller would be hurrying towards the nearest station the path that he followed being fixed for ever in his memory by the general excitement due to being in a strange place to doing unusual things to the last words of conversation to farewells exchanged beneath an unfamiliar lamp which echoed still in his ears amid the silence of the night and to the delightful prospect of being once again at home i would lay my cheeks gently against the comfortable cheeks of my pillow as plump and blooming as the cheeks of babyhood or i would strike a match to look at my watch nearly midnight the hour when an invalid who has been obliged to start on a journey and to sleep in a strange hotel awakens in a moment of illness and sees with glad relief a streak of daylight shewing under his bedroom door oh joy of joys it is morning the servants will be about in a minute he can ring and some one will come to look after him the thought of being made comfortable gives him strength to endure his pain he is certain he heard footsteps they come nearer and then die away the ray of light beneath his door is extinguished it is midnight some one has turned out the gas the last servant has gone to bed and he must lie all night in agony with no one to bring him any help i would fall asleep and often i would be awake again for short snatches only just long enough to hear the regular creaking of the wainscot or to open my eyes to settle the shifting kaleidoscope of the darkness to savour in an instantaneous flash of perception the sleep which lay heavy upon the furniture the room the whole surroundings of which i formed but an insignificant part and whose unconsciousness i should very soon return to share or perhaps while i was asleep i had returned without the least effort to an earlier stage in my life now for ever outgrown and had come under the thrall of one of my childish terrors such as that old terror of my great uncle's pulling my curls which was effectually dispelled on the day the dawn of a new era to me on which they were finally cropped from my head i had forgotten that event during my sleep i remembered it again immediately i had succeeded in making myself wake up to escape my great uncle's fingers still as a measure of precaution i would bury the whole of my head in the pillow before returning to the world of dreams sometimes too just as eve was created from a rib of adam so a woman would come into existence while i was sleeping conceived from some strain in the position of my limbs formed by the appetite that i was on the point of gratifying she it was i imagined who offered me that gratification my body conscious that its own warmth was permeating hers would strive to become one with her and i would awake the rest of humanity seemed very remote in comparison with this woman whose company i had left but a moment ago my cheek was still warm with her kiss my body bent beneath the weight of hers if as would sometimes happen she had the appearance of some woman whom i had known in waking hours i would abandon myself altogether to the sole quest of her like people who set out on a journey to see with their own eyes some city that they have always longed to visit and imagine that they can taste in reality what has charmed their fancy and then gradually the memory of her would dissolve and vanish until i had forgotten the maiden of my dream when a man is asleep he has in a circle round him the chain of the hours the sequence of the years the order of the heavenly host instinctively when he awakes he looks to these and in an instant reads off his own position on the earth's surface and the amount of time that has elapsed during his slumbers but this ordered procession is apt to grow confused and to break its ranks suppose that towards morning after a night of insomnia sleep descends upon him while he is reading in quite a different position from that in which he normally goes to sleep he has only to lift his arm to arrest the sun and turn it back in its course and at the moment of waking he will have no idea of the time but will conclude that he has just gone to bed or suppose that he gets drowsy in some even more abnormal position sitting in an armchair say after dinner then the world will fall topsy turvy from its orbit the magic chair will carry him at full speed through time and space and when he opens his eyes again he will imagine that he went to sleep months earlier and in some far distant country but for me it was enough if in my own bed my sleep was so heavy as completely to relax my consciousness for then i lost all sense of the place in which i had gone to sleep and when i awoke at midnight not knowing where i was i could not be sure at first who i was i had only the most rudimentary sense of existence such as may lurk and flicker in the depths of an animal's consciousness i was more destitute of human qualities than the cave dweller but then the memory not yet of the place in which i was but of various other places where i had lived and might now very possibly be would come like a rope let down from heaven to draw me up out of the abyss of not being from which i could never have escaped by myself in a flash i would traverse and surmount centuries of civilisation and out of a half visualised succession of oil lamps followed by shirts with turned down collars would put together by degrees the component parts of my ego perhaps the immobility of the things that surround us is forced upon them by our conviction that they are themselves and not anything else and by the immobility of our conceptions of them for it always happened that when i awoke like this and my mind struggled in an unsuccessful attempt to discover where i was everything would be moving round me through the darkness things places years my body still too heavy with sleep to move would make an effort to construe the form which its tiredness took as an orientation of its various members so as to induce from that where the wall lay and the furniture stood to piece together and to give a name to the house in which it must be living its memory the composite memory of its ribs knees and shoulder blades offered it a whole series of rooms in which it had at one time or another slept while the unseen walls kept changing adapting themselves to the shape of each successive room that it remembered whirling madly through the darkness and even before my brain lingering in consideration of when things had happened and of what they had looked like had collected sufficient impressions to enable it to identify the room it my body would recall from each room in succession what the bed was like where the doors were how daylight came in at the windows whether there was a passage outside what i had had in my mind when i went to sleep and had found there when i awoke the stiffened side underneath my body would for instance in trying to fix its position imagine itself to be lying face to the wall in a big bed with a canopy and at once i would say to myself why i must have gone to sleep after all and mamma never came to say good night for i was in the country with my grandfather who died years ago and my body the side upon which i was lying loyally preserving from the past an impression which my mind should never have forgotten brought back before my eyes the glimmering flame of the night light in its bowl of bohemian glass shaped like an urn and hung by chains from the ceiling and the chimney piece of siena marble in my bedroom at combray in my great aunt's house in those far distant days which at the moment of waking seemed present without being clearly penned but would become plainer in a little while when i was properly awake then would come up the memory of a fresh position the wall slid away in another direction i was in my room in mme de saint loup's house in the country good heavens it must be ten o'clock they will have finished dinner i must have overslept myself in the little nap which i always take when i come in from my walk with mme de saint loup before dressing for the evening for many years have now elapsed since the combray days when coming in from the longest and latest walks i would still be in time to see the reflection of the sunset glowing in the panes of my bedroom window it is a very different kind of existence at tansonville now with mme de saint loup and a different kind of pleasure that i now derive from taking walks only in the evenings from visiting by moonlight the roads on which i used to play as a child in the sunshine while the bedroom in which i shall presently fall asleep instead of dressing for dinner from afar off i can see it as we return from our walk with its lamp shining through the window a solitary beacon in the night these shifting and confused gusts of memory never lasted for more than a few seconds it often happened that in my spell of uncertainty as to where i was i did not distinguish the successive theories of which that uncertainty was composed any more than when we watch a horse running we isolate the successive positions of its body as they appear upon a bioscope but i had seen first one and then another of the rooms in which i had slept during my life and in the end i would revisit them all in the long course of my waking dream rooms in winter where on going to bed i would at once bury my head in a nest built up out of the most diverse materials the corner of my pillow the top of my blankets a piece of a shawl the edge of my bed and a copy of an evening paper all of which things i would contrive with the infinite patience of birds building their nests to cement into one whole rooms where in a keen frost i would feel the satisfaction of being shut in from the outer world like the sea swallow which builds at the end of a dark tunnel and is kept warm by the surrounding earth and where the fire keeping in all night i would sleep wrapped up as it were in a great cloak of snug and savoury air shot with the glow of the logs which would break out again in flame in a sort of alcove without walls a cave of warmth dug out of the heart of the room itself a zone of heat whose boundaries were constantly shifting and altering in temperature as gusts of air ran across them to strike freshly upon my face from the corners of the room or from parts near the window or far from the fireplace which had therefore remained cold or rooms in summer where i would delight to feel myself a part of the warm evening where the moonlight striking upon the half opened shutters would throw down to the foot of my bed its enchanted ladder where i would fall asleep as it might be in the open air like a titmouse which the breeze keeps poised in the focus of a sunbeam or sometimes the louis xvi room so cheerful that i could never feel really unhappy even on my first night in it that room where the slender columns which lightly supported its ceiling would part ever so gracefully to indicate where the bed was and to keep it separate sometimes again that little room with the high ceiling hollowed in the form of a pyramid out of two separate storeys and partly walled with mahogany in which from the first moment my mind was drugged by the unfamiliar scent of flowering grasses convinced of the hostility of the violet curtains and of the insolent indifference of a clock that chattered on at the top of its voice as though i were not there while a strange and pitiless mirror with square feet which stood across one corner of the room cleared for itself a site i had not looked to find tenanted in the quiet surroundings of my normal field of vision that room in which my mind forcing itself for hours on end to leave its moorings to elongate itself upwards so as to take on the exact shape of the room and to reach to the summit of that monstrous funnel had passed so many anxious nights while my body lay stretched out in bed my eyes staring upwards my ears straining my nostrils sniffing uneasily and my heart beating until custom had changed the colour of the curtains made the clock keep quiet brought an expression of pity to the cruel slanting face of the glass disguised or even completely dispelled the scent of flowering grasses and distinctly reduced the apparent loftiness of the ceiling custom that skilful but unhurrying manager who begins by torturing the mind for weeks on end with her provisional arrangements whom the mind for all that is fortunate in discovering for without the help of custom it would never contrive by its own efforts to make any room seem habitable certainly i was now well awake my body had turned about for the last time and the good angel of certainty had made all the surrounding objects stand still had set me down under my bedclothes in my bedroom and had fixed approximately in their right places in the uncertain light my chest of drawers my writing table my fireplace the window overlooking the street and both the doors but it was no good my knowing that i was not in any of those houses of which in the stupid moment of waking if i had not caught sight exactly i could still believe in their possible presence for memory was now set in motion as a rule i did not attempt to go to sleep again at once but used to spend the greater part of the night recalling our life in the old days at combray with my great aunt at balbec paris doncières venice and the rest remembering again all the places and people that i had known what i had actually seen of them and what others had told me at combray as every afternoon ended long before the time when i should have to go up to bed and to lie there unsleeping far from my mother and grandmother my bedroom became the fixed point on which my melancholy and anxious thoughts were centred some one had had the happy idea of giving me to distract me on evenings when i seemed abnormally wretched a magic lantern which used to be set on top of my lamp while we waited for dinner time to come in the manner of the master builders and glass painters of gothic days it substituted for the opaqueness of my walls an impalpable iridescence supernatural phenomena of many colours in which legends were depicted as on a shifting and transitory window but my sorrows were only increased because this change of lighting destroyed as nothing else could have done the customary impression i had formed of my room thanks to which the room itself but for the torture of having to go to bed in it had become quite endurable for now i no longer recognised it and i became uneasy as though i were in a room in some hotel or furnished lodging in a place where i had just arrived by train for the first time riding at a jerky trot golo his mind filled with an infamous design issued from the little three cornered forest which dyed dark green the slope of a convenient hill and advanced by leaps and bounds towards the castle of poor geneviève de brabant this castle was cut off short by a curved line which was in fact the circumference of one of the transparent ovals in the slides which were pushed into position through a slot in the lantern it was only the wing of a castle and in front of it stretched a moor on which geneviève stood lost in contemplation wearing a blue girdle the castle and the moor were yellow but i could tell their colour without waiting to see them for before the slides made their appearance the old gold sonorous name of brabant had given me an unmistakable clue golo stopped for a moment and listened sadly to the little speech read aloud by my great aunt which he seemed perfectly to understand for he modified his attitude with a docility not devoid of a degree of majesty so as to conform to the indications given in the text then he rode away at the same jerky trot and nothing could arrest his slow progress if the lantern were moved i could still distinguish golo's horse advancing across the window curtains swelling out with their curves and diving into their folds the body of golo himself being of the same supernatural substance as his steed's overcame all material obstacles everything that seemed to bar his way by taking each as it might be a skeleton and embodying it in himself the door handle for instance over which adapting itself at once would float invincibly his red cloak or his pale face never losing its nobility or its melancholy never shewing any sign of trouble at such a transubstantiation and indeed i found plenty of charm in these bright projections which seemed to have come straight out of a merovingian past and to shed around me the reflections of such ancient history but i cannot express the discomfort i felt at such an intrusion of mystery and beauty into a room which i had succeeded in filling with my own personality until i thought no more of the room than of myself the anaesthetic effect of custom being destroyed i would begin to think and to feel very melancholy things the door handle of my room which was different to me from all the other doorhandles in the world inasmuch as it seemed to open of its own accord and without my having to turn it so unconscious had its manipulation become lo and behold it was now an astral body for golo and as soon as the dinner bell rang i would run down to the dining room where the big hanging lamp ignorant of golo and bluebeard but well acquainted with my family and the dish of stewed beef shed the same light as on every other evening and i would fall into the arms of my mother whom the misfortunes of geneviève de brabant had made all the dearer to me just as the crimes of golo had driven me to a more than ordinarily scrupulous examination of my own conscience but after dinner alas i was soon obliged to leave mamma who stayed talking with the others in the garden if it was fine or in the little parlour where everyone took shelter when it was wet everyone except my grandmother who held that it is a pity to shut oneself indoors in the country and used to carry on endless discussions with my father on the very wettest days because he would send me up to my room with a book instead of letting me stay out of doors that is not the way to make him strong and active she would say sadly especially this little man who needs all the strength and character that he can get my father would shrug his shoulders and study the barometer for he took an interest in meteorology while my mother keeping very quiet so as not to disturb him looked at him with tender respect but not too hard not wishing to penetrate the mysteries of his superior mind but my grandmother in all weathers even when the rain was coming down in torrents and françoise had rushed indoors with the precious wicker armchairs so that they should not get soaked you would see my grandmother pacing the deserted garden lashed by the storm pushing back her grey hair in disorder so that her brows might be more free to imbibe the life giving draughts of wind and rain she would say at last one can breathe and would run up and down the soaking paths too straight and symmetrical for her liking owing to the want of any feeling for nature in the new gardener whom my father had been asking all morning if the weather were going to improve with her keen jerky little step regulated by the various effects wrought upon her soul by the intoxication of the storm the force of hygiene the stupidity of my education and of symmetry in gardens rather than by any anxiety for that was quite unknown to her to save her plum coloured skirt from the spots of mud under which it would gradually disappear to a depth which always provided her maid with a fresh problem and filled her with fresh despair when these walks of my grandmother's took place after dinner there was one thing which never failed to bring her back to the house that was if at one of those points when the revolutions of her course brought her moth like in sight of the lamp in the little parlour where the liqueurs were set out on the card table my great aunt called out to her bathilde come in and stop your husband from drinking brandy for simply to tease her she had brought so foreign a type of mind into my father's family that everyone made a joke of it my great aunt used to make my grandfather who was forbidden liqueurs take just a few drops my poor grandmother would come in and beg and implore her husband not to taste the brandy and he would become annoyed and swallow his few drops all the same and she would go out again sad and discouraged but still smiling for she was so humble and so sweet that her gentleness towards others and her continual subordination of herself and of her own troubles appeared on her face blended in a smile which unlike those seen on the majority of human faces had no trace in it of irony save for herself while for all of us kisses seemed to spring from her eyes which could not look upon those she loved without yearning to bestow upon them passionate caresses the torments inflicted on her by my great aunt the sight of my grandmother's vain entreaties of her in her weakness conquered before she began but still making the futile endeavour to wean my grandfather from his liqueur glass all these were things of the sort to which in later years one can grow so well accustomed as to smile at them to take the tormentor's side with a happy determination which deludes one into the belief that it is not really tormenting but in those days they filled me with such horror that i longed to strike my great aunt and yet as soon as i heard her bathilde come in and stop your husband from drinking brandy in my cowardice i became at once a man and did what all we grown men do when face to face with suffering and injustice i preferred not to see them i ran up to the top of the house to cry by myself in a little room beside the schoolroom and beneath the roof which smelt of orris root and was scented also by a wild currant bush which had climbed up between the stones of the outer wall and thrust a flowering branch in through the half opened window intended for a more special and a baser use this room from which in the daytime i could see as far as the keep of roussainville le pin was for a long time my place of refuge doubtless because it was the only room whose door ï was allowed to lock whenever my occupation was such as required an inviolable solitude reading or dreaming secret tears or paroxysms of desire alas i little knew that my own lack of will power my delicate health and the consequent uncertainty as to my future weighed far more heavily on my grandmother's mind than any little breach of the rules by her husband during those endless perambulations afternoon and evening in which we used to see passing up and down obliquely raised towards the heavens her handsome face with its brown and wrinkled cheeks which with age had acquired almost the purple hue of tilled fields in autumn covered if she were walking abroad by a half lifted veil while upon them either the cold or some sad reflection invariably left the drying traces of an involuntary tear my sole consolation when i went upstairs for the night was that mamma would come in and kiss me after i was in bed but this good night lasted for so short a time she went down again so soon that the moment in which i heard her climb the stairs and then caught the sound of her garden dress of blue muslin from which hung little tassels of plaited straw rustling along the double doored corridor was for me a moment of the keenest sorrow so much did i love that good night that i reached the stage of hoping that it would come as late as possible so as to prolong the time of respite during which mamma would not yet have appeared sometimes when after kissing me she opened the door to go i longed to call her back to say to her kiss me just once again but i knew that then she would at once look displeased for the concession which she made to my wretchedness and agitation in coming up to me with this kiss of peace always annoyed my father who thought such ceremonies absurd and she would have liked to try to induce me to outgrow the need the custom of having her there at all which was a very different thing from letting the custom grow up of my asking her for an additional kiss when she was already crossing the threshold and to see her look displeased destroyed all the sense of tranquillity she had brought me a moment before when she bent her loving face down over my bed and held it out to me like a host for an act of communion in which my lips might drink deeply the sense of her real presence and with it the power to sleep but those evenings on which mamma stayed so short a time in my room were sweet indeed compared to those on which we had guests to dinner and therefore she did not come at all our 'guests' were practically limited to m swann who apart from a few passing strangers was almost the only person who ever came to the house at combray sometimes to a neighbourly dinner but less frequently since his unfortunate marriage as my family did not care to receive his wife and sometimes after dinner uninvited on those evenings when as we sat in front of the house beneath the big chestnut tree and round the iron table we heard from the far end of the garden not the large and noisy rattle which heralded and deafened as he approached with its ferruginous interminable frozen sound any member of the household who had put it out of action by coming in 'without ringing ' but the double peal timid oval gilded of the visitors' bell everyone would at once exclaim a visitor who in the world can it be but they knew quite well that it could only be m swann my great aunt speaking in a loud voice to set an example in a tone which she endeavoured to make sound natural would tell the others not to whisper so that nothing could be more unpleasant for a stranger coming in who would be led to think that people were saying things about him which he was not meant to hear and then my grandmother would be sent out as a scout always happy to find an excuse for an additional turn in the garden which she would utilise to remove surreptitiously as she passed the stakes of a rose tree or two so as to make the roses look a little more natural as a mother might run her hand through her boy's hair after the barber had smoothed it down to make it stick out properly round his head and there we would all stay hanging on the words which would fall from my grandmother's lips when she brought us back her report of the enemy as though there had been some uncertainty among a vast number of possible invaders and then soon after my grandfather would say i can hear swann's voice and indeed one could tell him only by his voice for it was difficult to make out his face with its arched nose and green eyes under a high forehead fringed with fair almost red hair dressed in the bressant style because in the garden we used as little light as possible so as not to attract mosquitoes and i would slip away as though not going for anything in particular to tell them to bring out the syrups for my grandmother made a great point thinking it 'nicer' of their not being allowed to seem anything out of the ordinary which we kept for visitors only although a far younger man m swann was very much attached to my grandfather who had been an intimate friend in his time of swann's father an excellent but an eccentric man in whom the least little thing would it seemed often check the flow of his spirits and divert the current of his thoughts several times in the course of a year i would hear my grandfather tell at table the story which never varied of the behaviour of m swann the elder upon the death of his wife by whose bedside he had watched day and night my grandfather who had not seen him for a long time hastened to join him at the swanns' family property on the outskirts of combray and managed to entice him for a moment weeping profusely out of the death chamber so that he should not be present when the body was laid in its coffin they took a turn or two in the park where there was a little sunshine suddenly m swann seized my grandfather by the arm and cried oh my dear old friend how fortunate we are to be walking here together on such a charming day don't you see how pretty they are all these trees my hawthorns and my new pond on which you have never congratulated me you look as glum as a night cap don't you feel this little breeze ah whatever you may say it's good to be alive all the same my dear amédée and then abruptly the memory of his dead wife returned to him and probably thinking it too complicated to inquire into how at such a time he could have allowed himself to be carried away by an impulse of happiness he confined himself to a gesture which he habitually employed whenever any perplexing question came into his mind that is he passed his hand across his forehead dried his eyes and wiped his glasses and he could never be consoled for the loss of his wife but used to say to my grandfather during the two years for which he survived her it's a funny thing now i very often think of my poor wife but i cannot think of her very much at any one time often but a little at a time like poor old swann became one of my grandfather's favourite phrases which he would apply to all kinds of things and i should have assumed that this father of swann's had been a monster if my grandfather whom i regarded as a better judge than myself and whose word was my law and often led me in the long run to pardon offences which i should have been inclined to condemn had not gone on to exclaim but after all he had a heart of gold for many years albeit and especially before his marriage m swann the younger came often to see them at combray my great aunt and grandparents never suspected that he had entirely ceased to live in the kind of society which his family had frequented or that under the sort of incognito which the name of swann gave him among us they were harbouring with the complete innocence of a family of honest innkeepers who have in their midst some distinguished highwayman and never know it one of the smartest members of the jockey club a particular friend of the comte de paris and of the prince of wales and one of the men most sought after in the aristocratic world of the faubourg saint germain our utter ignorance of the brilliant part which swann was playing in the world of fashion was of course due in part to his own reserve and discretion but also to the fact that middle class people in those days took what was almost a hindu view of society which they held to consist of sharply defined castes so that everyone at his birth found himself called to that station in life which his parents already occupied and nothing except the chance of a brilliant career or of a 'good' marriage could extract you from that station or admit you to a superior caste m swann the father had been a stockbroker and so 'young swann' found himself immured for life in a caste where one's fortune as in a list of taxpayers varied between such and such limits of income we knew the people with whom his father had associated and so we knew his own associates the people with whom he was 'in a position to mix ' if he knew other people besides those were youthful acquaintances on whom the old friends of the family like my relatives shut their eyes all the more good naturedly that swann himself after he was left an orphan still came most faithfully to see us but we would have been ready to wager that the people outside our acquaintance whom swann knew were of the sort to whom he would not have dared to raise his hat had he met them while he was walking with ourselves had there been such a thing as a determination to apply to swann a social coefficient peculiar to himself as distinct from all the other sons of other stockbrokers in his father's position his coefficient would have been rather lower than theirs because leading a very simple life and having always had a craze for 'antiques' and pictures he now lived and piled up his collections in an old house which my grandmother longed to visit but which stood on the quai d'orléans a neighbourhood in which my great aunt thought it most degrading to be quartered are you really a connoisseur now she would say to him i ask for your own sake as you are likely to have 'fakes' palmed off on you by the dealers for she did not in fact endow him with any critical faculty and had no great opinion of the intelligence of a man who in conversation would avoid serious topics and shewed a very dull preciseness not only when he gave us kitchen recipes going into the most minute details but even when my grandmother's sisters were talking to him about art when challenged by them to give an opinion or to express his admiration for some picture he would remain almost impolitely silent and would then make amends by furnishing if he could some fact or other about the gallery in which the picture was hung or the date at which it had been painted but as a rule he would content himself with trying to amuse us by telling us the story of his latest adventure and he would have a fresh story for us on every occasion with some one whom we ourselves knew such as the combray chemist or our cook or our coachman these stories certainly used to make my great aunt laugh but she could never tell whether that was on account of the absurd parts which swann invariably made himself play in the adventures or of the wit that he shewed in telling us of them it is easy to see that you are a regular 'character ' m swann as she was the only member of our family who could be described as a trifle 'common ' she would always take care to remark to strangers when swann was mentioned that he could easily if he had wished to have lived in the boulevard haussmann or the avenue de l'opéra and that he was the son of old m swann who must have left four or five million francs but that it was a fad of his a fad which moreover she thought was bound to amuse other people so much that in paris when m swann called on new year's day bringing her a little packet of marrons glacés she never failed if there were strangers in the room to say to him well m swann and do you still live next door to the bonded vaults so as to be sure of not missing your train when you go to lyons and she would peep out of the corner of her eye over her glasses at the other visitors but if anyone had suggested to my aunt that this swann who in his capacity as the son of old m swann was 'fully qualified' to be received by any of the 'upper middle class ' the most respected barristers and solicitors of paris though he was perhaps a trifle inclined to let this hereditary privilege go into abeyance had another almost secret existence of a wholly different kind that when he left our house in paris saying that he must go home to bed he would no sooner have turned the corner than he would stop retrace his steps and be off to some drawing room on whose like no stockbroker or associate of stockbrokers had ever set eyes that would have seemed to my aunt as extraordinary as to a woman of wider reading the thought of being herself on terms of intimacy with aristaeus of knowing that he would when he had finished his conversation with her plunge deep into the realms of thetis into an empire veiled from mortal eyes in which virgil depicts him as being received with open arms or to be content with an image more likely to have occurred to her for she had seen it painted on the plates we used for biscuits at combray as the thought of having had to dinner ali baba who as soon as he found himself alone and unobserved would make his way into the cave resplendent with its unsuspected treasures one day when he had come to see us after dinner in paris and had begged pardon for being in evening clothes françoise when he had gone told us that she had got it from his coachman that he had been dining with a princess a pretty sort of princess drawled my aunt i know them and she shrugged her shoulders without raising her eyes from her knitting serenely ironical altogether my aunt used to treat him with scant ceremony since she was of the opinion that he ought to feel flattered by our invitations she thought it only right and proper that he should never come to see us in summer without a basket of peaches or raspberries from his garden and that from each of his visits to italy he should bring back some photographs of old masters for me it seemed quite natural therefore to send to him whenever we wanted a recipe for some special sauce or for a pineapple salad for one of our big dinner parties to which he himself would not be invited not seeming of sufficient importance to be served up to new friends who might be in our house for the first time if the conversation turned upon the princes of the house of france gentlemen you and i will never know will we and don't want to do we my great aunt would say tartly to swann who had perhaps a letter from twickenham in his pocket she would make him play accompaniments and turn over music on evenings when my grandmother's sister sang manipulating this creature so rare and refined at other times and in other places with the rough simplicity of a child who will play with some curio from the cabinet no more carefully than if it were a penny toy certainly the swann who was a familiar figure in all the clubs of those days differed hugely from the swann created in my great aunt's mind when of an evening in our little garden at combray after the two shy peals had sounded from the gate she would vitalise by injecting into it everything she had ever heard about the swann family the vague and unrecognisable shape which began to appear with my grandmother in its wake against a background of shadows and could at last be identified by the sound of its voice but then even in the most insignificant details of our daily life none of us can be said to constitute a material whole which is identical for everyone and need only be turned up like a page in an account book or the record of a will our social personality is created by the thoughts of other people even the simple act which we describe as seeing some one we know is to some extent an intellectual process we pack the physical outline of the creature we see with all the ideas we have already formed about him and in the complete picture of him which we compose in our minds those ideas have certainly the principal place in the end they come to fill out so completely the curve of his cheeks to follow so exactly the line of his nose they blend so harmoniously in the sound of his voice that these seem to be no more than a transparent envelope so that each time we see the face or hear the voice it is our own ideas of him which we recognise and to which we listen and so no doubt from the swann they had built up for their own purposes my family had left out in their ignorance a whole crowd of the details of his daily life in the world of fashion details by means of which other people when they met him saw all the graces enthroned in his face and stopping at the line of his arched nose as at a natural frontier but they contrived also to put into a face from which its distinction had been evicted a face vacant and roomy as an untenanted house to plant in the depths of its unvalued eyes a lingering sense uncertain but not unpleasing half memory and half oblivion of idle hours spent together after our weekly dinners round the card table or in the garden during our companionable country life our friend's bodily frame had been so well lined with this sense and with various earlier memories of his family that their own special swann had become to my people a complete and living creature so that even now i have the feeling of leaving some one i know for another quite different person when going back in memory i pass from the swann whom i knew later and more intimately to this early swann this early swann in whom i can distinguish the charming mistakes of my childhood and who incidentally is less like his successor than he is like the other people i knew at that time as though one's life were a series of galleries in which all the portraits of any one period had a marked family likeness the same so to speak tonality this early swann abounding in leisure fragrant with the scent of the great chestnut tree of baskets of raspberries and of a sprig of tarragon and yet one day when my grandmother had gone to ask some favour of a lady whom she had known at the sacré coeur and with whom because of our caste theory she had not cared to keep up any degree of intimacy in spite of several common interests the marquise de villeparisis of the famous house of bouillon this lady had said to her i think you know m swann very well he is a great friend of my nephews the des laumes my grandmother had returned from the call full of praise for the house which overlooked some gardens and in which mme de villeparisis had advised her to rent a flat and also for a repairing tailor and his daughter who kept a little shop in the courtyard into which she had gone to ask them to put a stitch in her skirt which she had torn on the staircase my grandmother had found these people perfectly charming the girl she said was a jewel and the tailor a most distinguished man the finest she had ever seen for in her eyes distinction was a thing wholly independent of social position she was in ecstasies over some answer the tailor had made saying to mamma sévigné would not have said it better and by way of contrast of a nephew of mme de villeparisis whom she had met at the house my dear he is so common now the effect of that remark about swann had been not to raise him in my great aunt's estimation but to lower mme de villeparisis it appeared that the deference which on my grandmother's authority we owed to mme de villeparisis imposed on her the reciprocal obligation to do nothing that would render her less worthy of our regard and that she had failed in her duty in becoming aware of swann's existence and in allowing members of her family to associate with him how should she know swann a lady who you always made out was related to marshal macmahon this view of swann's social atmosphere which prevailed in my family seemed to be confirmed later on by his marriage with a woman of the worst class you might almost say a 'fast' woman whom to do him justice he never attempted to introduce to us for he continued to come to us alone though he came more and more seldom but from whom they thought they could establish on the assumption that he had found her there the circle unknown to them in which he ordinarily moved but on one occasion my grandfather read in a newspaper that m swann was one of the most faithful attendants at the sunday luncheons given by the duc de x whose father and uncle had been among our most prominent statesmen in the reign of louis philippe now my grandfather was curious to learn all the little details which might help him to take a mental share in the private lives of men like mole the duc pasquier or the duc de broglie he was delighted to find that swann associated with people who had known them my great aunt however interpreted this piece of news in a sense discreditable to swann for anyone who chose his associates outside the caste in which he had been born and bred outside his 'proper station ' was condemned to utter degradation in her eyes it seemed to her that such a one abdicated all claim to enjoy the fruits of those friendly relations with people of good position which prudent parents cultivate and store up for their children's benefit for my great aunt had actually ceased to 'see' the son of a lawyer we had known because he had married a 'highness' and had thereby stepped down in her eyes from the respectable position of a lawyer's son to that of those adventurers upstart footmen or stable boys mostly to whom we read that queens have sometimes shewn their favours she objected therefore to my grandfather's plan of questioning swann when next he came to dine with us about these people whose friendship with him we had discovered on the other hand my grandmother's two sisters elderly spinsters who shared her nobility of character but lacked her intelligence declared that they could not conceive what pleasure their brother in law could find in talking about such trifles they were ladies of lofty ambition who for that reason were incapable of taking the least interest in what might be called the 'pinchbeck' things of life even when they had an historic value or generally speaking in anything that was not directly associated with some object aesthetically precious so complete was their negation of interest in anything which seemed directly or indirectly a part of our everyday life that their sense of hearing which had gradually come to understand its own futility when the tone of the conversation at the dinner table became frivolous or merely mundane without the two old ladies' being able to guide it back to the topic dear to themselves would leave its receptive channels unemployed so effectively that they were actually becoming atrophied so that if my grandfather wished to attract the attention of the two sisters he would have to make use of some such alarm signals as mad doctors adopt in dealing with their distracted patients as by beating several times on a glass with the blade of a knife fixing them at the same time with a sharp word and a compelling glance violent methods which the said doctors are apt to bring with them into their everyday life among the sane either from force of professional habit or because they think the whole world a trifle mad their interest grew however when the day before swann was to dine with us and when he had made them a special present of a case of asti my great aunt who had in her hand a copy of the figaro in which to the name of a picture then on view in a corot exhibition were added the words from the collection of m charles swann asked did you see that swann is 'mentioned' in the figaro but i have always told you said my grandmother that he had plenty of taste you would of course retorted my great aunt say anything just to seem different from us for knowing that my grandmother never agreed with her and not being quite confident that it was her own opinion which the rest of us invariably endorsed she wished to extort from us a wholesale condemnation of my grandmother's views against which she hoped to force us into solidarity with her own but we sat silent my grandmother's sisters having expressed a desire to mention to swann this reference to him in the figaro my great aunt dissuaded them whenever she saw in others an advantage however trivial which she herself lacked she would persuade herself that it was no advantage at all but a drawback and would pity so as not to have to envy them i don't think that would please him at all i know very well i should hate to see my name printed like that as large as life in the paper and i shouldn't feel at all flattered if anyone spoke to me about it she did not however put any very great pressure upon my grandmother's sisters for they in their horror of vulgarity had brought to such a fine art the concealment of a personal allusion in a wealth of ingenious circumlocution that it would often pass unnoticed even by the person to whom it was addressed as for my mother her only thought was of managing to induce my father to consent to speak to swann not of his wife but of his daughter whom he worshipped and for whose sake it was understood that he had ultimately made his unfortunate marriage you need only say a word just ask him how she is it must be so very hard for him my father however was annoyed no no you have the most absurd ideas it would be utterly ridiculous but the only one of us in whom the prospect of swann's arrival gave rise to an unhappy foreboding was myself and that was because on the evenings when there were visitors or just m swann in the house mamma did not come up to my room i did not at that time have dinner with the family i came out to the garden after dinner and at nine i said good night and went to bed but on these evenings i used to dine earlier than the others and to come in afterwards and sit at table until eight o'clock when it was understood that i must go upstairs that frail and precious kiss which mamma used always to leave upon my lips when i was in bed and just going to sleep i had to take with me from the dining room to my own and to keep inviolate all the time that it took me to undress without letting its sweet charm be broken without letting its volatile essence diffuse itself and evaporate and just on those very evenings when i must needs take most pains to receive it with due formality i had to snatch it to seize it instantly and in public without even having the time or being properly free to apply to what i was doing the punctiliousness which madmen use who compel themselves to exclude all other thoughts from their minds while they are shutting a door so that when the sickness of uncertainty sweeps over them again they can triumphantly face and overcome it with the recollection of the precise moment in which the door was shut we were all in the garden when the double peal of the gate bell sounded shyly everyone knew that it must be swann and yet they looked at one another inquiringly and sent my grandmother scouting see that you thank him intelligibly for the wine my grandfather warned his two sisters in law you know how good it is and it is a huge case now don't start whispering said my great aunt how would you like to come into a house and find everyone muttering to themselves ah there's m swann cried my father let's ask him if he thinks it will be fine to morrow my mother fancied that a word from her would wipe out all the unpleasantness which my family had contrived to make swann feel since his marriage she found an opportunity to draw him aside for a moment but i followed her i could not bring myself to let her go out of reach of me while i felt that in a few minutes i should have to leave her in the dining room and go up to my bed without the consoling thought as on ordinary evenings that she would come up later to kiss me now m swann she said do tell me about your daughter i am sure she shews a taste already for nice things like her papa come along and sit down here with us all on the verandah said my grandfather coming up to him my mother had to abandon the quest but managed to extract from the restriction itself a further refinement of thought as great poets do when the tyranny of rhyme forces them into the discovery of their finest lines we can talk about her again when we are by ourselves she said or rather whispered to swann it is only a mother who can understand i am sure that hers would agree with me and so we all sat down round the iron table i should have liked not to think of the hours of anguish which i should have to spend that evening alone in my room without the possibility of going to sleep i tried to convince myself that they were of no importance really since i should have forgotten them next morning and to fix my mind on thoughts of the future which would carry me as on a bridge across the terrifying abyss that yawned at my feet but my mind strained by this foreboding distended like the look which i shot at my mother would not allow any other impression to enter thoughts did indeed enter it but only on the condition that they left behind them every element of beauty or even of quaintness by which i might have been distracted or beguiled as a surgical patient by means of a local anaesthetic can look on with a clear consciousness while an operation is being performed upon him and yet feel nothing i could repeat to myself some favourite lines or watch my grandfather attempting to talk to swann about the duc d'audriffet pasquier without being able to kindle any emotion from one or amusement from the other hardly had my grandfather begun to question swann about that orator when one of my grandmother's sisters in whose ears the question echoed like a solemn but untimely silence which her natural politeness bade her interrupt addressed the other with just fancy flora i met a young swedish governess to day who told me some most interesting things about the co operative movement in scandinavia we really must have her to dine here one evening to be sure said her sister flora but i haven't wasted my time either i met such a clever old gentleman at m vinteuil's who knows maubant quite well and maubant has told him every little thing about how he gets up his parts it is the most interesting thing i ever heard he is a neighbour of m vinteuil's and i never knew and he is so nice besides m vinteuil is not the only one who has nice neighbours cried my aunt céline in a voice which seemed loud because she was so timid and seemed forced because she had been planning the little speech for so long darting as she spoke what she called a 'significant glance' at swann and my aunt flora who realised that this veiled utterance was céline's way of thanking swann intelligibly for the asti looked at him with a blend of congratulation and irony either just because she wished to underline her sister's little epigram or because she envied swann his having inspired it or merely because she imagined that he was embarrassed and could not help having a little fun at his expense i think it would be worth while flora went on to have this old gentleman to dinner when you get him upon maubant or mme materna he will talk for hours on end that must be delightful sighed my grandfather in whose mind nature had unfortunately forgotten to include any capacity whatsoever for becoming passionately interested in the co operative movement among the ladies of sweden or in the methods employed by maubant to get up his parts just as it had forgotten to endow my grandmother's two sisters with a grain of that precious salt which one has oneself to 'add to taste' in order to extract any savour from a narrative of the private life of mole or of the comte de paris i say exclaimed swann to my grandfather what i was going to tell you has more to do than you might think with what you were asking me just now for in some respects there has been very little change i came across a passage in saint simon this morning which would have amused you it is in the volume which covers his mission to spain not one of the best little more in fact than a journal but at least it is a journal wonderfully well written which fairly distinguishes it from the devastating journalism that we feel bound to read in these days morning noon and night i do not agree with you there are some days when i find reading the papers very pleasant indeed my aunt flora broke in to show swann that she had read the note about his corot in the figaro yes aunt céline went one better when they write about things or people in whom we are interested i don't deny it answered swann in some bewilderment the fault i find with our journalism is that it forces us to take an interest in some fresh triviality or other every day whereas only three or four books in a lifetime give us anything that is of real importance suppose that every morning when we tore the wrapper off our paper with fevered hands a transmutation were to take place and we were to find inside it oh i don't know shall we say pascal's pensées he articulated the title with an ironic emphasis so as not to appear pedantic and then in the gilt and tooled volumes which we open once in ten years he went on shewing that contempt for the things of this world which some men of the world like to affect we should read that the queen of the hellenes had arrived at cannes or that the princesse de léon had given a fancy dress ball in that way we should arrive at the right proportion between 'information' and 'publicity ' but at once regretting that he had allowed himself to speak even in jest of serious matters he added ironically we are having a most entertaining conversation i cannot think why we climb to these lofty summits and then turning to my grandfather well saint simon tells how maulevrier had had the audacity to offer his hand to his sons you remember how he says of maulevrier 'never did i find in that coarse bottle anything but ill humour boorishness and folly ' coarse or not i know bottles in which there is something very different said flora briskly feeling bound to thank swann as well as her sister since the present of asti had been addressed to them both céline began to laugh swann was puzzled but went on 'i cannot say whether it was his ignorance or a trap ' writes saint simon 'he wished to give his hand to my children i noticed it in time to prevent him ' my grandfather was already in ecstasies over ignorance or a trap but miss céline the name of saint simon a 'man of letters ' having arrested the complete paralysis of her sense of hearing had grown angry what you admire that do you well it is clever enough but what is the point of it does he mean that one man isn't as good as another what difference can it make whether he is a duke or a groom so long as he is intelligent and good he had a fine way of bringing up his children your saint simon if he didn't teach them to shake hands with all honest men really and truly it's abominable and you dare to quote it and my grandfather utterly depressed realising how futile it would be for him against this opposition to attempt to get swann to tell him the stories which would have amused him murmured to my mother just tell me again that line of yours which always comforts me so much on these occasions oh yes what virtues lord thou makest us abhor good that is very good i never took my eyes off my mother i knew that when they were at table i should not be permitted to stay there for the whole of dinner time and that mamma for fear of annoying my father would not allow me to give her in public the series of kisses that she would have had in my room and so i promised myself that in the dining room as they began to eat and drink and as i felt the hour approach i would put beforehand into this kiss which was bound to be so brief and stealthy in execution everything that my own efforts could put into it would look out very carefully first the exact spot on her cheek where i would imprint it and would so prepare my thoughts that i might be able thanks to these mental preliminaries to consecrate the whole of the minute mamma would allow me to the sensation of her cheek against my lips as a painter who can have his subject for short sittings only prepares his palette and from what he remembers and from rough notes does in advance everything which he possibly can do in the sitter's absence but to night before the dinner bell had sounded my grandfather said with unconscious cruelty the little man looks tired he'd better go up to bed besides we are dining late to night and my father who was less scrupulous than my grandmother or mother in observing the letter of a treaty went on yes run along to bed with you i would have kissed mamma then and there but at that moment the dinner bell rang no no leave your mother alone you've said good night quite enough these exhibitions are absurd go on upstairs and so i must set forth without viaticum must climb each step of the staircase 'against my heart ' as the saying is climbing in opposition to my heart's desire which was to return to my mother since she had not by her kiss given my heart leave to accompany me forth that hateful staircase up which i always passed with such dismay gave out a smell of varnish which had to some extent absorbed made definite and fixed the special quality of sorrow that i felt each evening and made it perhaps even more cruel to my sensibility because when it assumed this olfactory guise my intellect was powerless to resist it when we have gone to sleep with a maddening toothache and are conscious of it only as a little girl whom we attempt time after time to pull out of the water or as a line of molière which we repeat incessantly to ourselves it is a great relief to wake up so that our intelligence can disentangle the idea of toothache from any artificial semblance of heroism or rhythmic cadence it was the precise converse of this relief which i felt when my anguish at having to go up to my room invaded my consciousness in a manner infinitely more rapid instantaneous almost a manner at once insidious and brutal as i breathed in a far more poisonous thing than any moral penetration the peculiar smell of the varnish upon that staircase once in my room i had to stop every loophole to close the shutters to dig my own grave as i turned down the bed clothes to wrap myself in the shroud of my nightshirt but before burying myself in the iron bed which had been placed there because on summer nights i was too hot among the red curtains of the four poster i was stirred to revolt and attempted the desperate stratagem of a condemned prisoner i wrote to my mother begging her to come upstairs for an important reason which i could not put in writing my fear was that françoise my aunt's cook who used to be put in charge of me when i was at combray might refuse to take my note i had a suspicion that in her eyes to carry a message to my mother when there was a stranger in the room would appear flatly inconceivable just as it would be for the door keeper of a theatre to hand a letter to an actor upon the stage for things which might or might not be done she possessed a code at once imperious abundant subtle and uncompromising on points themselves imperceptible or irrelevant which gave it a resemblance to those ancient laws which combine such cruel ordinances as the massacre of infants at the breast with prohibitions of exaggerated refinement against seething the kid in his mother's milk or eating of the sinew which is upon the hollow of the thigh this code if one could judge it by the sudden obstinacy which she would put into her refusal to carry out certain of our instructions seemed to have foreseen such social complications and refinements of fashion as nothing in françoise's surroundings or in her career as a servant in a village household could have put into her head and we were obliged to assume that there was latent in her some past existence in the ancient history of france noble and little understood just as there is in those manufacturing towns where old mansions still testify to their former courtly days and chemical workers toil among delicately sculptured scenes of the miracle of theophilus or the quatre fils aymon in this particular instance the article of her code which made it highly improbable that barring an outbreak of fire françoise would go down and disturb mamma when m swann was there for so unimportant a person as myself was one embodying the respect she shewed not only for the family as for the dead for the clergy or for royalty but also for the stranger within our gates a respect which i should perhaps have found touching in a book but which never failed to irritate me on her lips because of the solemn and gentle tones in which she would utter it and which irritated me more than usual this evening when the sacred character in which she invested the dinner party might have the effect of making her decline to disturb its ceremonial but to give myself one chance of success i lied without hesitation telling her that it was not in the least myself who had wanted to write to mamma but mamma who on saying good night to me had begged me not to forget to send her an answer about something she had asked me to find and that she would certainly be very angry if this note were not taken to her i think that françoise disbelieved me for like those primitive men whose senses were so much keener than our own she could immediately detect by signs imperceptible by the rest of us the truth or falsehood of anything that we might wish to conceal from her she studied the envelope for five minutes as though an examination of the paper itself and the look of my handwriting could enlighten her as to the nature of the contents or tell her to which article of her code she ought to refer the matter then she went out with an air of resignation which seemed to imply what a dreadful thing for parents to have a child like this a moment later she returned to say that they were still at the ice stage and that it was impossible for the butler to deliver the note at once in front of everybody but that when the finger bowls were put round he would find a way of slipping it into mamma's hand at once my anxiety subsided it was now no longer as it had been a moment ago until to morrow that i had lost my mother for my little line was going to annoy her no doubt and doubly so because this contrivance would make me ridiculous in swann's eyes but was going all the same to admit me invisibly and by stealth into the same room as herself was going to whisper from me into her ear for that forbidden and unfriendly dining room where but a moment ago the ice itself with burned nuts in it and the finger bowls seemed to me to be concealing pleasures that were mischievous and of a mortal sadness because mamma was tasting of them and i was far away had opened its doors to me and like a ripe fruit which bursts through its skin was going to pour out into my intoxicated heart the gushing sweetness of mamma's attention while she was reading what i had written now i was no longer separated from her the barriers were down an exquisite thread was binding us besides that was not all for surely mamma would come as for the agony through which i had just passed i imagined that swann would have laughed heartily at it if he had read my letter and had guessed its purpose whereas on the contrary as i was to learn in due course a similar anguish had been the bane of his life for many years and no one perhaps could have understood my feelings at that moment so well as himself to him that anguish which lies in knowing that the creature one adores is in some place of enjoyment where oneself is not and cannot follow to him that anguish came through love to which it is in a sense predestined by which it must be equipped and adapted but when as had befallen me such an anguish possesses one's soul before love has yet entered into one's life then it must drift awaiting love's coming vague and free without precise attachment at the disposal of one sentiment to day of another to morrow of filial piety or affection for a comrade and the joy with which i first bound myself apprentice when françoise returned to tell me that my letter would be delivered swann too had known well that false joy which a friend can give us or some relative of the woman we love when on his arrival at the house or theatre where she is to be found for some ball or party or 'first night' at which he is to meet her he sees us wandering outside desperately awaiting some opportunity of communicating with her he recognises us greets us familiarly and asks what we are doing there and when we invent a story of having some urgent message to give to his relative or friend he assures us that nothing could be more simple takes us in at the door and promises to send her down to us in five minutes how much we love him as at that moment i loved françoise the good natured intermediary who by a single word has made supportable human almost propitious the inconceivable infernal scene of gaiety in the thick of which we had been imagining swarms of enemies perverse and seductive beguiling away from us even making laugh at us the woman whom we love if we are to judge of them by him this relative who has accosted us and who is himself an initiate in those cruel mysteries then the other guests cannot be so very demoniacal those inaccessible and torturing hours into which she had gone to taste of unknown pleasures behold a breach in the wall and we are through it behold one of the moments whose series will go to make up their sum a moment as genuine as the rest if not actually more important to ourself because our mistress is more intensely a part of it we picture it to ourselves we possess it we intervene upon it almost we have created it namely the moment in which he goes to tell her that we are waiting there below and very probably the other moments of the party will not be essentially different will contain nothing else so exquisite or so well able to make us suffer since this kind friend has assured us that of course she will be delighted to come down it will be far more amusing for her to talk to you than to be bored up there alas swann had learned by experience that the good intentions of a third party are powerless to control a woman who is annoyed to find herself pursued even into a ball room by a man whom she does not love too often the kind friend comes down again alone my mother did not appear but with no attempt to safeguard my self respect which depended upon her keeping up the fiction that she had asked me to let her know the result of my search for something or other made françoise tell me in so many words there is no answer words i have so often since then heard the hall porters in 'mansions' and the flunkeys in gambling clubs and the like repeat to some poor girl who replies in bewilderment what he's said nothing it's not possible you did give him my letter didn't you very well i shall wait a little longer and just as she invariably protests that she does not need the extra gas which the porter offers to light for her and sits on there hearing nothing further except an occasional remark on the weather which the porter exchanges with a messenger whom he will send off suddenly when he notices the time to put some customer's wine on the ice so having declined françoise's offer to make me some tea or to stay beside me i let her go off again to the servants' hall and lay down and shut my eyes and tried not to hear the voices of my family who were drinking their coffee in the garden but after a few seconds i realised that by writing that line to mamma by approaching at the risk of making her angry so near to her that i felt i could reach out and grasp the moment in which i should see her again i had cut myself off from the possibility of going to sleep until i actually had seen her and my heart began to beat more and more painfully as i increased my agitation by ordering myself to keep calm and to acquiesce in my ill fortune then suddenly my anxiety subsided a feeling of intense happiness coursed through me as when a strong medicine begins to take effect and one's pain vanishes i had formed a resolution to abandon all attempts to go to sleep without seeing mamma and had decided to kiss her at all costs even with the certainty of being in disgrace with her for long afterwards when she herself came up to bed the tranquillity which followed my anguish made me extremely alert no less than my sense of expectation my thirst for and my fear of danger noiselessly i opened the window and sat down on the foot of my bed hardly daring to move in case they should hear me from below things outside seemed also fixed in mute expectation so as not to disturb the moonlight which duplicating each of them and throwing it back by the extension forwards of a shadow denser and more concrete than its substance had made the whole landscape seem at once thinner and longer like a map which after being folded up is spread out upon the ground what had to move a leaf of the chestnut tree for instance moved but its minute shuddering complete finished to the least detail and with utmost delicacy of gesture made no discord with the rest of the scene and yet was not merged in it remaining clearly outlined exposed upon this surface of silence which absorbed nothing from them the most distant sounds those which must have come from gardens at the far end of the town could be distinguished with such exact 'finish' that the impression they gave of coming from a distance seemed due only to their 'pianissimo' execution like those movements on muted strings so well performed by the orchestra of the conservatoire that although one does not lose a single note one thinks all the same that they are being played somewhere outside a long way from the concert hall so that all the old subscribers and my grandmother's sisters too when swann had given them his seats used to strain their ears as if they had caught the distant approach of an army on the march which had not yet rounded the corner of the rue de trévise i was well aware that i had placed myself in a position than which none could be counted upon to involve me in graver consequences at my parents' hands consequences far graver indeed than a stranger would have imagined and such as he would have thought could follow only some really shameful fault but in the system of education which they had given me faults were not classified in the same order as in that of other children and i had been taught to place at the head of the list doubtless because there was no other class of faults from which i needed to be more carefully protected those in which i can now distinguish the common feature that one succumbs to them by yielding to a nervous impulse but such words as these last had never been uttered in my hearing no one had yet accounted for my temptations in a way which might have led me to believe that there was some excuse for my giving in to them or that i was actually incapable of holding out against them yet i could easily recognise this class of transgressions by the anguish of mind which preceded as well as by the rigour of the punishment which followed them and i knew that what i had just done was in the same category as certain other sins for which i had been severely chastised though infinitely more serious than they when i went out to meet my mother as she herself came up to bed and when she saw that i had remained up so as to say good night to her again in the passage i should not be allowed to stay in the house a day longer i should be packed off to school next morning so much was certain very good had i been obliged the next moment to hurl myself out of the window i should still have preferred such a fate for what i wanted now was mamma and to say good night to her i had gone too far along the road which led to the realisation of this desire to be able to retrace my steps i could hear my parents' footsteps as they went with swann and when the rattle of the gate assured me that he had really gone i crept to the window mamma was asking my father if he had thought the lobster good and whether m swann had had some of the coffee and pistachio ice i thought it rather so so she was saying next time we shall have to try another flavour i can't tell you said my great aunt what a change i find in swann he is quite antiquated she had grown so accustomed to seeing swann always in the same stage of adolescence that it was a shock to her to find him suddenly less young than the age she still attributed to him and the others too were beginning to remark in swann that abnormal excessive scandalous senescence meet only in a celibate in one of that class for whom it seems that the great day which knows no morrow must be longer than for other men since for such a one it is void of promise and from its dawn the moments steadily accumulate without any subsequent partition among his offspring i fancy he has a lot of trouble with that wretched wife of his who 'lives' with a certain monsieur de charlus as all combray knows it's the talk of the town my mother observed that in spite of this he had looked much less unhappy of late and he doesn't nearly so often do that trick of his so like his father of wiping his eyes and passing his hand across his forehead i think myself that in his heart of hearts he doesn't love his wife any more why of course he doesn't answered my grandfather he wrote me a letter about it ages ago to which i took care to pay no attention but it left no doubt as to his feelings let alone his love for his wife hullo you two you never thanked him for the asti he went on turning to his sisters in law what we never thanked him i think between you and me that i put it to him quite neatly replied my aunt flora yes you managed it very well i admired you for it said my aunt céline but you did it very prettily too yes i liked my expression about 'nice neighbours ' what do you call that thanking him shouted my grandfather i heard that all right but devil take me if i guessed it was meant for swann you may be quite sure he never noticed it come come swann is not a fool i am positive he appreciated the compliment you didn't expect me to tell him the number of bottles or to guess what he paid for them my father and mother were left alone and sat down for a moment then my father said well shall we go up to bed as you wish dear though i don't feel in the least like sleeping i don't know why it can't be the coffee ice it wasn't strong enough to keep me awake like this but i see a light in the servants' hall poor françoise has been sitting up for me so i will get her to unhook me while you go and undress my mother opened the latticed door which led from the hall to the staircase presently i heard her coming upstairs to close her window i went quietly into the passage my heart was beating so violently that i could hardly move but at least it was throbbing no longer with anxiety but with terror and with joy i saw in the well of the stair a light coming upwards from mamma's candle then i saw mamma herself i threw myself upon her for an instant she looked at me in astonishment not realising what could have happened then her face assumed an expression of anger she said not a single word to me and for that matter i used to go for days on end without being spoken to for far less offences than this a single word from mamma would have been an admission that further intercourse with me was within the bounds of possibility and that might perhaps have appeared to me more terrible still as indicating that with such a punishment as was in store for me mere silence and even anger were relatively puerile a word from her then would have implied the false calm in which one converses with a servant to whom one has just decided to give notice the kiss one bestows on a son who is being packed off to enlist which would have been denied him if it had merely been a matter of being angry with him for a few days but she heard my father coming from the dressing room where he had gone to take off his clothes and to avoid the 'scene' which he would make if he saw me she said in a voice half stifled by her anger run away at once don't let your father see you standing there like a crazy jane but i begged her again to come and say good night to me terrified as i saw the light from my father's candle already creeping up the wall but also making use of his approach as a means of blackmail in the hope that my mother not wishing him to find me there as find me he must if she continued to hold out would give in to me and say go back to your room i will come too late my father was upon us instinctively i murmured though no one heard me i am done for i was not however my father used constantly to refuse to let me do things which were quite clearly allowed by the more liberal charters granted me by my mother and grandmother because he paid no heed to 'principles ' and because in his sight there were no such things as 'rights of man ' for some quite irrelevant reason or for no reason at all he would at the last moment prevent me from taking some particular walk one so regular and so consecrated to my use that to deprive me of it was a clear breach of faith or again as he had done this evening long before the appointed hour he would snap out run along up to bed now no excuses but then again simply because he was devoid of principles in my grandmother's sense so he could not properly speaking be called inexorable he looked at me for a moment with an air of annoyance and surprise and then when mamma had told him not without some embarrassment what had happened said to her go along with him then you said just now that you didn't feel like sleep so stay in his room for a little i don't need anything but dear my mother answered timidly whether or not i feel like sleep is not the point we must not make the child accustomed there's no question of making him accustomed said my father with a shrug of the shoulders you can see quite well that the child is unhappy after all we aren't gaolers you'll end by making him ill and a lot of good that will do there are two beds in his room tell françoise to make up the big one for you and stay beside him for the rest of the night i'm off to bed anyhow i'm not nervous like you good night it was impossible for me to thank my father what he called my sentimentality would have exasperated him i stood there not daring to move he was still confronting us an immense figure in his white nightshirt crowned with the pink and violet scarf of indian cashmere in which since he had begun to suffer from neuralgia he used to tie up his head standing like abraham in the engraving after benozzo gozzoli which m swann had given me telling sarah that she must tear herself away from isaac many years have passed since that night the wall of the staircase up which i had watched the light of his candle gradually climb was long ago demolished and in myself too many things have perished which i imagined would last for ever and new structures have arisen giving birth to new sorrows and new joys which in those days i could not have foreseen just as now the old are difficult of comprehension it is a long time too since my father has been able to tell mamma to go with the child never again will such hours be possible for me but of late i have been increasingly able to catch if i listen attentively the sound of the sobs which i had the strength to control in my father's presence and which broke out only when i found myself alone with mamma actually their echo has never ceased it is only because life is now growing more and more quiet round about me that i hear them afresh like those convent bells which are so effectively drowned during the day by the noises of the streets that one would suppose them to have been stopped for ever until they sound out again through the silent evening air mamma spent that night in my room when i had just committed a sin so deadly that i was waiting to be banished from the household my parents gave me a far greater concession than i should ever have won as the reward of a good action even at the moment when it manifested itself in this crowning mercy my father's conduct towards me was still somewhat arbitrary and regardless of my deserts as was characteristic of him and due to the fact that his actions were generally dictated by chance expediencies rather than based on any formal plan and perhaps even what i called his strictness when he sent me off to bed deserved that title less really than my mother's or grandmother's attitude for his nature which in some respects differed more than theirs from my own had probably prevented him from guessing until then how wretched i was every evening a thing which my mother and grandmother knew well but they loved me enough to be unwilling to spare me that suffering which they hoped to teach me to overcome so as to reduce my nervous sensibility and to strengthen my will as for my father whose affection for me was of another kind i doubt if he would have shewn so much courage for as soon as he had grasped the fact that i was unhappy he had said to my mother go and comfort him mamma stayed all night in my room and it seemed that she did not wish to mar by recrimination those hours so different from anything that i had had a right to expect for when françoise who guessed that something extraordinary must have happened when she saw mamma sitting by my side holding my hand and letting me cry unchecked said to her but madame what is little master crying for she replied why françoise he doesn't know himself it is his nerves make up the big bed for me quickly and then go off to your own and thus for the first time my unhappiness was regarded no longer as a fault for which i must be punished but as an involuntary evil which had been officially recognised a nervous condition for which i was in no way responsible i had the consolation that i need no longer mingle apprehensive scruples with the bitterness of my tears i could weep henceforward without sin i felt no small degree of pride either in françoise presence at this return to humane conditions which not an hour after mamma had refused to come up to my room and had sent the snubbing message that i was to go to sleep raised me to the dignity of a grown up person brought me of a sudden to a sort of puberty of sorrow to emancipation from tears i ought then to have been happy i was not it struck me that my mother had just made a first concession which must have been painful to her that it was a first step down from the ideal she had formed for me and that for the first time she with all her courage had to confess herself beaten it struck me that if i had just scored a victory it was over her that i had succeeded as sickness or sorrow or age might have succeeded in relaxing her will in altering her judgment that this evening opened a new era must remain a black date in the calendar and if i had dared now i should have said to mamma no i don't want you you mustn't sleep here but i was conscious of the practical wisdom of what would be called nowadays the realism with which she tempered the ardent idealism of my grandmother's nature and i knew that now the mischief was done she would prefer to let me enjoy the soothing pleasure of her company and not to disturb my father again certainly my mother's beautiful features seemed to shine again with youth that evening as she sat gently holding my hands and trying to check my tears but just for that reason it seemed to me that this should not have happened her anger would have been less difficult to endure than this new kindness which my childhood had not known i felt that i had with an impious and secret finger traced a first wrinkle upon her soul and made the first white hair shew upon her head this thought redoubled my sobs and then i saw that mamma who had never allowed herself to go to any length of tenderness with me was suddenly overcome by my tears and had to struggle to keep back her own then as she saw that i had noticed this she said to me with a smile why my little buttercup my little canary boy he's going to make mamma as silly as himself if this goes on look since you can't sleep and mamma can't either we mustn't go on in this stupid way we must do something i'll get one of your books but i had none there would you like me to get out the books now that your grandmother is going to give you for your birthday just think it over first and don't be disappointed if there is nothing new for you then i was only too delighted and mamma went to find a parcel of books in which i could not distinguish through the paper in which it was wrapped any more than its squareness and size but which even at this first glimpse brief and obscure as it was bade fair to eclipse already the paint box of last new year's day and the silkworms of the year before it contained la mare au diable françois le champi la petite fadette and les maîtres sonneurs my grandmother as i learned afterwards had at first chosen mussel's poems a volume of rousseau and indiana for while she considered light reading as unwholesome as sweets and cakes she did not reflect that the strong breath of genius must have upon the very soul of a child an influence at once more dangerous and less quickening than those of fresh air and country breezes upon his body but when my father had seemed almost to regard her as insane on learning the names of the books she proposed to give me she had journeyed back by herself to jouy le vicomte to the bookseller's so that there should be no fear of my not having my present in time it was a burning hot day and she had come home so unwell that the doctor had warned my mother not to allow her again to tire herself in that way and had there fallen back upon the four pastoral novels of george sand my dear she had said to mamma i could not allow myself to give the child anything that was not well written the truth was that she could never make up her mind to purchase anything from which no intellectual profit was to be derived and above all that profit which good things bestowed on us by teaching us to seek our pleasures elsewhere than in the barren satisfaction of worldly wealth even when she had to make some one a present of the kind called 'useful ' when she had to give an armchair or some table silver or a walking stick she would choose 'antiques ' as though their long desuetude had effaced from them any semblance of utility and fitted them rather to instruct us in the lives of the men of other days than to serve the common requirements of our own she would have liked me to have in my room photographs of ancient buildings or of beautiful places but at the moment of buying them and for all that the subject of the picture had an aesthetic value of its own she would find that vulgarity and utility had too prominent a part in them through the mechanical nature of their reproduction by photography she attempted by a subterfuge if not to eliminate altogether their commercial banality at least to minimise it to substitute for the bulk of it what was art still to introduce as it might be several 'thicknesses' of art instead of photographs of chartres cathedral of the fountains of saint cloud or of vesuvius she would inquire of swann whether some great painter had not made pictures of them and preferred to give me photographs of 'chartres cathedral' after corot of the 'fountains of saint cloud' after hubert robert and of 'vesuvius' after turner which were a stage higher in the scale of art but although the photographer had been prevented from reproducing directly the masterpieces or the beauties of nature and had there been replaced by a great artist he resumed his odious position when it came to reproducing the artist's interpretation accordingly having to reckon again with vulgarity my grandmother would endeavour to postpone the moment of contact still further she would ask swann if the picture had not been engraved preferring when possible old engravings with some interest of association apart from themselves such for example as shew us a masterpiece in a state in which we can no longer see it to day as morghen's print of the 'cenacolo' of leonardo before it was spoiled by restoration it must be admitted that the results of this method of interpreting the art of making presents were not always happy the idea which i formed of venice from a drawing by titian which is supposed to have the lagoon in the background was certainly far less accurate than what i have since derived from ordinary photographs we could no longer keep count in the family when my great aunt tried to frame an indictment of my grandmother of all the armchairs she had presented to married couples young and old which on a first attempt to sit down upon them had at once collapsed beneath the weight of their recipient but my grandmother would have thought it sordid to concern herself too closely with the solidity of any piece of furniture in which could still be discerned a flourish a smile a brave conceit of the past and even what in such pieces supplied a material need since it did so in a manner to which we are no longer accustomed was as charming to her as one of those old forms of speech in which we can still see traces of a metaphor whose fine point has been worn away by the rough usage of our modern tongue in precisely the same way the pastoral novels of george sand which she was giving me for my birthday were regular lumber rooms of antique furniture full of expressions that have fallen out of use and returned as imagery such as one finds now only in country dialects and my grandmother had bought them in preference to other books just as she would have preferred to take a house that had a gothic dovecot or some other such piece of antiquity as would have a pleasant effect on the mind filling it with a nostalgic longing for impossible journeys through the realms of time mamma sat down by my bed she had chosen françois le champi whose reddish cover and incomprehensible title gave it a distinct personality in my eyes and a mysterious attraction i had not then read any real novels i had heard it said that george sand was a typical novelist that prepared me in advance to imagine that françois le champi contained something inexpressibly delicious the course of the narrative where it tended to arouse curiosity or melt to pity certain modes of expression which disturb or sadden the reader and which with a little experience he may recognise as 'common form' in novels seemed to me then distinctive for to me a new book was not one of a number of similar objects but was like an individual man unmatched and with no cause of existence beyond himself an intoxicating whiff of the peculiar essence of françois le champi beneath the everyday incidents the commonplace thoughts and hackneyed words i could hear or overhear an intonation a rhythmic utterance fine and strange the 'action' began to me it seemed all the more obscure because in those days when i read to myself i used often while i turned the pages to dream of something quite different and to the gaps which this habit made in my knowledge of the story more were added by the fact that when it was mamma who was reading to me aloud she left all the love scenes out and so all the odd changes which take place in the relations between the miller's wife and the boy changes which only the birth and growth of love can explain seemed to me plunged and steeped in a mystery the key to which as i could readily believe lay in that strange and pleasant sounding name of champi which draped the boy who bore it i knew not why in its own bright colour purpurate and charming if my mother was not a faithful reader she was none the less admirable when reading a work in which she found the note of true feeling by the respectful simplicity of her interpretation and by the sound of her sweet and gentle voice it was the same in her daily life when it was not works of art but men and women whom she was moved to pity or admire it was touching to observe with what deference she would banish from her voice her gestures from her whole conversation now the note of joy which might have distressed some mother who had long ago lost a child now the recollection of an event or anniversary which might have reminded some old gentleman of the burden of his years now the household topic which might have bored some young man of letters and so when she read aloud the prose of george sand prose which is everywhere redolent of that generosity and moral distinction which mamma had learned from my grandmother to place above all other qualities in life and which i was not to teach her until much later to refrain from placing in the same way above all other qualities in literature taking pains to banish from her voice any weakness or affectation which might have blocked its channel for that powerful stream of language she supplied all the natural tenderness all the lavish sweetness which they demanded to phrases which seemed to have been composed for her voice and which were all so to speak within her compass she came to them with the tone that they required with the cordial accent which existed before they were which dictated them but which is not to be found in the words themselves and by these means she smoothed away as she read on any harshness there might be or discordance in the tenses of verbs endowing the imperfect and the preterite with all the sweetness which there is in generosity all the melancholy which there is in love guided the sentence that was drawing to an end towards that which was waiting to begin now hastening now slackening the pace of the syllables so as to bring them despite their difference of quantity into a uniform rhythm and breathed into this quite ordinary prose a kind of life continuous and full of feeling my agony was soothed i let myself be borne upon the current of this gentle night on which i had my mother by my side i knew that such a night could not be repeated that the strongest desire i had in the world namely to keep my mother in my room through the sad hours of darkness ran too much counter to general requirements and to the wishes of others for such a concession as had been granted me this evening to be anything but a rare and casual exception to morrow night i should again be the victim of anguish and mamma would not stay by my side but when these storms of anguish grew calm i could no longer realise their existence besides tomorrow evening was still a long way off i reminded myself that i should still have time to think about things albeit that remission of time could bring me no access of power albeit the coming event was in no way dependent upon the exercise of my will and seemed not quite inevitable only because it was still separated from me by this short interval and so it was that for a long time afterwards when i lay awake at night and revived old memories of combray i saw no more of it than this sort of luminous panel sharply defined against a vague and shadowy background like the panels which a bengal fire or some electric sign will illuminate and dissect from the front of a building the other parts of which remain plunged in darkness broad enough at its base the little parlour the dining room the alluring shadows of the path along which would come m swann the unconscious author of my sufferings the hall through which i would journey to the first step of that staircase so hard to climb which constituted all by itself the tapering 'elevation' of an irregular pyramid and at the summit my bedroom with the little passage through whose glazed door mamma would enter in a word seen always at the same evening hour isolated from all its possible surroundings detached and solitary against its shadowy background the bare minimum of scenery necessary like the setting one sees printed at the head of an old play for its performance in the provinces to the drama of my undressing as though all combray had consisted of but two floors joined by a slender staircase and as though there had been no time there but seven o'clock at night i must own that i could have assured any questioner that combray did include other scenes and did exist at other hours than these but since the facts which i should then have recalled would have been prompted only by an exercise of the will by my intellectual memory and since the pictures which that kind of memory shews us of the past preserve nothing of the past itself i should never have had any wish to ponder over this residue of combray to me it was in reality all dead permanently dead very possibly there is a large element of hazard in these matters and a second hazard that of our own death often prevents us from awaiting for any length of time the favours of the first i feel that there is much to be said for the celtic belief that the souls of those whom we have lost are held captive in some inferior being in an animal in a plant in some inanimate object and so effectively lost to us until the day which to many never comes when we happen to pass by the tree or to obtain possession of the object which forms their prison then they start and tremble they call us by our name and as soon as we have recognised their voice the spell is broken we have delivered them they have overcome death and return to share our life and so it is with our own past it is a labour in vain to attempt to recapture it all the efforts of our intellect must prove futile the past is hidden somewhere outside the realm beyond the reach of intellect in some material object in the sensation which that material object will give us which we do not suspect and as for that object it depends on chance whether we come upon it or not before we ourselves must die many years had elapsed during which nothing of combray save what was comprised in the theatre and the drama of my going to bed there had any existence for me when one day in winter as i came home my mother seeing that i was cold offered me some tea a thing i did not ordinarily take i declined at first and then for no particular reason changed my mind she sent out for one of those short plump little cakes called 'petites madeleines ' which look as though they had been moulded in the fluted scallop of a pilgrim's shell and soon mechanically weary after a dull day with the prospect of a depressing morrow i raised to my lips a spoonful of the tea in which i had soaked a morsel of the cake no sooner had the warm liquid and the crumbs with it touched my palate than a shudder ran through my whole body and i stopped intent upon the extraordinary changes that were taking place an exquisite pleasure had invaded my senses but individual detached with no suggestion of its origin and at once the vicissitudes of life had become indifferent to me its disasters innocuous its brevity illusory this new sensation having had on me the effect which love has of filling me with a precious essence or rather this essence was not in me it was myself i had ceased now to feel mediocre accidental mortal whence could it have come to me this all powerful joy i was conscious that it was connected with the taste of tea and cake but that it infinitely transcended those savours could not indeed be of the same nature as theirs whence did it come what did it signify how could i seize upon and define it i drink a second mouthful in which i find nothing more than in the first a third which gives me rather less than the second it is time to stop the potion is losing its magic it is plain that the object of my quest the truth lies not in the cup but in myself the tea has called up in me but does not itself understand and can only repeat indefinitely with a gradual loss of strength the same testimony which i too cannot interpret though i hope at least to be able to call upon the tea for it again and to find it there presently intact and at my disposal for my final enlightenment i put down my cup and examine my own mind it is for it to discover the truth but how what an abyss of uncertainty whenever the mind feels that some part of it has strayed beyond its own borders when it the seeker is at once the dark region through which it must go seeking where all its equipment will avail it nothing seek more than that create it is face to face with something which does not so far exist to which it alone can give reality and substance which it alone can bring into the light of day and i begin again to ask myself what it could have been this unremembered state which brought with it no logical proof of its existence but only the sense that it was a happy that it was a real state in whose presence other states of consciousness melted and vanished i decide to attempt to make it reappear i retrace my thoughts to the moment at which i drank the first spoonful of tea i find again the same state illumined by no fresh light i compel my mind to make one further effort to follow and recapture once again the fleeting sensation and that nothing may interrupt it in its course i shut out every obstacle every extraneous idea i stop my ears and inhibit all attention to the sounds which come from the next room and then feeling that my mind is growing fatigued without having any success to report i compel it for a change to enjoy that distraction which i have just denied it to think of other things to rest and refresh itself before the supreme attempt and then for the second time i clear an empty space in front of it i place in position before my mind's eye the still recent taste of that first mouthful and i feel something start within me something that leaves its resting place and attempts to rise something that has been embedded like an anchor at a great depth i do not know yet what it is but i can feel it mounting slowly i can measure the resistance i can hear the echo of great spaces traversed undoubtedly what is thus palpitating in the depths of my being must be the image the visual memory which being linked to that taste has tried to follow it into my conscious mind but its struggles are too far off too much confused scarcely can i perceive the colourless reflection in which are blended the uncapturable whirling medley of radiant hues and i cannot distinguish its form cannot invite it as the one possible interpreter to translate to me the evidence of its contemporary its inseparable paramour the taste of cake soaked in tea cannot ask it to inform me what special circumstance is in question of what period in my past life will it ultimately reach the clear surface of my consciousness this memory this old dead moment which the magnetism of an identical moment has travelled so far to importune to disturb to raise up out of the very depths of my being i cannot tell now that i feel nothing it has stopped has perhaps gone down again into its darkness from which who can say whether it will ever rise ten times over i must essay the task must lean down over the abyss and each time the natural laziness which deters us from every difficult enterprise every work of importance has urged me to leave the thing alone to drink my tea and to think merely of the worries of to day and of my hopes for to morrow which let themselves be pondered over without effort or distress of mind and suddenly the memory returns the taste was that of the little crumb of madeleine which on sunday mornings at combray because on those mornings i did not go out before church time when i went to say good day to her in her bedroom my aunt léonie used to give me dipping it first in her own cup of real or of lime flower tea the sight of the little madeleine had recalled nothing to my mind before i tasted it perhaps because i had so often seen such things in the interval without tasting them on the trays in pastry cooks' windows that their image had dissociated itself from those combray days to take its place among others more recent perhaps because of those memories so long abandoned and put out of mind nothing now survived everything was scattered the forms of things including that of the little scallop shell of pastry so richly sensual under its severe religious folds were either obliterated or had been so long dormant as to have lost the power of expansion which would have allowed them to resume their place in my consciousness but when from a long distant past nothing subsists after the people are dead after the things are broken and scattered still alone more fragile but with more vitality more unsubstantial more persistent more faithful the smell and taste of things remain poised a long time like souls ready to remind us waiting and hoping for their moment amid the ruins of all the rest and bear unfaltering in the tiny and almost impalpable drop of their essence the vast structure of recollection and once i had recognized the taste of the crumb of madeleine soaked in her decoction of lime flowers which my aunt used to give me although i did not yet know and must long postpone the discovery of why this memory made me so happy immediately the old grey house upon the street where her room was rose up like the scenery of a theatre to attach itself to the little pavilion opening on to the garden which had been built out behind it for my parents the isolated panel which until that moment had been all that i could see and with the house the town from morning to night and in all weathers the square where i was sent before luncheon the streets along which i used to run errands the country roads we took when it was fine and just as the japanese amuse themselves by filling a porcelain bowl with water and steeping in it little crumbs of paper which until then are without character or form but the moment they become wet stretch themselves and bend take on colour and distinctive shape become flowers or houses or people permanent and recognisable so in that moment all the flowers in our garden and in m swann's park and the water lilies on the vivonne and the good folk of the village and their little dwellings and the parish church and the whole of combray and of its surroundings taking their proper shapes and growing solid sprang into being town and gardens alike from my cup of tea combray combray at a distance from a twenty mile radius as we used to see it from the railway when we arrived there every year in holy week was no more than a church epitomising the town representing it speaking of it and for it to the horizon and as one drew near gathering close about its long dark cloak sheltering from the wind on the open plain as a shepherd gathers his sheep the woolly grey backs of its flocking houses which a fragment of its mediaeval ramparts enclosed here and there in an outline as scrupulously circular as that of a little town in a primitive painting to live in combray was a trifle depressing like its streets whose houses built of the blackened stone of the country fronted with outside steps capped with gables which projected long shadows downwards were so dark that one had as soon as the sun began to go down to draw back the curtains in the sitting room windows streets with the solemn names of saints not a few of whom figured in the history of the early lords of combray such as the rue saint hilaire the rue saint jacques in which my aunt's house stood the rue sainte hildegarde which ran past her railings and the rue du saint esprit on to which the little garden gate opened and these combray streets exist in so remote a quarter of my memory painted in colours so different from those in which the world is decked for me to day that in fact one and all of them and the church which towered above them in the square seem to me now more unsubstantial than the projections of my magic lantern while at times i feel that to be able to cross the rue saint hilaire again to engage a room in the rue de l'oiseau in the old hostelry of the oiseau flesché from whose windows in the pavement used to rise a smell of cooking which rises still in my mind now and then in the same warm gusts of comfort would be to secure a contact with the unseen world more marvellously supernatural than it would be to make golo's acquaintance and to chat with geneviève de brabant my grandfather's cousin by courtesy my great aunt with whom we used to stay was the mother of that aunt léonie who since her husband's my uncle octave's death had gradually declined to leave first combray then her house in combray then her bedroom and finally her bed and who now never 'came down ' but lay perpetually in an indefinite condition of grief physical exhaustion illness obsessions and religious observances her own room looked out over the rue saint jacques which ran a long way further to end in the grand pré as distinct from the petit pré a green space in the centre of the town where three streets met and which monotonous and grey with the three high steps of stone before almost every one of its doors seemed like a deep furrow cut by some sculptor of gothic images in the very block of stone out of which he had fashioned a calvary or a crib my aunt's life was now practically confined to two adjoining rooms in one of which she would rest in the afternoon while they aired the other they were rooms of that country order which just as in certain climes whole tracts of air or ocean are illuminated or scented by myriads of protozoa which we cannot see fascinate our sense of smell with the countless odours springing from their own special virtues wisdom habits a whole secret system of life invisible superabundant and profoundly moral which their atmosphere holds in solution smells natural enough indeed and coloured by circumstances as are those of the neighbouring countryside but already humanised domesticated confined an exquisite skilful limpid jelly blending all the fruits of the season which have left the orchard for the store room smells changing with the year but plenishing domestic smells which compensate for the sharpness of hoar frost with the sweet savour of warm bread smells lazy and punctual as a village clock roving smells pious smells rejoicing in a peace which brings only an increase of anxiety and in a prosiness which serves as a deep source of poetry to the stranger who passes through their midst without having lived amongst them the air of those rooms was saturated with the fine bouquet of a silence so nourishing so succulent that i could not enter them without a sort of greedy enjoyment particularly on those first mornings chilly still of the easter holidays when i could taste it more fully because i had just arrived then at combray before i went in to wish my aunt good day i would be kept waiting a little time in the outer room where the sun a wintry sun still had crept in to warm itself before the fire lighted already between its two brick sides and plastering all the room and everything in it with a smell of soot making the room like one of those great open hearths which one finds in the country or one of the canopied mantelpieces in old castles under which one sits hoping that in the world outside it is raining or snowing hoping almost for a catastrophic deluge to add the romance of shelter and security to the comfort of a snug retreat i would turn to and fro between the prayer desk and the stamped velvet armchairs each one always draped in its crocheted antimacassar while the fire baking like a pie the appetising smells with which the air of the room was thickly clotted which the dewy and sunny freshness of the morning had already 'raised' and started to 'set ' puffed them and glazed them and fluted them and swelled them into an invisible though not impalpable country cake an immense puff pastry in which barely waiting to savour the crustier more delicate more respectable but also drier smells of the cupboard the chest of drawers and the patterned wall paper i always returned with an unconfessed gluttony to bury myself in the nondescript resinous dull indigestible and fruity smell of the flowered quilt in the next room i could hear my aunt talking quietly to herself she never spoke save in low tones because she believed that there was something broken in her head and floating loose there which she might displace by talking too loud but she never remained for long even when alone without saying something because she believed that it was good for her throat and that by keeping the blood there in circulation it would make less frequent the chokings and other pains to which she was liable besides in the life of complete inertia which she led she attached to the least of her sensations an extraordinary importance endowed them with a protean ubiquity which made it difficult for her to keep them secret and failing a confidant to whom she might communicate them she used to promulgate them to herself in an unceasing monologue which was her sole form of activity unfortunately having formed the habit of thinking aloud she did not always take care to see that there was no one in the adjoining room and i would often hear her saying to herself i must not forget that i never slept a wink for never sleeping a wink was her great claim to distinction and one admitted and respected in our household vocabulary in the morning françoise would not 'call' her but would simply 'come to' her during the day when my aunt wished to take a nap we used to say just that she wished to 'be quiet' or to 'rest' and when in conversation she so far forgot herself as to say what made me wake up or i dreamed that she would flush and at once correct herself after waiting a minute i would go in and kiss her françoise would be making her tea or if my aunt were feeling 'upset ' she would ask instead for her 'tisane ' and it would be my duty to shake out of the chemist's little package on to a plate the amount of lime blossom required for infusion in boiling water the drying of the stems had twisted them into a fantastic trellis in whose intervals the pale flowers opened as though a painter had arranged them there grouping them in the most decorative poses the leaves which had lost or altered their own appearance assumed those instead of the most incongruous things imaginable as though the transparent wings of flies or the blank sides of labels or the petals of roses had been collected and pounded or interwoven as birds weave the material for their nests a thousand trifling little details the charming prodigality of the chemist details which would have been eliminated from an artificial preparation gave me like a book in which one is astonished to read the name of a person whom one knows the pleasure of finding that these were indeed real lime blossoms like those i had seen when coming from the train in the avenue de la gare altered but only because they were not imitations but the very same blossoms which had grown old and as each new character is merely a metamorphosis from something older in these little grey balls i recognised green buds plucked before their time but beyond all else the rosy moony tender glow which lit up the blossoms among the frail forest of stems from which they hung like little golden roses marking as the radiance upon an old wall still marks the place of a vanished fresco the difference between those parts of the tree which had and those which had not been 'in bloom' shewed me that these were petals which before their flowering time the chemist's package had embalmed on warm evenings of spring that rosy candlelight was still their colour but half extinguished and deadened in the diminished life which was now theirs and which may be called the twilight of a flower presently my aunt was able to dip in the boiling infusion in which she would relish the savour of dead or faded blossom a little madeleine of which she would hold out a piece to me when it was sufficiently soft at one side of her bed stood a big yellow chest of drawers of lemon wood and a table which served at once as pharmacy and as high altar on which beneath a statue of our lady and a bottle of vichy célestins might be found her service books and her medical prescriptions everything that she needed for the performance in bed of her duties to soul and body to keep the proper times for pepsin and for vespers on the other side her bed was bounded by the window she had the street beneath her eyes and would read in it from morning to night to divert the tedium of her life like a persian prince the daily but immemorial chronicles of combray which she would discuss in detail afterwards with françoise i would not have been five minutes with my aunt before she would send me away in case i made her tired she would hold out for me to kiss her sad brow pale and lifeless on which at this early hour she would not yet have arranged the false hair and through which the bones shone like the points of a crown of thorns or the beads of a rosary and she would say to me now my poor child you must go away go and get ready for mass and if you see françoise downstairs tell her not to stay too long amusing herself with you she must come up soon to see if i want anything françoise who had been for many years in my aunt's service and did not at that time suspect that she would one day be transferred entirely to ours was a little inclined to desert my aunt during the months which we spent in her house there had been in my infancy before we first went to combray and when my aunt léonie used still to spend the winter in paris with her mother a time when i knew françoise so little that on new year's day before going into my great aunt's house my mother put a five franc piece in my hand and said now be careful don't make any mistake wait until you hear me say 'good morning françoise ' and i touch your arm before you give it to her no sooner had we arrived in my aunt's dark hall than we saw in the gloom beneath the frills of a snowy cap as stiff and fragile as if it had been made of spun sugar the concentric waves of a smile of anticipatory gratitude it was françoise motionless and erect framed in the small doorway of the corridor like the statue of a saint in its niche when we had grown more accustomed to this religious darkness we could discern in her features a disinterested love of all humanity blended with a tender respect for the 'upper classes' which raised to the most honourable quarter of her heart the hope of receiving her due reward mamma pinched my arm sharply and said in a loud voice good morning françoise at this signal my fingers parted and i let fall the coin which found a receptacle in a confused but outstretched hand but since we had begun to go to combray there was no one i knew better than françoise we were her favourites and in the first years at least while she shewed the same consideration for us as for my aunt she enjoyed us with a keener relish because we had in addition to our dignity as part of 'the family' for she had for those invisible bonds by which community of blood unites the members of a family as much respect as any greek tragedian the fresh charm of not being her customary employers and so with what joy would she welcome us with what sorrow complain that the weather was still so bad for us on the day of our arrival just before easter when there was often an icy wind while mamma inquired after her daughter and her nephews and if her grandson was good looking and what they were going to make of him and whether he took after his granny later when no one else was in the room mamma who knew that françoise was still mourning for her parents who had been dead for years would speak of them kindly asking her endless little questions about them and their lives she had guessed that françoise was not over fond of her son in law and that he spoiled the pleasure she found in visiting her daughter as the two could not talk so freely when he was there and so one day when françoise was going to their house some miles from combray mamma said to her with a smile tell me françoise if julien has had to go away and you have marguerite to yourself all day you will be very sorry but will make the best of it won't you and françoise answered laughing madame knows everything madame is worse than the x rays she pronounced 'x' with an affectation of difficulty and with a smile in deprecation of her an unlettered woman's daring to employ a scientific term they brought here for mme octave which see what is in your heart and she went off disturbed that anyone should be caring about her perhaps anxious that we should not see her in tears mamma was the first person who had given her the pleasure of feeling that her peasant existence with its simple joys and sorrows might offer some interest might be a source of grief or pleasure to some one other than herself my aunt resigned herself to doing without françoise to some extent during our visits knowing how much my mother appreciated the services of so active and intelligent a maid one who looked as smart at five o'clock in the morning in her kitchen under a cap whose stiff and dazzling frills seemed to be made of porcelain as when dressed for churchgoing who did everything in the right way who toiled like a horse whether she was well or ill but without noise without the appearance of doing anything the only one of my aunt's maids who when mamma asked for hot water or black coffee would bring them actually boiling she was one of those servants who in a household seem least satisfactory at first to a stranger doubtless because they take no pains to make a conquest of him and shew him no special attention knowing very well that they have no real need of him that he will cease to be invited to the house sooner than they will be dismissed from it who on the other hand cling with most fidelity to those masters and mistresses who have tested and proved their real capacity and do not look for that superficial responsiveness that slavish affability which may impress a stranger favourably but often conceals an utter barrenness of spirit in which no amount of training can produce the least trace of individuality when françoise having seen that my parents had everything they required first went upstairs again to give my aunt her pepsin and to find out from her what she would take for luncheon very few mornings pased but she was called upon to give an opinion or to furnish an explanation in regard to some important event just fancy françoise mme goupil went by more than a quarter of an hour late to fetch her sister if she loses any more time on the way i should not be at all surprised if she got in after the elevation well there'd be nothing wonderful in that would be the answer or françoise if you had come in five minutes ago you would have seen mme imbert go past with some asparagus twice the size of what mother callot has do try to find out from her cook where she got them you know you've been putting asparagus in all your sauces this spring you might be able to get some like these for our visitors i shouldn't be surprised if they came from the curé's françoise would say and i'm sure you wouldn't my poor françoise my aunt would reply raising her shoulders from the curé's indeed you know quite well that he can never grow anything but wretched little twigs of asparagus not asparagus at all i tell you these ones were as thick as my arm not your arm of course but my poor arm which has grown so much thinner again this year or françoise didn't you hear that bell just now it split my head no mme octave ah poor girl your skull must be very thick you may thank god for that it was maguelone come to fetch dr piperaud he came out with her at once and they went off along the rue de l'oiseau there must be some child ill oh dear dear the poor little creature would come with a sigh from françoise who could not hear of any calamity befalling a person unknown to her even in some distant part of the world without beginning to lament or françoise for whom did they toll the passing bell just now oh dear of course it would be for mme rousseau and to think that i had forgotten that she passed away the other night indeed it is time the lord called me home too i don't know what has become of my head since i lost my poor octave but i am wasting your time my good girl indeed no mme octave my time is not so precious whoever made our time didn't sell it to us i am just going to see that my fire hasn't gone out in this way françoise and my aunt made a critical valuation between them in the course of these morning sessions of the earliest happenings of the day but sometimes these happenings assumed so mysterious or so alarming an air that my aunt felt she could not wait until it was time for françoise to come upstairs and then a formidable and quadruple peal would resound through the house but mme octave it is not time for your pepsin françoise would begin are you feeling faint no thank you françoise my aunt would reply that is to say yes for you know well that there is very seldom a time when i don't feel faint one day i shall pass away like mme rousseau before i know where i am but that is not why i rang would you believe that i have just seen as plainly as i see you mme goupil with a little girl i didn't know at all run and get a pennyworth of salt from camus it's not often that théodore can't tell you who a person is but that must be m pupin's daughter françoise would say preferring to stick to an immediate explanation since she had been perhaps twice already into camus's shop that morning m pupin's daughter oh that's a likely story my poor françoise do you think i should not have recognised m pupin's daughter but i don't mean the big one mme octave i mean the little girl he one who goes to school at jouy i seem to have seen her once already his morning oh if that's what it is my aunt would say she must have come over for the holidays yes that is it no need to ask she will have come over for the holidays but then we shall soon see mme sazerat come along and ring her sister's door bell for her luncheon that will be it i saw the boy from galopin's go by with a tart you will see that the tart was for mme goupil once mme goupil has anyone in the house mme octave you won't be long in seeing all her folk going in to their luncheon there for it's not so early as it was would be the answer for françoise who was anxious to retire downstairs to look after our own meal was not sorry to leave my aunt with the prospect of such a distraction oh not before midday my aunt would reply in a tone of resignation darting an uneasy glance at the clock but stealthily so as not to let it be seen that she who had renounced all earthly joys yet found a keen satisfaction in learning that mme goupil was expecting company to luncheon though alas she must wait a little more than an hour still before enjoying the spectacle and it will come in the middle of my luncheon she would murmur to herself her luncheon was such a distraction in itself that she did not like any other to come at the same time at least you will not forget to give me my creamed eggs on one of the flat plates these were the only plates which had pictures on them and my aunt used to amuse herself at every meal by reading the description on whichever might have been sent up to her she would put on her spectacles and spell out ali baba and the forty thieves aladdin or the wonderful lamp and smile and say very good indeed i may as well go across to camus françoise would hazard seeing that my aunt had no longer any intention of sending her there no no it's not worth while now it's certain to be the pupin girl my poor françoise i am sorry to have made you come upstairs for nothing but it was not for nothing as my aunt well knew that she had rung for françoise since at combray a person whom one 'didn't know at all' was as incredible a being as any mythological deity and it was apt to be forgotten that after each occasion on which there had appeared in the rue du saint esprit or in the square one of these bewildering phenomena careful and exhaustive researches had invariably reduced the fabulous monster to the proportions of a person whom one 'did know ' either personally or in the abstract in his or her civil status as being more or less closely related to some family in combray it would turn out to be mme sauton's son discharged from the army or the abbé perdreau's niece come home from her convent or the curé's brother a tax collector at châteaudun who had just retired on a pension or had come over to combray for the holidays on first noticing them you have been impressed by the thought that there might be in combray people whom you 'didn't know at all ' simply because you had failed to recognise or identify them at once and yet long beforehand mme sauton and the curé had given warning that they expected their 'strangers ' in the evening when i came in and went upstairs to tell my aunt the incidents of our walk if i was rash enough to say to her that we had passed near the pont vieux a man whom my grandfather didn't know a man grandfather didn't know at all she would exclaim that's a likely story none the less she would be a little disturbed by the news she would wish to have the details correctly and so my grandfather would be summoned who can it have been that you passed near the pont vieux uncle a man you didn't know at all why of course i did my grandfather would answer it was prosper mme bouilleboeuf's gardener's brother ah well my aunt would say calm again but slightly flushed still and the boy told me that you had passed a man you didn't know at all after which i would be warned to be more careful of what i said and not to upset my aunt so by thoughtless remarks everyone was so well known in combray animals as well as people that if my aunt had happened to see a dog go by which she 'didn't know at all' she would think about it incessantly devoting to the solution of the incomprehensible problem all her inductive talent and her leisure hours that will be mme sazerat's dog françoise would suggest without any real conviction but in the hope of peace and so that my aunt should not 'split her head ' as if i didn't know mme sazerat's dog for my aunt's critical mind would not so easily admit any fresh fact ah but that will be the new dog m galopin has brought her from lisieux oh if that's what it is it seems it's a most engaging animal françoise would go on having got the story from théodore as clever as a christian always in a good temper always friendly always everything that's nice it's not often you see an animal so well behaved at that age mme octave it's high time i left you i can't afford to stay here amusing myself look it's nearly ten o'clock and my fire not lighted yet and i've still to dress the asparagus what françoise more asparagus it's a regular disease of asparagus you have got this year you will make our parisians sick of it no no madame octave they like it well enough they'll be coming back from church soon as hungry as hunters and they won't eat it out of the back of their spoons you'll see church why they must be there now you'd better not lose any time go and look after your luncheon while my aunt gossiped on in this way with françoise i would have accompanied my parents to mass how i loved it how clearly i can see it still our church at combray the old porch by which we went in black and full of holes as a cullender was worn out of shape and deeply furrowed at the sides as also was the holy water stoup to which it led us just as if the gentle grazing touch of the cloaks of peasant women going into the church and of their fingers dipping into the water had managed by agelong repetition to acquire a destructive force to impress itself on the stone to carve ruts in it like those made by cart wheels upon stone gate posts against which they are driven every day its memorial stones beneath which the noble dust of the abbots of combray who were buried there furnished the choir with a sort of spiritual pavement were themselves no longer hard and lifeless matter for time had softened and sweetened them and had made them melt like honey and flow beyond their proper margins either surging out in a milky frothing wave washing from its place a florid gothic capital drowning the white violets of the marble floor or else reabsorbed into their limits contracting still further a crabbed latin inscription bringing a fresh touch of fantasy into the arrangement of its curtailed characters closing together two letters of some word of which the rest were disproportionately scattered its windows were never so brilliant as on days when the sun scarcely shone so that if it was dull outside you might be certain of fine weather in church one of them was filled from top to bottom by a solitary figure like the king on a playing card who lived up there beneath his canopy of stone between earth and heaven and in the blue light of its slanting shadow on weekdays sometimes at noon when there was no service at one of those rare moments when the airy empty church more human somehow and more luxurious with the sun shewing off all its rich furnishings seemed to have almost a habitable air like the hall all sculptured stone and painted glass of some mediaeval mansion you might see mme sazerat kneel for an instant laying down on the chair beside her own a neatly corded parcel of little cakes which she had just bought at the baker's and was taking home for her luncheon in another a mountain of rosy snow at whose foot a battle was being fought seemed to have frozen the window also which it swelled and distorted with its cloudy sleet like a pane to which snowflakes have drifted and clung but flakes illumined by a sunrise the same doubtless which purpled the reredos of the altar with tints so fresh that they seemed rather to be thrown on it for a moment by a light shining from outside and shortly to be extinguished than painted and permanently fastened on the stone and all of them were so old that you could see here and there their silvery antiquity sparkling with the dust of centuries and shewing in its threadbare brilliance the very cords of their lovely tapestry of glass there was one among them which was a tall panel composed of a hundred little rectangular windows of blue principally like a great game of patience of the kind planned to beguile king charles vi but either because a ray of sunlight had gleamed through it or because my own shifting vision had drawn across the window whose colours died away and were rekindled by turns a rare and transient fire the next instant it had taken on all the iridescence of a peacock's tail then shook and wavered in a flaming and fantastic shower distilled and dropping from the groin of the dark and rocky vault down the moist walls as though it were along the bed of some rainbow grotto of sinuous stalactites that i was following my parents who marched before me their prayer books clasped in their hands a moment later the little lozenge windows had put on the deep transparence the unbreakable hardness of sapphires clustered on some enormous breastplate but beyond which could be distinguished dearer than all such treasures a fleeting smile from the sun which could be seen and felt as well here in the blue and gentle flood in which it washed the masonry as on the pavement of the square or the straw of the market place and even on our first sundays when we came down before easter it would console me for the blackness and bareness of the earth outside by making burst into blossom as in some springtime in old history among the heirs of saint louis this dazzling and gilded carpet of forget me nots in glass two tapestries of high warp represented the coronation of esther in which tradition would have it that the weaver had given to ahasuerus the features of one of the kings of france and to esther those of a lady of guermantes whose lover he had been their colours had melted into one another so as to add expression relief light to the pictures a touch of red over the lips of esther had strayed beyond their outline the yellow on her dress was spread with such unctuous plumpness as to have acquired a kind of solidity and stood boldly out from the receding atmosphere while the green of the trees which was still bright in silk and wool among the lower parts of the panel but had quite 'gone' at the top separated in a paler scheme above the dark trunks the yellowing upper branches tanned and half obliterated by the sharp though sidelong rays of an invisible sun all these things and still more than these the treasures which had come to the church from personages who to me were almost legendary figures such as the golden cross wrought it was said by saint eloi and presented by dagobert and the tomb of the sons of louis the germanic in porphyry and enamelled copper because of which i used to go forward into the church when we were making our way to our chairs as into a fairy haunted valley where the rustic sees with amazement on a rock a tree a marsh the tangible proofs of the little people's supernatural passage all these things made of the church for me something entirely different from the rest of the town a building which occupied so to speak four dimensions of space the name of the fourth being time which had sailed the centuries with that old nave where bay after bay chapel after chapel seemed to stretch across and hold down and conquer not merely a few yards of soil but each successive epoch from which the whole building had emerged triumphant hiding the rugged barbarities of the eleventh century in the thickness of its walls through which nothing could be seen of the heavy arches long stopped and blinded with coarse blocks of ashlar except where near the porch a deep groove was furrowed into one wall by the tower stair and even there the barbarity was veiled by the graceful gothic arcade which pressed coquettishly upon it like a row of grown up sisters who to hide him from the eyes of strangers arrange themselves smilingly in front of a countrified unmannerly and ill dressed younger brother rearing into the sky above the square a tower which had looked down upon saint louis and seemed to behold him still and thrusting down with its crypt into the blackness of a merovingian night through which guiding us with groping finger tips beneath the shadowy vault ribbed strongly as an immense bat's wing of stone théodore or his sister would light up for us with a candle the tomb of sigebert's little daughter in which a deep hole like the bed of a fossil had been bored or so it was said by a crystal lamp which on the night when the frankish princess was murdered had left of its own accord the golden chains by which it was suspended where the apse is to day and with neither the crystal broken nor the light extinguished had buried itself in the stone through which it had gently forced its way and then the apse of combray what am i to say of that it was so coarse so devoid of artistic beauty even of the religious spirit from outside since the street crossing which it commanded was on a lower level its great wall was thrust upwards from a basement of unfaced ashlar jagged with flints in all of which there was nothing particularly ecclesiastical the windows seemed to have been pierced at an abnormal height and its whole appearance was that of a prison wall rather than of a church and certainly in later years were i to recall all the glorious apses that i had seen it would never enter my mind to compare with any one of them the apse of combray only one day turning out of a little street in some country town i came upon three alley ways that converged and facing them an old wall rubbed worn crumbling and unusually high with windows pierced in it far overhead and the same asymmetrical appearance as the apse of combray and at that moment i did not say to myself as at chartres i might have done or at rheims with what strength the religious feeling had been expressed in its construction but instinctively i exclaimed the church the church a dear familiar friend close pressed in the rue saint hilaire upon which its north door opened by its two neighbours mme loiseau's house and the pharmacy of m rapin against which its walls rested without interspace a simple citizen of combray who might have had her number in the street had the streets of combray borne numbers and at whose door one felt that the postman ought to stop on his morning rounds before going into mme loiseau's and after leaving m rapin's there existed for all that between the church and everything in combray that was not the church a clear line of demarcation which i have never succeeded in eliminating from my mind in vain might mme loiseau deck her window sills with fuchsias which developed the bad habit of letting their branches trail at all times and in all directions head downwards and whose flowers had no more important business when they were big enough to taste the joys of life than to go and cool their purple congested cheeks against the dark front of the church to me such conduct sanctified the fuchsias not at all between the flowers and the blackened stones towards which they leaned if my eyes could discern no interval my mind preserved the impression of an abyss from a long way off one could distinguish and identify the steeple of saint hilaire inscribing its unforgettable form upon a horizon beneath which combray had not yet appeared when from the train which brought us down from paris at easter time my father caught sight of it as it slipped into every fold of the sky in turn its little iron cock veering continually in all directions he would say come get your wraps together we are there and on one of the longest walks we ever took from combray there was a spot where the narrow road emerged suddenly on to an immense plain closed at the horizon by strips of forest over which rose and stood alone the fine point of saint hilaire's steeple but so sharpened and so pink that it seemed to be no more than sketched on the sky by the finger nail of a painter anxious to give to such a landscape to so pure a piece of 'nature ' this little sign of art this single indication of human existence as one drew near it and could make out the remains of the square tower half in ruins which still stood by its side though without rivalling it in height one was struck first of all by the tone reddish and sombre of its stones and on a misty morning in autumn one would have called it to see it rising above the violet thunder cloud of the vineyards a ruin of purple almost the colour of the wild vine often in the square as we came home my grandmother would make me stop to look up at it from the tower windows placed two and two one pair above another with that right and original proportion in their spacing to which not only human faces owe their beauty and dignity it released it let fall at regular intervals flights of jackdaws which for a little while would wheel and caw as though the ancient stones which allowed them to sport thus and never seemed to see them becoming of a sudden uninhabitable and discharging some infinitely disturbing element had struck them and driven them forth then after patterning everywhere the violet velvet of the evening air abruptly soothed they would return and be absorbed in the tower deadly no longer but benignant some perching here and there not seeming to move but snapping perhaps and swallowing some passing insect on the points of turrets as a seagull perches with an angler's immobility on the crest of a wave without quite knowing why my grandmother found in the steeple of saint hilaire that absence of vulgarity pretension and meanness which made her love and deem rich in beneficent influences nature itself when the hand of man had not as did my great aunt's gardener trimmed it and the works of genius and certainly every part one saw of the church served to distinguish the whole from any other building by a kind of general feeling which pervaded it but it was in the steeple that the church seemed to display a consciousness of itself to affirm its individual and responsible existence it was the steeple which spoke for the church i think too that in a confused way my grandmother found in the steeple of combray what she prized above anything else in the world namely a natural air and an air of distinction ignorant of architecture she would say my dears laugh at me if you like it is not conventionally beautiful but there is something in its quaint old face which pleases me if it could play the piano i am sure it would really play and when she gazed on it when her eyes followed the gentle tension the fervent inclination of its stony slopes which drew together as they rose like hands joined in prayer she would absorb herself so utterly in the outpouring of the spire that her gaze seemed to leap upwards with it her lips at the same time curving in a friendly smile for the worn old stones of which the setting sun now illumined no more than the topmost pinnacles which at the point where they entered that zone of sunlight and were softened and sweetened by it seemed to have mounted suddenly far higher to have become truly remote like a song whose singer breaks into falsetto an octave above the accompanying air it was the steeple of saint hilaire which shaped and crowned and consecrated every occupation every hour of the day every point of view in the town from my bedroom window i could discern no more than its base which had been freshly covered with slates but when on sundays i saw these in the hot light of a summer morning blaze like a black sun i would say to myself good heavens nine o'clock i must get ready for mass at once if i am to have time to go in and kiss aunt léonie first and i would know exactly what was the colour of the sunlight upon the square i could feel the heat and dust of the market the shade behind the blinds of the shop into which mamma would perhaps go on her way to mass penetrating its odour of unbleached calico to purchase a handkerchief or something of which the draper himself would let her see what he had bowing from the waist who having made everything ready for shutting up had just gone into the back shop to put on his sunday coat and to wash his hands which it was his habit every few minutes and even on the saddest occasions to rub one against the other with an air of enterprise cunning and success and again after mass when we looked in to tell théodore to bring a larger loaf than usual because our cousins had taken advantage of the fine weather to come over from thiberzy for luncheon we had in front of us the steeple which baked and brown itself like a larger loaf still of 'holy bread ' with flakes and sticky drops on it of sunlight pricked its sharp point into the blue sky and in the evening as i came in from my walk and thought of the approaching moment when i must say good night to my mother and see her no more the steeple was by contrast so kindly there at the close of day that i would imagine it as being laid like a brown velvet cushion against as being thrust into the pallid sky which had yielded beneath its pressure had sunk slightly so as to make room for it and had correspondingly risen on either side while the cries of the birds wheeling to and fro about it seemed to intensify its silence to elongate its spire still further and to invest it with some quality beyond the power of words even when our errands lay in places behind the church from which it could not be seen the view seemed always to have been composed with reference to the steeple which would stand up now here now there among the houses and was perhaps even more affecting when it appeared thus without the church and indeed there are many others which look best when seen in this way and i can call to mind vignettes of housetops with surmounting steeples in quite another category of art than those formed by the dreary streets of combray i shall never forget in a quaint norman town not far from balbec two charming eighteenth century houses dear to me and venerable for many reasons between which when one looks up at them from a fine garden which descends in terraces to the river the gothic spire of a church itself hidden by the houses soars into the sky with the effect of crowning and completing their fronts but in a material so different so precious so beringed so rosy so polished that it is at once seen to be no more a part of them than would be a part of two pretty pebbles lying side by side between which it had been washed on the beach the purple crinkled spire of some sea shell spun out into a turret and gay with glossy colour even in paris in one of the ugliest parts of the town i know a window from which one can see across a first a second and even a third layer of jumbled roofs street beyond street a violet bell sometimes ruddy sometimes too in the finest 'prints' which the atmosphere makes of it of an ashy solution of black which is in fact nothing else than the dome of saint augustin and which imparts to this view of paris the character of some of the piranesi views of rome but since into none of these little etchings whatever the taste my memory may have been able to bring to their execution was it able to contribute an element i have long lost the feeling which makes us not merely regard a thing as a spectacle but believe in it as in a creature without parallel so none of them keeps in dependence on it a whole section of my inmost life as does the memory of those aspects of the steeple of combray from the streets behind the church whether one saw it at five o'clock when going to call for letters at the post office some doors away from one on the left raising abruptly with its isolated peak the ridge of housetops or again when one had to go in and ask for news of mme sazerat one's eyes followed the line where it ran low again beyond the farther descending slope and one knew that it would be the second turning after the steeple or yet again if pressing further afield one went to the station one saw it obliquely shewing in profile fresh angles and surfaces like a solid body surprised at some unknown point in its revolution or from the banks of the vivonne the apse drawn muscularly together and heightened in perspective seemed to spring upwards with the effort which the steeple made to hurl its spire point into the heart of heaven it was always to the steeple that one must return always it which dominated everything else summing up the houses with an unexpected pinnacle raised before me like the finger of god whose body might have been concealed below among the crowd of human bodies without fear of my confounding it for that reason with them and so even to day in any large provincial town or in a quarter of paris which i do not know well if a passer by who is 'putting me on the right road' shews me from afar as a point to aim at some belfry of a hospital or a convent steeple lifting the peak of its ecclesiastical cap at the corner of the street which i am to take my memory need only find in it some dim resemblance to that dear and vanished outline and the passer by should he turn round to make sure that i have not gone astray would see me to his astonishment oblivious of the walk that i had planned to take or the place where i was obliged to call standing still on the spot before that steeple for hours on end motionless trying to remember feeling deep within myself a tract of soil reclaimed from the waters of lethe slowly drying until the buildings rise on it again and then no doubt and then more uneasily than when just now i asked him for a direction i will seek my way again i will turn a corner but the goal is in my heart on our way home from mass we would often meet m legrandin who detained in paris by his professional duties as an engineer could only except in the regular holiday seasons visit his home at combray between saturday evenings and monday mornings he was one of that class of men who apart from a scientific career in which they may well have proved brilliantly successful have acquired an entirely different kind of culture literary or artistic of which they make no use in the specialised work of their profession but by which their conversation profits more 'literary' than many 'men of letters' we were not aware at this period that m legrandin had a distinct reputation as a writer and so were greatly astonished to find that a well known composer had set some verses of his to music endowed with a greater ease in execution than many painters they imagine that the life they are obliged to lead is not that for which they are really fitted and they bring to their regular occupations either a fantastic indifference or a sustained and lofty application scornful bitter and conscientious tall with a good figure a fine thoughtful face drooping fair moustaches a look of disillusionment in his blue eyes an almost exaggerated refinement of courtesy a talker such as we had never heard he was in the sight of my family who never ceased to quote him as an example the very pattern of a gentleman who took life in the noblest and most delicate manner my grandmother alone found fault with him for speaking a little too well a little too much like a book for not using a vocabulary as natural as his loosely knotted lavallière neckties his short straight almost schoolboyish coat she was astonished too at the furious invective which he was always launching at the aristocracy at fashionable life and 'snobbishness' undoubtedly he would say the sin of which saint paul is thinking when he speaks of the sin for which there is no forgiveness worldly ambition was a thing which my grandmother was so little capable of feeling or indeed of understanding that it seemed to her futile to apply so much heat to its condemnation besides she thought it in not very good taste that m legrandin whose sister was married to a country gentleman of lower normandy near balbec should deliver himself of such violent attacks upon the nobles going so far as to blame the revolution for not having guillotined them all well met my friends he would say as he came towards us you are lucky to spend so much time here to morrow i have to go back to paris to squeeze back into my niche oh i admit he went on with his own peculiar smile gently ironical disillusioned and vague i have every useless thing in the world in my house there the only thing wanting is the necessary thing a great patch of open sky like this always try to keep a patch of sky above your life little boy he added turning to me you have a soul in you of rare quality an artist's nature never let it starve for lack of what it needs when on our reaching the house my aunt would send to ask us whether mme goupil had indeed arrived late for mass not one of us could inform her instead we increased her anxiety by telling her that there was a painter at work in the church copying the window of gilbert the bad françoise was at once dispatched to the grocer's but returned empty handed owing to the absence of théodore whose dual profession of choirman with a part in the maintenance of the fabric and of grocer's assistant gave him not only relations with all sections of society but an encyclopaedic knowledge of their affairs ah my aunt would sigh i wish it were time for eulalie to come she is really the only person who will be able to tell me eulalie was a limping energetic deaf spinster who had 'retired' after the death of mme de la bretonnerie with whom she had been in service from her childhood and had then taken a room beside the church from which she would incessantly emerge either to attend some service or when there was no service to say a prayer by herself or to give théodore a hand the rest of her time she spent in visiting sick persons like my aunt léonie to whom she would relate everything that had occurred at mass or vespers she was not above adding occasional pocket money to the little income which was found for her by the family of her old employers by going from time to time to look after the curé's linen or that of some other person of note in the clerical world of combray above a mantle of black cloth she wore a little white coif that seemed almost to attach her to some order and an infirmity of the skin had stained part of her cheeks and her crooked nose the bright red colour of balsam her visits were the one great distraction in the life of my aunt léonie who now saw hardly anyone else except the reverend curé my aunt had by degrees erased every other visitor's name from her list because they all committed the fatal error in her eyes of falling into one or other of the two categories of people she most detested one group the worse of the two and the one of which she rid herself first consisted of those who advised her not to take so much care of herself and preached even if only negatively and with no outward signs beyond an occasional disapproving silence or doubting smile the subversive doctrine that a sharp walk in the sun and a good red beefsteak would do her more good her who had had two dreadful sips of vichy water on her stomach for fourteen hours than all her medicine bottles and her bed the other category was composed of people who appeared to believe that she was more seriously ill than she thought in fact that she was as seriously ill as she said and so none of those whom she had allowed upstairs to her room after considerable hesitation and at françoise urgent request and who in the course of their visit had shewn how unworthy they were of the honour which had been done them by venturing a timid don't you think that if you were just to stir out a little on really fine days or who on the other hand when she said to them i am very low very low nearing the end dear friends had replied ah yes when one has no strength left still you may last a while yet each party alike might be certain that her doors would never open to them again and if françoise was amused by the look of consternation on my aunt's face whenever she saw from her bed any of these people in the rue du saint esprit who looked as if they were coming to see her or heard her own door bell ring she would laugh far more heartily as at a clever trick at my aunt's devices which never failed for having them sent away and at their look of discomfiture when they had to turn back without having seen her and would be filled with secret admiration for her mistress whom she felt to be superior to all these other people inasmuch as she could and did contrive not to see them in short my aunt stipulated at one and the same time that whoever came to see her must approve of her way of life commiserate with her in her sufferings and assure her of an ultimate recovery in all this eulalie excelled my aunt might say to her twenty times in a minute the end is come at last my poor eulalie twenty times eulalie would retort with knowing your illness as you do mme octave you will live to be a hundred as mme sazerin said to me only yesterday for one of eulalie's most rooted beliefs and one that the formidable list of corrections which her experience must have compiled was powerless to eradicate was that mme sazerat's name was really mme sazerin i do not ask to live to a hundred my aunt would say for she preferred to have no definite limit fixed to the number of her days and since besides this eulalie knew as no one else knew how to distract my aunt without tiring her her visits which took place regularly every sunday unless something unforeseen occurred to prevent them were for my aunt a pleasure the prospect of which kept her on those days in a state of expectation appetising enough to begin with but at once changing to the agony of a hunger too long unsatisfied if eulalie were a minute late in coming for if unduly prolonged the rapture of waiting for eulalie became a torture and my aunt would never cease from looking at the time and yawning and complaining of each of her symptoms in turn eulalie's ring if it sounded from the front door at the very end of the day when she was no longer expecting it would almost make her ill for the fact was that on sundays she thought of nothing else than this visit and the moment that our luncheon was ended françoise would become impatient for us to leave the dining room so that she might go upstairs to 'occupy' my aunt but and this more than ever from the day on which fine weather definitely set in at combray the proud hour f noon descending from the steeple of saint hilaire which it blazoned for a moment with the twelve points of its sonorous crown would long have echoed about our table beside the 'holy bread ' which too had come in after church in its familiar way and we would still be found seated in front of our arabian nights plates weighed down by the heat of the day and even more by our heavy meal for upon the permanent foundation of eggs cutlets potatoes preserves and biscuits whose appearance on the table she no longer announced to us françoise would add as the labour of fields and orchards the harvest of the tides the luck of the markets the kindness of neighbours and her own genius might provide and so effectively that our bill of fare like the quatrefoils that were carved on the porches of cathedrals in the thirteenth century reflected to some extent the march of the seasons and the incidents of human life a brill because the fish woman had guaranteed its freshness a turkey because she had seen a beauty in the market at roussainville le pin cardoons with marrow because she had never done them for us in that way before a roast leg of mutton because the fresh air made one hungry and there would be plenty of time for it to 'settle down' in the seven hours before dinner spinach by way of a change apricots because they were still hard to get gooseberries because in another fortnight there would be none left raspberries which m swann had brought specially cherries the first to come from the cherry tree which had yielded none for the last two years a cream cheese of which in those days i was extremely fond an almond cake because she had ordered one the evening before a fancy loaf because it was our turn to 'offer' the holy bread and when all these had been eaten a work composed expressly for ourselves but dedicated more particularly to my father who had a fondness for such things a cream of chocolate inspired in the mind created by the hand of françoise would be laid before us light and fleeting as an 'occasional piece' of music into which she had poured the whole of her talent anyone who refused to partake of it saying no thank you i have finished i am not hungry would at once have been lowered to the level of the philistines who when an artist makes them a present of one of his works examine its weight and material whereas what is of value is the creator's intention and his signature to have left even the tiniest morsel in the dish would have shewn as much discourtesy as to rise and leave a concert hall while the 'piece' was still being played and under the composer's very eyes at length my mother would say to me now don't stay here all day you can go up to your room if you are too hot outside but get a little fresh air first don't start reading immediately after your food and i would go and sit down beside the pump and its trough ornamented here and there like a gothic font with a salamander which modelled upon a background of crumbling stone the quick relief of its slender allegorical body on the bench without a back in the shade of a lilac tree in that little corner of the garden which communicated by a service door with the rue du saint esprit and from whose neglected soil rose in two stages an outcrop from the house itself and apparently a separate building my aunt's back kitchen one could see its red tiled floor gleaming like porphyry it seemed not so much the cave of françoise as a little temple of venus it would be overflowing with the offerings of the milkman the fruiterer the greengrocer come sometimes from distant villages to dedicate here the first fruits of their fields and its roof was always surmounted by the cooing of a dove in earlier days i would not have lingered in the sacred grove which surrounded this temple for before going upstairs to read i would steal into the little sitting room which my uncle adolphe a brother of my grandfather and an old soldier who had retired from the service as a major used to occupy on the ground floor a room which even when its opened windows let in the heat if not actually the rays of the sun which seldom penetrated so far would never fail to emit that vague and yet fresh odour suggesting at once an open air and an old fashioned kind of existence which sets and keeps the nostrils dreaming when one goes into a disused gun room but for some years now i had not gone into my uncle adolphe's room since he no longer came to combray on account of a quarrel which had arisen between him and my family by my fault and in the following circumstances once or twice every month in paris i used to be sent to pay him a visit as he was finishing his luncheon wearing a plain alpaca coat and waited upon by his servant in a working jacket of striped linen purple and white he would complain that i had not been to see him for a long time that he was being neglected he would offer me a marchpane or a tangerine and we would cross a room in which no one ever sat whose fire was never lighted whose walls were picked out with gilded mouldings its ceiling painted blue in imitation of the sky and its furniture upholstered in satin as at my grandparents' only yellow then we would enter what he called his 'study ' a room whose walls were hung with prints which shewed against a dark background a plump and rosy goddess driving a car or standing upon a globe or wearing a star on her brow pictures which were popular under the second empire because there was thought to be something about them that suggested pompeii which were then generally despised and which now people are beginning to collect again for one single and consistent reason despite any others which they may advance namely that they suggest the second empire and there i would stay with my uncle until his man came with a message from the coachman to ask him at what time he would like the carriage my uncle would then be lost in meditation while his astonished servant stood there not daring to disturb him by the least movement wondering and waiting for his answer which never varied for in the end after a supreme crisis of hesitation my uncle would utter infallibly the words a quarter past two which the servant would echo with amazement but without disputing them a quarter past two very good sir i will go and tell him at this date i was a lover of the theatre a platonic lover of necessity since my parents had not yet allowed me to enter one and so incorrect was the picture i drew for myself of the pleasures to be enjoyed there that i almost believed that each of the spectators looked as into a stereoscope upon a stage and scenery which existed for himself alone though closely resembling the thousand other spectacles presented to the rest of the audience individually every morning i would hasten to the moriss column to see what new plays it announced nothing could be more disinterested or happier than the dreams with which these announcements filled my mind dreams which took their form from the inevitable associations of the words forming the title of the play and also from the colour of the bills still damp and wrinkled with paste on which those words stood out nothing unless it were such strange titles as the testament de césar girodot or oedipe roi inscribed not on the green bills of the opéra comique but on the wine coloured bills of the comédie française nothing seemed to me to differ more profoundly from the sparkling white plume of the diamants de la couronne than the sleek mysterious satin of the domino noir and since my parents had told me that for my first visit to the theatre i should have to choose between these two pieces i would study exhaustively and in turn the title of one and the title of the other for those were all that i knew of either attempting to snatch from each a foretaste of the pleasure which it offered me and to compare this pleasure with that latent in the other title until in the end i had shewn myself such vivid such compelling pictures of on the one hand a play of dazzling arrogance and on the other a gentle velvety play that i was as little capable of deciding which play i should prefer to see as if at the dinner table they had obliged me to choose between rice à l'impératrice and the famous cream of chocolate all my conversations with my playfellows bore upon actors whose art although as yet i had no experience of it was the first of all its numberless forms in which art itself allowed me to anticipate its enjoyment between one actor's tricks of intonation and inflection and another's the most trifling differences would strike me as being of an incalculable importance and from what i had been told of them i would arrange them in the order of their talent in lists which i used to murmur to myself all day long lists which in the end became petrified in my brain and were a source of annoyance to it being irremovable and later in my schooldays whenever i ventured in class when the master's head was turned to communicate with some new friend i would always begin by asking him whether he had begun yet to go to theatres and if he agreed that our greatest actor was undoubtedly got our second delaunay and so on and if in his judgment febvre came below thiron or delaunay below coquelin the sudden volatility which the name of coquelin forsaking its stony rigidity would engender in my mind in which it moved upwards to the second place the rich vitality with which the name of delaunay would suddenly be furnished to enable it to slip down to fourth would stimulate and fertilise my brain with a sense of bradding and blossoming life but if the thought of actors weighed so upon me if the sight of maubant coming out one afternoon from the théâtre français had plunged me in the throes and sufferings of hopeless love how much more did the name of a 'star ' blazing outside the doors of a theatre how much more seen through the window of a brougham which passed me in the street the hair over her forehead abloom with roses did the face of a woman who i would think was perhaps an actress leave with me a lasting disturbance a futile and painful effort to form a picture of her private life i classified in order of talent the most distinguished sarah bernhardt berma bartet madeleine brohan jeanne samary but i was interested in them all now my uncle knew many of them personally and also ladies of another class not clearly distinguished from actresses in my mind he used to entertain them at his house and if we went to see him on certain days only that was because on the other days ladies might come whom his family could not very well have met so we at least thought as for my uncle his fatal readiness to pay pretty widows who had perhaps never been married and countesses whose high sounding titles were probably no more than noms de guerre the compliment of presenting them to my grandmother or even of presenting to them some of our family jewels had already embroiled him more than once with my grandfather often if the name of some actress were mentioned in conversation i would hear my father say with a smile to my mother one of your uncle's friends and i would think of the weary novitiate through which perhaps for years on end a grown man even a man of real importance might have to pass waiting on the doorstep of some such lady while she refused to answer his letters and made her hall porter drive him away and imagine that my uncle was able to dispense a little jackanapes like myself from all these sufferings by introducing me in his own home to the actress unapproachable by all the world but for him an intimate friend and so on the pretext that some lesson the hour of which had been altered now came at such an awkward time that it had already more than once prevented me and would continue to prevent me from seeing my uncle one day not one of the days which he set apart for our visits i took advantage of the fact that my parents had had luncheon earlier than usual i slipped out and instead of going to read the playbills on their column for which purpose i was allowed to go out unaccompanied i ran all the way to his house i noticed before his door a carriage and pair with red carnations on the horses' blinkers and in the coachman's buttonhole as i climbed the staircase i could hear laughter and a woman's voice and as soon as i had rung silence and the sound of shutting doors the man servant who let me in appeared embarrassed and said that my uncle was extremely busy and probably could not see me he went in however to announce my arrival and the same voice i had heard before said oh yes do let him come in just for a moment it will be so amusing is that his photograph there on your desk and his mother your niece isn't she beside it the image of her isn't he i should so like to see the little chap just for a second i could hear my uncle grumbling and growing angry finally the manservant told me to come in on the table was the same plate of marchpanes that was always there my uncle wore the same alpaca coat as on other days but opposite to him in a pink silk dress with a great necklace of pearls about her throat sat a young woman who was just finishing a tangerine my uncertainty whether i ought to address her as madame or mademoiselle made me blush and not daring to look too much in her direction in case i should be obliged to speak to her i hurried across to kiss my uncle she looked at me and smiled my uncle said my nephew without telling her my name or telling me hers doubtless because since his difficulties with my grandfather he had endeavoured as far as possible to avoid any association of his family with this other class of acquaintance how like his mother he is said the lady but you have never seen my niece except in photographs my uncle broke in quickly with a note of anger i beg your pardon dear friend i passed her on the staircase last year when you were so ill it is true i only saw her for a moment and your staircase is rather dark but i saw well enough to see how lovely she was this young gentleman has her beautiful eyes and also this she went on tracing a line with one finger across the lower part of her forehead tell me she asked my uncle is your niece mme is her name the same as yours he takes most after his father muttered my uncle who was no more anxious to effect an introduction by proxy in repeating mamma's name aloud than to bring the two together in the flesh he's his father all over and also like my poor mother i have not met his father dear said the lady in pink bowing her head slightly and i never saw your poor mother you will remember it was just after your great sorrow that we got to know one another i felt somewhat disillusioned for this young lady was in no way different from other pretty women whom i had seen from time to time at home especially the daughter of one of our cousins to whose house i went every new year's day only better dressed otherwise my uncle's friend had the same quick and kindly glance the same frank and friendly manner i could find no trace in her of the theatrical appearance which i admired in photographs of actresses nothing of the diabolical expression which would have been in keeping with the life she must lead i had difficulty in believing that this was one of 'those women ' and certainly i should never have believed her one of the 'smart ones' had i not seen the carriage and pair the pink dress the pearly necklace had i not been aware too that my uncle knew only the very best of them but i asked myself how the millionaire who gave her her carriage and her flat and her jewels could find any pleasure in flinging his money away upon a woman who had so simple and respectable an appearance and yet when i thought of what her life must be like its immorality disturbed me more perhaps than if it had stood before me in some concrete and recognisable form by its secrecy and invisibility like the plot of a novel the hidden truth of a scandal which had driven out of the home of her middle class parents and dedicated to the service of all mankind which had brought to the flowering point of her beauty had raised to fame or notoriety this woman the play of whose features the intonations of whose voice like so many others i already knew made me regard her in spite of myself as a young lady of good family her who was no longer of a family at all we had gone by this time into the 'study ' and my uncle who seemed a trifle embarrassed by my presence offered her a cigarette no thank you dear friend she said you know i only smoke the ones the grand duke sends me i tell him that they make you jealous and she drew from a case cigarettes covered with inscriptions in gold in a foreign language why yes she began again suddenly of course i have met this young man's father with you isn't he your nephew how on earth could i have forgotten he was so nice so charming to me she went on modestly and with feeling but when i thought to myself what must actually have been the rude greeting which she made out had been so charming i who knew my father's coldness and reserve was shocked as though at some indelicacy on his part at the contrast between the excessive recognition bestowed on it and his never adequate geniality it has since struck me as one of the most touching aspects of the part played in life by these idle painstaking women that they devote all their generosity all their talent their transferable dreams of sentimental beauty for like all artists they never seek to realise the value of those dreams or to enclose them in the four square frame of everyday life and their gold which counts for little to the fashioning of a fine and precious setting for the rubbed and scratched and ill polished lives of men and just as this one filled the smoking room where my uncle was entertaining her in his alpaca coat with her charming person her dress of pink silk her pearls and the refinement suggested by intimacy with a grand duke so in the same way she had taken some casual remark by my father had worked it up delicately given it a 'turn ' a precious title set in it the gem of a glance from her own eyes a gem of the first water blended of humility and gratitude and so had given it back transformed into a jewel a work of art into something altogether charming look here my boy it is time you went away said my uncle i rose i could scarcely resist a desire to kiss the hand of the lady in pink but i felt that to do so would require as much audacity as a forcible abduction of her my heart beat loud while i counted out to myself shall i do it shall i not and then i ceased to ask myself what i ought to do so as at least to do something blindly hotly madly flinging aside all the reasons i had just found to support such action i seized and raised to my lips the hand she held out to me isn't he delicious quite a ladies' man already he takes after his uncle he'll be a perfect 'gentleman ' she went on setting her teeth so as to give the word a kind of english accentuation couldn't he come to me some day for 'a cup of tea ' as our friends across the channel say he need only send me a 'blue' in the morning i had not the least idea of what a 'blue' might be i did not understand half the words which the lady used but my fear lest there should be concealed in them some question which it would be impolite in me not to answer kept me from withdrawing my close attention from them and i was beginning to feel extremely tired no no it is impossible said my uncle shrugging his shoulders he is kept busy at home all day he has plenty of work to do he brings back all the prizes from his school he added in a lower tone so that i should not hear this falsehood and interrupt with a contradiction you can't tell he may turn out a little victor hugo a kind of vaulabelle don't you know oh i love artistic people replied the lady in pink there is no one like them for understanding women them and really nice men like yourself but please forgive my ignorance who what is vaulabelle is it those gilt books in the little glass case in your drawing room you know you promised to lend them to me i will take great care of them my uncle who hated lending people books said nothing and ushered me out into the hall madly in love with the lady in pink i covered my old uncle's tobacco stained cheeks with passionate kisses and while he awkwardly enough gave me to understand without actually saying that he would rather i did not tell my parents about this visit i assured him with tears in my eyes that his kindness had made so strong an impression upon me that some day i would most certainly find a way of expressing my gratitude so strong an impression had it made upon me that two hours later after a string of mysterious utterances which did not strike me as giving my parents a sufficiently clear idea of the new importance with which i had been invested i found it simpler to let them have a full account omitting no detail of the visit i had paid that afternoon in doing this i had no thought of causing my uncle any unpleasantness how could i have thought such a thing since i did not wish it and i could not suppose that my parents would see any harm in a visit in which i myself saw none every day of our lives does not some friend or other ask us to make his apologies without fail to some woman to whom he has been prevented from writing and do not we forget to do so feeling that this woman cannot attach much importance to a silence which has none for ourselves i imagined like everyone else that the brains of other people were lifeless and submissive receptacles with no power of specific reaction to any stimulus which might be applied to them and i had not the least doubt that when i deposited in the minds of my parents the news of the acquaintance i had made at my uncle's i should at the same time transmit to them the kindly judgment i myself had based on the introduction unfortunately my parents had recourse to principles entirely different from those which i suggested they should adopt when they came to form their estimate of my uncle's conduct my father and grandfather had 'words' with him of a violent order as i learned indirectly a few days later passing my uncle in the street as he drove by in an open carriage î felt at once all the grief the gratitude the remorse which i should have liked to convey to him beside the immensity of these emotions i considered that merely to raise my hat to him would be incongruous and petty and might make him think that i regarded myself as bound to shew him no more than the commonest form of courtesy i decided to abstain from so inadequate a gesture and turned my head away my uncle thought that in doing so i was obeying my parents' orders he never forgave them and though he did not die until many years later not one of us ever set eyes on him again and so i no longer used to go into the little sitting room now kept shut of my uncle adolphe instead after hanging about on the outskirts of the back kitchen until françoise appeared on its threshold and announced i am going to let the kitchen maid serve the coffee and take up the hot water it is time i went off to mme octave i would then decide to go indoors and would go straight upstairs to my room to read the kitchen maid was an abstract personality a permanent institution to which an invariable set of attributes assured a sort of fixity and continuity and identity throughout the long series of transitory human shapes in which that personality was incarnate for we never found the same girl there two years running in the year in which we ate such quantities of asparagus the kitchen maid whose duty it was to dress them was a poor sickly creature some way 'gone' in pregnancy when we arrived at combray for easter and it was indeed surprising that françoise allowed her to run so many errands in the town and to do so much work in the house for she was beginning to find a difficulty in bearing before her the mysterious casket fuller and larger every day whose splendid outline could be detected through the folds of her ample smocks these last recalled the cloaks in which giotto shrouds some of the allegorical figures in his paintings of which m swann had given me photographs he it was who pointed out the resemblance and when he inquired after the kitchen maid he would say well how goes it with giotto's charity and indeed the poor girl whose pregnancy had swelled and stoutened every part of her even to her face and the vertical squared outlines of her cheeks did distinctly suggest those virgins so strong and mannish as to seem matrons rather in whom the virtues are personified in the arena chapel and i can see now that those virtues and vices of padua resembled her in another respect as well for just as the figure of this girl had been enlarged by the additional symbol which she carried in her body without appearing to understand what it meant without any rendering in her facial expression of all its beauty and spiritual significance but carried as if it were an ordinary and rather heavy burden so it is without any apparent suspicion of what she is about that the powerfully built housewife who is portrayed in the arena beneath the label 'caritas ' and a reproduction of whose portrait hung upon the wall of my schoolroom at combray incarnates that virtue for it seems impossible that any thought of charity can ever have found expression in her vulgar and energetic face by a fine stroke of the painter's invention she is tumbling all the treasures of the earth at her feet but exactly as if she were treading grapes in a wine press to extract their juice or still more as if she had climbed on a heap of sacks to raise herself higher and she is holding out her flaming heart to god or shall we say 'handing' it to him exactly as a cook might hand up a corkscrew through the skylight of her underground kitchen to some one who had called down to ask her for it from the ground level above the 'invidia ' again should have had some look on her face of envy but in this fresco too the symbol occupies so large a place and is represented with such realism the serpent hissing between the lips of envy is so huge and so completely fills her wide opened mouth that the muscles of her face are strained and contorted like a child's who is filling a balloon with his breath and that envy and we ourselves for that matter when we look at her since all her attention and ours are concentrated on the action of her lips have no time almost to spare for envious thoughts despite all the admiration that m swann might profess for these figures of giotto it was a long time before i could find any pleasure in seeing in our schoolroom where the copies he had brought me were hung that charity devoid of charity that envy who looked like nothing so much as a plate in some medical book illustrating the compression of the glottis or uvula by a tumour in the tongue or by the introduction of the operator's instrument a justice whose greyish and meanly regular features were the very same as those which adorned the faces of certain good and pious and slightly withered ladies of combray whom i used to see at mass many of whom had long been enrolled in the reserve forces of injustice but in later years i understood that the arresting strangeness the special beauty of these frescoes lay in the great part played in each of them by its symbols while the fact that these were depicted not as symbols for the thought symbolised was nowhere expressed but as real things actually felt or materially handled added something more precise and more literal to their meaning something more concrete and more striking to the lesson they imparted and even in the case of the poor kitchen maid was not our attention incessantly drawn to her belly by the load which filled it and in the same way again are not the thoughts of men and women in the agony of death often turned towards the practical painful obscure internal intestinal aspect towards that 'seamy side' of death which is as it happens the side that death actually presents to them and forces them to feel a side which far more closely resembles a crushing burden a difficulty in breathing a destroying thirst than the abstract idea to which we are accustomed to give the name of death there must have been a strong element of reality in those virtues and vices of padua since they appeared to me to be as much alive as the pregnant servant girl while she herself appeared scarcely less allegorical than they and quite possibly this lack or seeming lack of participation by a person's soul in the significant marks of its own special virtue has apart from its aesthetic meaning a reality which if not strictly psychological may at least be called physiognomical later on when in the course of my life i have had occasion to meet with in convents for instance literally saintly examples of practical charity they have generally had the brisk decided undisturbed and slightly brutal air of a busy surgeon the face in which one can discern no commiseration no tenderness at the sight of suffering humanity and no fear of hurting it the face devoid of gentleness or sympathy the sublime face of true goodness then while the kitchen maid who all unawares made the superior qualities of françoise shine with added lustre just as error by force of contrast enhances the triumph of truth took in coffee which according to mamma was nothing more than hot water and then carried up to our rooms hot water which was barely tepid i would be lying stretched out on my bed a book in my hand in my room which trembled with the effort to defend its frail transparent coolness against the afternoon sun behind its almost closed shutters through which however a reflection of the sunlight had contrived to slip in on its golden wings remaining motionless between glass and woodwork in a corner like a butterfly poised upon a flower it was hardly light enough for me to read and my feeling of the day's brightness and splendour was derived solely from the blows struck down below in the rue de la curé by camus whom françoise had assured that my aunt was not 'resting' and that he might therefore make a noise upon some old packing cases from which nothing would really be sent flying but the dust though the din of them in the resonant atmosphere that accompanies hot weather seemed to scatter broadcast a rain of blood red stars and from the flies who performed for my benefit in their small concert as it might be the chamber music of summer evoking heat and light quite differently from an air of human music which if you happen to have heard it during a fine summer will always bring that summer back to your mind the flies' music is bound to the season by a closer a more vital tie born of sunny days and not to be reborn but with them containing something of their essential nature it not merely calls up their image in our memory but gives us a guarantee that they do really exist that they are close around us immediately accessible this dim freshness of my room was to the broad daylight of the street what the shadow is to the sunbeam that is to say equally luminous and presented to my imagination the entire panorama of summer which my senses if i had been out walking could have tasted and enjoyed in fragments only and so was quite in harmony with my state of repose which thanks to the adventures related in my books which had just excited it bore like a hand reposing motionless in a stream of running water the shock and animation of a torrent of activity and life but my grandmother even if the weather after growing too hot had broken and a storm or just a shower had burst over us would come up and beg me to go outside and as i did not wish to leave off my book i would go on with it in the garden under the chestnut tree in a little sentry box of canvas and matting in the farthest recesses of which i used to sit and feel that i was hidden from the eyes of anyone who might be coming to call upon the family and then my thoughts did not they form a similar sort of hiding hole in the depths of which i felt that i could bury myself and remain invisible even when i was looking at what went on outside when i saw any external object my consciousness that i was seeing it would remain between me and it enclosing it in a slender incorporeal outline which prevented me from ever coming directly in contact with the material form for it would volatilise itself in some way before i could touch it just as an incandescent body which is moved towards something wet never actually touches moisture since it is always preceded itself by a zone of evaporation upon the sort of screen patterned with different states and impressions which my consciousness would quietly unfold while i was reading and which ranged from the most deeply hidden aspirations of my heart to the wholly external view of the horizon spread out before my eyes at the foot of the garden what was from the first the most permanent and the most intimate part of me the lever whose incessant movements controlled all the rest was my belief in the philosophic richness and beauty of the book i was reading and my desire to appropriate these to myself whatever the book might be for even if i had purchased it at combray having seen it outside borange's whose grocery lay too far from our house for françoise to be able to deal there as she did with camus but who enjoyed better custom as a stationer and bookseller even if i had seen it tied with string to keep it in its place in the mosaic of monthly parts and pamphlets which adorned either side of his doorway a doorway more mysterious more teeming with suggestion than that of a cathedral i should have noticed and bought it there simply because i had recognised it as a book which had been well spoken of in my hearing by the school master or the school friend who at that particular time seemed to me to be entrusted with the secret of truth and beauty things half felt by me half incomprehensible the full understanding of which was the vague but permanent object of my thoughts next to this central belief which while i was reading would be constantly a motion from my inner self to the outer world towards the discovery of truth came the emotions aroused in me by the action in which i would be taking part for these afternoons were crammed with more dramatic and sensational events than occur often in a whole lifetime these were the events which took place in the book i was reading it is true that the people concerned in them were not what françoise would have called 'real people ' but none of the feelings which the joys or misfortunes of a 'real' person awaken in us can be awakened except through a mental picture of those joys or misfortunes and the ingenuity of the first novelist lay in his understanding that as the picture was the one essential element in the complicated structure of our emotions so that simplification of it which consisted in the suppression pure and simple of 'real' people would be a decided improvement a 'real' person profoundly as we may sympathise with him is in a great measure perceptible only through our senses that is to say he remains opaque offers a dead weight which our sensibilities have not the strength to lift if some misfortune comes to him it is only in one small section of the complete idea we have of him that we are capable of feeling any emotion indeed it is only in one small section of the complete idea he has of himself that he is capable of feeling any emotion either the novelist's happy discovery was to think of substituting for those opaque sections impenetrable by the human spirit their equivalent in immaterial sections things that is which the spirit can assimilate to itself after which it matters not that the actions the feelings of this new order of creatures appear to us in the guise of truth since we have made them our own since it is in ourselves that they are happening that they are holding in thrall while we turn over feverishly the pages of the book our quickened breath and staring eyes and once the novelist has brought us to that state in which as in all purely mental states every emotion is multiplied ten fold into which his book comes to disturb us as might a dream but a dream more lucid and of a more lasting impression than those which come to us in sleep why then for the space of an hour he sets free within us all the joys and sorrows in the world a few of which only we should have to spend years of our actual life in getting to know and the keenest the most intense of which would never have been revealed to us because the slow course of their development stops our perception of them it is the same in life the heart changes and that is our worst misfortune but we learn of it only from reading or by imagination for in reality its alteration like that of certain natural phenomena is so gradual that even if we are able to distinguish successively each of its different states we are still spared the actual sensation of change next to but distinctly less intimate a part of myself than this human element would come the view more or less projected before my eyes of the country in which the action of the story was taking place which made a far stronger impression on my mind than the other the actual landscape which would meet my eyes when i raised them from my book in this way for two consecutive summers i used to sit in the heat of our combray garden sick with a longing inspired by the book i was then reading for a land of mountains and rivers where i could see an endless vista of sawmills where beneath the limpid currents fragments of wood lay mouldering in beds of watercress and nearby rambling and clustering along low walls purple flowers and red and since there was always lurking in my mind the dream of a woman who would enrich me with her love that dream in those two summers used to be quickened with the freshness and coolness of running water and whoever she might be the woman whose image i called to mind purple flowers and red would at once spring up on either side of her like complementary colours this was not only because an image of which we dream remains for ever distinguished is adorned and enriched by the association of colours not its own which may happen to surround it in our mental picture for the scenes in the books i read were to me not merely scenery more vividly portrayed by my imagination than any which combray could spread before my eyes but otherwise of the same kind because of the selection that the author had made of them because of the spirit of faith in which my mind would exceed and anticipate his printed word as it might be interpreting a revelation these scenes used to give me the impression one which i hardly ever derived from any place in which i might happen to be and never from our garden that undistinguished product of the strictly conventional fantasy of the gardener whom my grandmother so despised of their being actually part of nature herself and worthy to be studied and explored had my parents allowed me when i read a book to pay a visit to the country it described i should have felt that i was making an enormous advance towards the ultimate conquest of truth for even if we have the sensation of being always enveloped in surrounded by our own soul still it does not seem a fixed and immovable prison rather do we seem to be borne away with it and perpetually struggling to pass beyond it to break out into the world with a perpetual discouragement as we hear endlessly all around us that unvarying sound which is no echo from without but the resonance of a vibration from within we try to discover in things endeared to us on that account the spiritual glamour which we ourselves have cast upon them we are disillusioned and learn that they are in themselves barren and devoid of the charm which they owed in our minds to the association of certain ideas sometimes we mobilise all our spiritual forces in a glittering array so as to influence and subjugate other human beings who as we very well know are situated outside ourselves where we can never reach them and so if i always imagined the woman i loved as in a setting of whatever places i most longed at the time to visit if in my secret longings it was she who attracted me to them who opened to me the gate of an unknown world that was not by the mere hazard of a simple association of thoughts no it was because my dreams of travel and of love were only moments which i isolate artificially to day as though i were cutting sections at different heights in a jet of water rainbow flashing but seemingly without flow or motion were only drops in a single undeviating irresistible outrush of all the forces of my life and then as i continue to trace the outward course of these impressions from their close packed intimate source in my consciousness and before i come to the horizon of reality which envelops them i discover pleasures of another kind those of being comfortably seated of tasting the good scent on the air of not being disturbed by any visitor and when an hour chimed from the steeple of saint hilaire of watching what was already spent of the afternoon fall drop by drop until i heard the last stroke which enabled me to add up the total sum after which the silence that followed seemed to herald the beginning in the blue sky above me of that long part of the day still allowed me for reading until the good dinner which françoise was even now preparing should come to strengthen and refresh me after the strenuous pursuit of its hero through the pages of my book and as each hour struck it would seem to me that a few seconds only had passed since the hour before the latest would inscribe itself close to its predecessor on the sky's surface and i would be unable to believe that sixty minutes could be squeezed into the tiny arc of blue which was comprised between their two golden figures sometimes it would even happen that this precocious hour would sound two strokes more than the last there must then have been an hour which i had not heard strike something which had taken place had not taken place for me the fascination of my book a magic as potent as the deepest slumber had stopped my enchanted ears and had obliterated the sound of that golden bell from the azure surface of the enveloping silence sweet sunday afternoons beneath the chestnut tree in our combray garden from which i was careful to eliminate every commonplace incident of my actual life replacing them by a career of strange adventures and ambitions in a land watered by living streams you still recall those adventures and ambitions to my mind when i think of you and you embody and preserve them by virtue of having little by little drawn round and enclosed them while i went on with my book and the heat of the day declined in the gradual crystallisation slowly altering in form and dappled with a pattern of chestnut leaves of your silent sonorous fragrant limpid hours sometimes i would be torn from my book in the middle of the afternoon by the gardener's daughter who came running like a mad thing overturning an orange tree in its tub cutting a finger breaking a tooth and screaming out they're coming they're coming so that françoise and i should run too and not miss anything of the show that was on days when the cavalry stationed in combray went out for some military exercise going as a rule by the rue sainte hildegarde while our servants sitting in a row on their chairs outside the garden railings stared at the people of combray taking their sunday walks and were stared at in return the gardener's daughter through the gap which there was between two houses far away in the avenue de la gare would have spied the glitter of helmets the servants then hurried in with their chairs for when the troopers filed through the rue sainte hildegarde they filled it from side to side and their jostling horses scraped against the walls of the houses covering and drowning the pavements like banks which present too narrow a channel to a river in flood poor children françoise would exclaim in tears almost before she had reached the railings poor boys to be mown down like grass in a meadow it's just shocking to think of she would go on laying a hand over her heart where presumably she had felt the shock a fine sight isn't it mme françoise all these young fellows not caring two straws for their lives the gardener would ask just to 'draw' her and he would not have spoken in vain not caring for their lives is it why what in the world is there that we should care for if it's not our lives the only gift the lord never offers us a second time oh dear oh dear you're right all the same it's quite true they don't care i can remember them in '70 in those wretched wars they've no fear of death left in them they're nothing more nor less than madmen and then they aren't worth the price of a rope to hang them with they're not men any more they're lions for by her way of thinking to compare a man with a lion which she used to pronounce 'lie on ' was not at all complimentary to the man the rue sainte hildegarde turned too sharply for us to be able to see people approaching at any distance and it was only through the gap between those two houses in the avenue de la gare that we could still make out fresh helmets racing along towards us and flashing in the sunlight the gardener wanted to know whether there were still many to come and he was thirsty besides with the sun beating down upon his head so then suddenly his daughter would leap out as though from a beleaguered city would make a sortie turn the street corner and having risked her life a hundred times over reappear and bring us with a jug of liquorice water the news that there were still at least a thousand of them pouring along without a break from the direction of thiberzy and méséglise françoise and the gardener having 'made up' their difference would discuss the line to be followed in case of war don't you see françoise he would say revolution would be better because then no one would need to join in unless he liked oh yes i can see that certainly it's more straightforward the gardener believed that as soon as war was declared they would stop all the railways yes to be sure so that we sha'n't get away said françoise and the gardener would assent with ay they're the cunning ones for he would not allow that war was anything but a kind of trick which the state attempted to play on the people or that there was a man in the world who would not run away from it if he had the chance to do so but françoise would hasten back to my aunt and i would return to my book and the servants would take their places again outside the gate to watch the dust settle on the pavement and the excitement caused by the passage of the soldiers subside long after order had been restored an abnormal tide of humanity would continue to darken the streets of cormbray and in front of every house even of those where it was not as a rule 'done ' the servants and sometimes even the masters would sit and stare festooning their doorsteps with a dark irregular fringe like the border of shells and sea weed which a stronger tide than usual leaves on the beach as though trimming it with embroidered crape when the sea itself has retreated except on such days as these however i would as a rule be left to read in peace but the interruption which a visit from swann once made and the commentary which he then supplied to the course of my reading which had brought me to the work of an author quite new to me called bergotte had this definite result that for a long time afterwards it was not against a wall gay with spikes of purple blossom but on a wholly different background the porch of a gothic cathedral that i would see outlined the figure of one of the women of whom i dreamed i had heard bergotte spoken of for the first time by a friend older than myself for whom i had a strong admiration a precious youth of the name of bloch hearing me confess my love of the nuit d'octobre he had burst out in a bray of laughter like a bugle call and told me by way of warning you must conquer your vile taste for a de musset esquire he is a bad egg one of the very worst a pretty detestable specimen i am bound to admit natheless he added graciously that he and even the man racine did each of them once in his life compose a line which is not only fairly rhythmical but has also what is in my eyes the supreme merit of meaning absolutely nothing one is la blanche oloossone et la blanche camire and the other la fille de minos et de pasiphaë they were submitted to my judgment as evidence for the defence of the two runagates in an article by my very dear master father lecomte who is found pleasing in the sight of the immortal gods by which token here is a book which i have not the time just now to read a book recommended it would seem by that colossal fellow he regards or so they tell me its author one bergotte esquire as a subtle scribe more subtle indeed than any beast of the field and albeit he exhibits on occasion a critical pacifism a tenderness in suffering fools for which it is impossible to account and hard to make allowance still his word has weight with me as it were the delphic oracle read you then this lyrical prose and if the titanic master builder of rhythm who composed bhagavat and the lévrier de magnus speaks not falsely then by apollo you may taste even you my master the ambrosial joys of olympus it was in an ostensible vein of sarcasm that he had asked me to call him and that he himself called me my master but as a matter of fact we each derived a certain amount of satisfaction from the mannerism being still at the age in which one believes that one gives a thing real existence by giving it a name unfortunately i was not able to set at rest by further talks with bloch in which i might have insisted upon an explanation the doubts he had engendered in me when he told me that fine lines of poetry from which i if you please expected nothing less than the revelation of truth itself were all the finer if they meant absolutely nothing for as it happened bloch was not invited to the house again at first he had been well received there it is true that my grandfather made out that whenever i formed a strong attachment to any one of my friends and brought him home with me that friend was invariably a jew to which he would not have objected on principle indeed his own friend swann was of jewish extraction had he not found that the jews whom i chose as friends were not usually of the best type and so i was hardly ever able to bring a new friend home without my grandfather's humming the o god of our fathers from la juive or else israel break thy chain singing the tune alone of course to an um ti tum ti tum tra la but i used to be afraid of my friend's recognising the sound and so being able to reconstruct the words before seeing them merely on hearing their names about which as often as not there was nothing particularly hebraic he would divine not only the jewish origin of such of my friends as might indeed be of the chosen people but even some dark secret which was hidden in their family and what do they call your friend who is coming this evening dumont grandpapa dumont oh i'm frightened of dumont and he would sing archers be on your guard watch without rest without sound and then after a few adroit questions on points of detail he would call out on guard on guard or if it were the victim himself who had already arrived and had been obliged unconsciously by my grandfather's subtle examination to admit his origin then my grandfather to shew us that he had no longer any doubts would merely look at us humming almost inaudibly the air of what do you hither guide the feet of this timid israelite or of sweet vale of hebron dear paternal fields or perhaps of yes i am of the chosen race these little eccentricities on my grandfather's part implied no ill will whatsoever towards my friends but bloch had displeased my family for other reasons he had begun by annoying my father who seeing him come in with wet clothes had asked him with keen interest why m bloch is there a change in the weather has it been raining i can't understand it the barometer has been 'set fair ' which drew from bloch nothing more instructive than sir i am absolutely incapable of telling you whether it has rained i live so resolutely apart from physical contingencies that my senses no longer trouble to inform me of them my poor boy said my father after bloch had gone your friend is out of his mind why he couldn't even tell me what the weather was like as if there could be anything more interesting he is an imbecile next bloch had displeased my grandmother because after luncheon when she complained of not feeling very well he had stifled a sob and wiped the tears from his eyes you cannot imagine that he is sincere she observed to me why he doesn't know me unless he's mad of course and finally he had upset the whole household when he arrived an hour and a half late for luncheon and covered with mud from head to foot and made not the least apology saying merely i never allow myself to be influenced in the smallest degree either by atmospheric disturbances or by the arbitrary divisions of what is known as time i would willingly reintroduce to society the opium pipe of china or the malayan kriss but i am wholly and entirely without instruction in those infinitely more pernicious besides being quite bleakly bourgeois implements the umbrella and the watch in spite of all this he would still have been received at combray he was of course hardly the friend my parents would have chosen for me they had in the end decided that the tears which he had shed on hearing of my grandmother's illness were genuine enough but they knew either instinctively or from their own experience that our early impulsive emotions have but little influence over our later actions and the conduct of our lives and that regard for moral obligations loyalty to our friends patience in finishing our work obedience to a rule of life have a surer foundation in habits solidly formed and blindly followed than in these momentary transports ardent but sterile they would have preferred to bloch as companions for myself boys who would have given me no more than it is proper by all the laws of middle class morality for boys to give one another who would not unexpectedly send me a basket of fruit because they happened that morning to have thought of me with affection but who since they were incapable of inclining in my favour by any single impulse of their imagination and emotions the exact balance of the duties and claims of friendship were as incapable of loading the scales to my prejudice even the injuries we do them will not easily divert from the path of their duty towards us those conventional natures of which my great aunt furnished a type who after quarrelling for years with a niece to whom she never spoke again yet made no change in the will in which she had left that niece the whole of her fortune because she was her next of kin and it was the 'proper thing' to do but i was fond of bloch my parents wished me to be happy and the insoluble problems which i set myself on such texts as the 'absolutely meaningless' beauty of la fille de minos et de pasiphaë tired me more and made me more unwell than i should have been after further talks with him unwholesome as those talks might seem to my mother's mind and he would still have been received at combray but for one thing that same night after dinner having informed me a piece of news which had a great influence on my later life making it happier at one time and then more unhappy that no woman ever thought of anything but love and that there was not one of them whose resistance a man could not overcome he had gone on to assure me that he had heard it said on unimpeachable authority that my great aunt herself had led a 'gay' life in her younger days and had been notoriously 'kept ' i could not refrain from passing on so important a piece of information to my parents the next time bloch called he was not admitted and afterwards when i met him in the street he greeted me with extreme coldness but in the matter of bergotte he had spoken truly for the first few days like a tune which will be running in one's head and maddening one soon enough but of which one has not for the moment 'got hold ' the things i was to love so passionately in bergotte's style had not yet caught my eye i could not it is true lay down the novel of his which i was reading but i fancied that i was interested in the story alone as in the first dawn of love when we go every day to meet a woman at some party or entertainment by the charm of which we imagine it is that we are attracted then i observed the rare almost archaic phrases which he liked to employ at certain points where a hidden flow of harmony a prelude contained and concealed in the work itself would animate and elevate his style and it was at such points as these too that he would begin to speak of the vain dream of life of the inexhaustible torrent of fair forms of the sterile splendid torture of understanding and loving of the moving effigies which ennoble for all time the charming and venerable fronts of our cathedrals that he would express a whole system of philosophy new to me by the use of marvellous imagery to the inspiration of which i would naturally have ascribed that sound of harping which began to chime and echo in my ears an accompaniment to which that imagery added something ethereal and sublime one of these passages of bergotte the third or fourth which i had detached from the rest filled me with a joy to which the meagre joy i had tasted in the first passage bore no comparison a joy which i felt myself to have experienced in some innermost chamber of my soul deep undivided vast from which all obstructions and partitions seemed to have been swept away for what had happened was that while i recognised in this passage the same taste for uncommon phrases the same bursts of music the same idealist philosophy which had been present in the earlier passages without my having taken them into account as the source of my pleasure i now no longer had the impression of being confronted by a particular passage in one of bergotte's works which traced a purely bi dimensional figure in outline upon the surface of my mind but rather of the 'ideal passage' of bergotte common to every one of his books and to which all the earlier similar passages now becoming merged in it had added a kind of density and volume by which my own understanding seemed to be enlarged i was by no means bergotte's sole admirer he was the favourite writer also of a friend of my mother's a highly literary lady while dr du boulbon had kept all his patients waiting until he finished bergotte's latest volume and it was from his consulting room and from a house in a park near combray that some of the first seeds were scattered of that taste for bergotte a rare growth in those days but now so universally acclimatised that one finds it flowering everywhere throughout europe and america and even in the tiniest villages rare still in its refinement but in that alone what my mother's friend and it would seem what dr du boulbon liked above all in the writings of bergotte was just what i liked the same flow of melody the same old fashioned phrases and certain others quite simple and familiar but so placed by him in such prominence as to hint at a particular quality of taste on his part and also in the sad parts of his books a sort of roughness a tone that was almost harsh and he himself no doubt realised that these were his principal attractions for in his later books if he had hit upon some great truth or upon the name of an historic cathedral he would break off his narrative and in an invocation an apostrophe a lengthy prayer would give a free outlet to that effluence which in the earlier volumes remained buried beneath the form of his prose discernible only in a rippling of its surface and perhaps even more delightful more harmonious when it was thus veiled from the eye when the reader could give no precise indication of where the murmur of the current began or of where it died away these passages in which he delighted were our favourites also for my own part i knew all of them by heart i felt even disappointed when he resumed the thread of his narrative whenever he spoke of something whose beauty had until then remained hidden from me of pine forests or of hailstorms of notre dame de paris of athalie or of phèdre by some piece of imagery he would make their beauty explode and drench me with its essence and so dimly realising that the universe contained innumerable elements which my feeble senses would be powerless to discern did he not bring them within my reach i wished that i might have his opinion some metaphor of his upon everything in the world and especially upon such things as i might have an opportunity some day of seeing for myself and among such things more particularly still upon some of the historic buildings of france upon certain views of the sea because the emphasis with which in his books he referred to these shewed that he regarded them as rich in significance and beauty but alas upon almost everything in the world his opinion was unknown to me i had no doubt that it would differ entirely from my own since his came down from an unknown sphere towards which i was striving to raise myself convinced that my thoughts would have seemed pure foolishness to that perfected spirit i had so completely obliterated them all that if i happened to find in one of his books something which had already occurred to my own mind my heart would swell with gratitude and pride as though some deity had in his infinite bounty restored it to me had pronounced it to be beautiful and right it happened now and then that a page of bergotte would express precisely those ideas which i used often at night when i was unable to sleep to write to my grandmother and mother and so concisely and well that his page had the appearance of a collection of mottoes for me to set at the head of my letters and so too in later years when i began to compose a book of my own and the quality of some of my sentences seemed so inadequate that i could not make up my mind to go on with the undertaking i would find the equivalent of my sentences in bergotte's but it was only then when i read them in his pages that i could enjoy them when it was i myself who composed them in my anxiety that they should exactly reproduce what i seemed to have detected in my mind and in my fear of their not turning out 'true to life ' i had no time to ask myself whether what i was writing would be pleasant to read but indeed there was no kind of language no kind of ideas which i really liked except these my feverish and unsatisfactory attempts were themselves a token of my love a love which brought me no pleasure but was for all that intense and deep and so when i came suddenly upon similar phrases in the writings of another that is to say stripped of their familiar accompaniment of scruples and repressions and self tormentings i was free to indulge to the full my own appetite for such things just as a cook who once in a while has no dinner to prepare for other people can then find time to gormandise himself and so when i had found one day in a book by bergotte some joke about an old family servant to which his solemn and magnificent style added a great deal of irony but which was in principle what i had often said to my grandmother about françoise and when another time i had discovered that he thought not unworthy of reflection in one of those mirrors of absolute truth which were his writings a remark similar to one which i had had occasion to make on our friend m legrandin and moreover my remarks on françoise and m legrandin were among those which i would most resolutely have sacrificed for bergotte's sake in the belief that he would find them quite without interest then it was suddenly revealed to me that my own humble existence and the realms of truth were less widely separated than i had supposed that at certain points they were actually in contact and in my new found confidence and joy i wept upon his printed page as in the arms of a long lost father from his books i had formed an impression of bergotte as a frail and disappointed old man who had lost his children and had never found any consolation and so i would read or rather sing his sentences in my brain with rather more dolce rather more lento than he himself had perhaps intended and his simplest phrase would strike my ears with something peculiarly gentle and loving in its intonation more than anything else in the world i cherished his philosophy and had pledged myself to it in lifelong devotion it made me impatient to reach the age when i should be eligible to attend the class at school called 'philosophy ' i did not wish to learn or do anything else there but simply to exist and be guided entirely by the mind of bergotte and if i had been told then that the metaphysicians whom i was actually to follow there resembled him in nothing i should have been struck down by the despair a young lover feels who has sworn lifelong fidelity when a friend speaks to him of the other mistresses he will have in time to come one sunday while i was reading in the garden i was interrupted by swann who had come to call upon my parents what are you reading may i look why it's bergotte who has been telling you about him i replied that bloch was responsible oh yes that boy i saw here once who looks so like the bellini portrait of mahomet ii it's an astonishing likeness he has the same arched eyebrows and hooked nose and prominent cheekbones when his beard comes he'll be mahomet himself anyhow he has good taste for bergotte is a charming creature and seeing how much i seemed to admire bergotte swann who never spoke at all about the people he knew made an exception in my favour and said i know him well if you would like him to write a few words on the title page of your book i could ask him for you i dared not accept such an offer but bombarded swann with questions about his friend can you tell me please who is his favourite actor actor no i can't say but i do know this there's not a man on the stage whom he thinks equal to berma he puts her above everyone have you seen her no sir my parents do not allow me to go to the theatre that is a pity you should insist berma in phèdre in the cid well she's only an actress if you like but you know that i don't believe very much in the 'hierarchy' of the arts as he spoke i noticed what had often struck me before in his conversations with my grandmother's sisters that whenever he spoke of serious matters whenever he used an expression which seemed to imply a definite opinion upon some important subject he would take care to isolate to sterilise it by using a special intonation mechanical and ironic as though he had put the phrase or word between inverted commas and was anxious to disclaim any personal responsibility for it as who should say the 'hierarchy ' don't you know as silly people call it but then if it was so absurd why did he say the 'hierarchy' a moment later he went on her acting will give you as noble an inspiration as any masterpiece of art in the world as oh i don't know and he began to laugh shall we say the queens of chartres until then i had supposed that his horror of having to give a serious opinion was something parisian and refined in contrast to the provincial dogmatism of my grandmother's sisters and i had imagined also that it was characteristic of the mental attitude towards life of the circle in which swann moved where by a natural reaction from the 'lyrical' enthusiasms of earlier generations an excessive importance was given to small and precise facts formerly regarded as vulgar and anything in the nature of 'phrase making' was banned but now i found myself slightly shocked by this attitude which swann invariably adopted when face to face with generalities he appeared unwilling to risk even having an opinion and to be at his ease only when he could furnish with meticulous accuracy some precise but unimportant detail but in so doing he did not take into account that even here he was giving an opinion holding a brief as they say for something that the accuracy of his details had an importance of its own i thought again of the dinner that night when i had been so unhappy because mamma would not be coming up to my room and when he had dismissed the balls given by the princesse de léon as being of no importance and yet it was to just that sort of amusement that he was devoting his life for what other kind of existence did he reserve the duties of saying in all seriousness what he thought about things of formulating judgments which he would not put between inverted commas and when would he cease to give himself up to occupations of which at the same time he made out that they were absurd i noticed too in the manner in which swann spoke to me of bergotte something which to do him justice was not peculiar to himself but was shared by all that writer's admirers at that time at least by my mother's friend and by dr du boulbon like swann they would say of bergotte he has a charming mind so individual he has a way of his own of saying things which is a little far fetched but so pleasant you never need to look for his name on the title page you can tell his work at once but none of them had yet gone so far as to say he is a great writer he has great talent they did not even credit him with talent at all they did not speak because they were not aware of it we are very slow in recognising in the peculiar physiognomy of a new writer the type which is labelled 'great talent' in our museum of general ideas simply because that physiognomy is new and strange we can find in it no resemblance to what we are accustomed to call talent we say rather originality charm delicacy strength and then one day we add up the sum of these and find that it amounts simply to talent are there any books in which bergotte has written about berma i asked m swann i think he has in that little essay on racine but it must be out of print still there has perhaps been a second impression i will find out anyhow i can ask bergotte himself all that you want to know next time he comes to dine with us he never misses a week from one year's end to another he is my daughter's greatest friend they go about together and look at old towns and cathedrals and castles as i was still completely ignorant of the different grades in the social hierarchy the fact that my father found it impossible for us to see anything of swann's wife and daughter had for a long time had the contrary effect of making me imagine them as separated from us by an enormous gulf which greatly enhanced their dignity and importance in my eyes i was sorry that my mother did not dye her hair and redden her lips as i had heard our neighbour mme sazerat say that mme swann did to gratify not her husband but m de charlus and i felt that to her we must be an object of scorn which distressed me particularly on account of the daughter such a pretty little girl as i had heard and one of whom i used often to dream always imagining her with the same features and appearance which i bestowed upon her quite arbitrarily but with a charming effect but from this afternoon when i had learned that mlle swann was a creature living in such rare and fortunate circumstances bathed as in her natural element in such a sea of privilege that if she should ask her parents whether anyone were coming to dinner she would be answered in those two syllables radiant with celestial light would hear the name of that golden guest who was to her no more than an old friend of her family bergotte that for her the intimate conversation at table corresponding to what my great aunt's conversation was for me would be the words of bergotte upon all those subjects which he had not been able to take up in his writings and on which i would fain have heard him utter oracles and that above all when she went to visit other towns he would be walking by her side unrecognised and glorious like the gods who came down of old from heaven to dwell among mortal men then i realised both the rare worth of a creature such as mlle swann and at the same time how coarse and ignorant i should appear to her and i felt so keenly how pleasant and yet how impossible it would be for me to become her friend that i was filled at once with longing and with despair and usually from this time forth when i thought of her i would see her standing before the porch of a cathedral explaining to me what each of the statues meant and with a smile which was my highest commendation presenting me as her friend to bergotte and invariably the charm of all the fancies which the thought of cathedrals used to inspire in me the charm of the hills and valleys of the he de france and of the plains of normandy would radiate brightness and beauty over the picture i had formed in my mind of mlle swann nothing more remained but to know and to love her once we believe that a fellow creature has a share in some unknown existence to which that creature's love for ourselves can win us admission that is of all the preliminary conditions which love exacts the one to which he attaches most importance the one which makes him generous or indifferent as to the rest even those women who pretend that they judge a man by his exterior only see in that exterior an emanation from some special way of life and that is why they fall in love with a soldier or a fireman whose uniform makes them less particular about his face they kiss and believe that beneath the crushing breastplate there beats a heart different from the rest more gallant more adventurous more tender and so it is that a young king or a crown prince may travel in foreign countries and make the most gratifying conquests and yet lack entirely that regular and classic profile which would be indispensable i dare say in an outside broker while i was reading in the garden a thing my great aunt would never have understood my doing save on a sunday that being the day on which it was unlawful to indulge in any serious occupation and on which she herself would lay aside her sewing on a week day she would have said how you can go on amusing yourself with a book it isn't sunday you know putting into the word 'amusing' an implication of childishness and waste of time my aunt léonie would be gossiping with françoise until it was time for eulalie to arrive she would tell her that she had just seen mme goupil go by without an umbrella in the silk dress she had made for her the other day at châteaudun if she has far to go before vespers she may get it properly soaked very likely which meant also very likely not was the answer for françoise did not wish definitely to exclude the possibility of a happier alternative there now went on my aunt beating her brow that reminds me that i never heard if she got to church this morning before the elevation i must remember to ask eulalie françoise just look at that black cloud behind the steeple and how poor the light is on the slates you may be certain it will rain before the day is out it couldn't possibly keep on like this it's been too hot and the sooner the better for until the storm breaks my vichy water won't 'go down ' she concluded since in her mind the desire to accelerate the digestion of her vichy water was of infinitely greater importance than her fear of seeing mme goupil's new dress ruined very likely and you know that when it rains in the square there's none too much shelter suddenly my aunt turned pale what three o'clock she exclaimed but vespers will have begun already and i've forgotten my pepsin now i know why that vichy water has been lying on my stomach and falling precipitately upon a prayer book bound in purple velvet with gilt clasps out of which in her haste she let fall a shower of the little pictures each in a lace fringe of yellowish paper which she used to mark the places of the greater feasts of the church my aunt while she swallowed her drops began at full speed to mutter the words of the sacred text its meaning being slightly clouded in her brain by the uncertainty whether the pepsin when taken so long after the vichy would still be able to overtake it and to 'send it down ' three o'clock it's unbelievable how time flies a little tap at the window as though some missile had struck it followed by a plentiful falling sound as light though as if a shower of sand were being sprinkled from a window overhead then the fall spread took on an order a rhythm became liquid loud drumming musical innumerable universal it was the rain there françoise what did i tell you how it's coming down but i think i heard the bell at the garden gate go along and see who can be outside in this weather françoise went and returned it's mme amédée my grandmother she said she was going for a walk it's raining hard all the same i'm not at all surprised said my aunt looking up towards the sky i've always said that she was not in the least like other people well i'm glad it's she and not myself who's outside in all this mme amédée is always the exact opposite of the rest said françoise not unkindly refraining until she should be alone with the other servants from stating her belief that my grandmother was 'a bit off her head ' there's benediction over eulalie will never come now sighed my aunt it will be the weather that's frightened her away but it's not five o'clock yet mme octave it's only half past four only half past four and here am i obliged to draw back the small curtains just to get a tiny streak of daylight at half past four only a week before the rogation days ah my poor françoise the dear lord must be sorely vexed with us the world is going too far in these days as my poor octave used to say we have forgotten god too often and he is taking vengeance upon us a bright flush animated my aunt's cheeks it was eulalie as ill luck would have it scarcely had she been admitted to the presence when françoise reappeared and with a smile which was meant to indicate her full participation in the pleasure which she had no doubt her tidings would give my aunt articulating each syllable so as to shew that in spite of her having to translate them into indirect speech she was repeating as a good servant should the very words which the new visitor had condescended to use said his reverence the curé would be delighted enchanted if mme octave is not resting just now and could see him his reverence does not wish to disturb mme octave his reverence is downstairs i told him to go into the parlour had the truth been known the curé's visits gave my aunt no such ecstatic pleasure as françoise supposed and the air of jubilation with which she felt bound to illuminate her face whenever she had to announce his arrival did not altogether correspond to what was felt by her invalid the curé an excellent man with whom i am sorry now that i did not converse more often for even if he cared nothing for the arts he knew a great many etymologies being in the habit of shewing distinguished visitors over his church he had even planned to compile a history of the parish of combray used to weary her with his endless explanations which incidentally never varied in the least degree but when his visit synchronized exactly with eulalie's it became frankly distasteful to my aunt she would have preferred to make the most of eulalie and not to have had the whole of her circle about her at one time but she dared not send the curé away and had to content herself with making a sign to eulalie not to leave when he did so that she might have her to herself for a little after he had gone what is this i have been hearing father that a painter has set up his easel in your church and is copying one of the windows old as i am i can safely say that i have never even heard of such a thing in all my life what is the world coming to next i wonder and the ugliest thing in the whole church too i will not go so far as to say that it is quite the ugliest for although there are certain things in saint hilaire which are well worth a visit there are others that are very old now in my poor basilica the only one in all the diocese that has never even been restored the lord knows our porch is dirty and out of date still it is of a majestic character take for instance the esther tapestries though personally i would not give a brass farthing for the pair of them but experts put them next after the ones at sens i can quite see too that apart from certain details which are well a trifle realistic they shew features which testify to a genuine power of observation but don't talk to me about the windows is it common sense i ask you to leave up windows which shut out all the daylight and even confuse the eyes by throwing patches of colour to which i should be hard put to it to give a name on a floor in which there are not two slabs on the same level and yet they refuse to renew the floor for me because if you please those are the tombstones of the abbots of combray and the lords of guermantes the old counts you know of brabant direct ancestors of the present duc de guermantes and of his duchesse also since she was a lady of the guermantes family and married her cousin my grandmother whose steady refusal to take any interest in 'persons' had ended in her confusing all their names and titles whenever anyone mentioned the duchesse de guermantes used to make out that she must be related to mme de villeparisis the whole family would then burst out laughing and she would attempt to justify herself by harking back to some invitation to a christening or funeral i feel sure that there was a guermantes in it somewhere and for once i would side with the others and against her refusing to admit that there could be any connection between her school friend and the descendant of geneviève de brabant look at roussainville the curé went on it is nothing more nowadays than a parish of farmers though in olden times the place must have had a considerable importance from its trade in felt hats and clocks i am not certain by the way of the etymology of roussainville i should dearly like to think that the name was originally rouville from radulfi villa analogous don't you see to châteauroux castrum radulfi but we will talk about that some other time very well the church there has superb windows almost all quite modern including that most imposing 'entry of louis philippe into combray' which would be more in keeping surely at combray itself and which is every bit as good i understand as the famous windows at chartres only yesterday i met dr percepied's brother who goes in for these things and he told me that he looked upon it as a most beautiful piece of work but as i said to this artist who by the way seems to be a most civil fellow and is a regular virtuoso it appears with his brush what on earth i said to him do you find so extraordinary in this window which is if anything a little dingier than the rest i am sure that if you were to ask his lordship said my aunt in a resigned tone for she had begun to feel that she was going to be 'tired ' he would never refuse you a new window you may depend upon it mme octave replied the curé why it was just his lordship himself who started the outcry about the window by proving that it represented gilbert the bad a lord of guermantes and a direct descendant of geneviève de brabant who was a daughter of the house of guermantes receiving absolution from saint hilaire but i don't see where saint hilaire comes in why yes have you never noticed in the corner of the window a lady in a yellow robe very well that is saint hilaire who is also known you will remember in certain parts of the country as saint illiers saint hèlier and even in the jura saint ylie but these various corruptions of sanctus hilarius are by no means the most curious that have occurred in the names of the blessed saints take for example my good eulalie the case of your own patron sancta eulalia do you know what she has become in burgundy saint eloi nothing more nor less the lady has become a gentleman do you hear that eulalie after you are dead they will make a man of you father will always have his joke gilbert's brother charles the stammerer was a pious prince but having early in life lost his father pepin the mad who died as a result of his mental infirmity he wielded the supreme power with all the arrogance of a man who has not been subjected to discipline in his youth so much so that whenever he saw a man in a town whose face he did not remember he would massacre the whole place to the last inhabitant gilbert wishing to be avenged on charles caused the church at combray to be burned down the original church that was which théodebert when he and his court left the country residence he had near here at thiberzy which is of course theodeberiacus to go out and fight the burgundians had promised to build over the tomb of saint hilaire if the saint brought him victory nothing remains of it now but the crypt into which théodore has probably taken you for gilbert burned all the rest finally he defeated the unlucky charles with the aid of william which the curé pronounced will'am the conqueror which is why so many english still come to visit the place but he does not appear to have managed to win the affection of the people of combray for they fell upon him as he was coming out from mass and cut off his head théodore has a little book that he lends people which tells you the whole story but what is unquestionably the most remarkable thing about our church is the view from the belfry which is full of grandeur certainly in your case since you are not very strong i should never recommend you to climb our seven and ninety steps just half the number they have in the famous cathedral at milan it is quite tiring enough for the most active person especially as you have to go on your hands and knees if you don't wish to crack your skull and you collect all the cobwebs off the staircase upon your clothes in any case you should be well wrapped up he went on without noticing my aunt's fury at the mere suggestion that she could ever possibly be capable of climbing into his belfry for there's a strong breeze there once you get to the top some people even assure me that they have felt the chill of death up there no matter on sundays there are always clubs and societies who come some of them long distances to admire our beautiful panorama and they always go home charmed wait now next sunday if the weather holds you will be sure to find a lot of people there for rogation tide you must admit certainly that the view from up there is like a fairy tale with what you might call vistas along the plain which have quite a special charm of their own on a clear day you can see as far as verneuil and then another thing you can see at the same time places which you are in the habit of seeing one without the other as for instance the course of the vivonne and the ditches at saint assise lès combray which are separated really by a screen of tall trees or to take another example there are all the canals at jouy le vicomte which is gaudiacus vicecomitis as of course you know each time that i have been to jouy i have seen a bit of a canal in one place and then i have turned a corner and seen another but when i saw the second i could no longer see the first i tried in vain to imagine how they lay by one another it was no good but from the top of saint hilaire it's quite another matter the whole countryside is spread out before you like a map only you cannot make out the water you would say that there were great rifts in the town slicing it up so neatly that it looks like a loaf of bread which still holds together after it has been cut up to get it all quite perfect you would have to be in both places at once up here on the top of saint hilaire and down there at jouy le vicomte the curé had so much exhausted my aunt that no sooner had he gone than she was obliged to send away eulalie also here my poor eulalie she said in a feeble voice drawing a coin from a small purse which lay ready to her hand this is just something so that you shall not forget me in your prayers oh but mme octave i don't think i ought to you know very well that i don't come here for that so eulalie would answer with the same hesitation and the same embarrassment every sunday as though each temptation were the first and with a look of displeasure which enlivened my aunt and never offended her for if it so happened that eulalie when she took the money looked a little less sulky than usual my aunt would remark afterwards i cannot think what has come over eulalie i gave her just the trifle i always give and she did not look at all pleased i don't think she has very much to complain of all the same françoise would sigh grimly for she had a tendency to regard as petty cash all that my aunt might give her for herself or her children and as treasure riotously squandered on a pampered and ungrateful darling the little coins slipped sunday by sunday into eulalie's hand but so discreetly passed that françoise never managed to see them it was not that she wanted to have for herself the money my aunt bestowed on eulalie she already enjoyed a sufficiency of all that my aunt possessed in the knowledge that the wealth of the mistress automatically ennobled and glorified the maid in the eyes of the world and that she herself was conspicuous and worthy to be praised throughout combray jouy le vicomte and other cities of men on account of my aunt's many farms her frequent and prolonged visits from the curé and the astonishing number of bottles of vichy water which she consumed françoise was avaricious only for my aunt had she had control over my aunt's fortune which would have more than satisfied her highest ambition she would have guarded it from the assaults of strangers with a maternal ferocity she would however have seen no great harm in what my aunt whom she knew to be incurably generous allowed herself to give away had she given only to those who were already rich perhaps she felt that such persons not being actually in need of my aunt's presents could not be suspected of simulating affection for her on that account besides presents offered to persons of great wealth and position such as mme sazerat m swann m legrandin and mme goupil to persons of the 'same class' as my aunt and who would naturally 'mix with her ' seemed to françoise to be included among the ornamental customs of that strange and brilliant life led by rich people who hunted and shot gave balls and paid visits a life which she would contemplate with an admiring smile but it was by no means the same thing if for this princely exchange of courtesies my aunt substituted mere charity if her beneficiaries were of the class which françoise would label people like myself or people no better than myself people whom she despised even more if they did not address her always as mme françoise just to shew that they considered themselves to be 'not as good ' and when she saw that despite all her warnings my aunt continued to do exactly as she pleased and to fling money away with both hands or so at least françoise believed on undeserving objects she began to find that the presents she herself received from my aunt were very tiny compared to the imaginary riches squandered upon eulalie there was not in the neighbourhood of combray a farm of such prosperity and importance that françoise doubted eulalie's ability to buy it without thinking twice out of the capital which her visits to my aunt had 'brought in ' it must be added that eulalie had formed an exactly similar estimate of the vast and secret hoards of françoise so every sunday after eulalie had gone françoise would mercilessly prophesy her coming downfall she hated eulalie but was at the same time afraid of her and so felt bound when eulalie was there to 'look pleasant ' but she would make up for that after the other's departure never it is true alluding to her by name but hinting at her in sibylline oracles or in utterances of a comprehensive character like those of ecclesiastes the preacher but so worded that their special application could not escape my aunt after peering out at the side of the curtain to see whether eulalie had shut the front door behind her flatterers know how to make themselves welcome and to gather up the crumbs but have patience have patience our god is a jealous god and one fine day he will be avenged upon them she would declaim with the sidelong insinuating glance of joash thinking of athaliah alone when he says that the prosperity of wicked men runs like a torrent past and soon is spent but on this memorable afternoon when the curé had come as well and by his interminable visit had drained my aunt's strength françoise followed eulalie from the room saying mme octave i will leave you to rest you look utterly tired out and my aunt answered her not a word breathing a sigh so faint that it seemed it must prove her last and lying there with closed eyes as though already dead but hardly had françoise arrived downstairs when four peals of a bell pulled with the utmost violence reverberated through the house and my aunt sitting erect upon her bed called out has eulalie gone yet would you believe it i forgot to ask her whether mme goupil arrived in church before the elevation run after her quick but françoise returned alone having failed to overtake eulalie it is most provoking said my aunt shaking her head the one important thing that i had to ask her in this way life went by for my aunt léonie always the same in the gentle uniformity of what she called with a pretence of deprecation but with a deep tenderness her 'little jog trot ' respected by all and sundry not merely in her own house where every one of us having learned the futility of recommending any healthier mode of life had become gradually resigned to its observance but in the village as well where three streets away a tradesman who had to hammer nails into a packing case would send first to françoise to make sure that my aunt was not 'resting' her 'little jog trot' was none the less brutally disturbed on one occasion in this same year like a fruit hidden among its leaves which has grown and ripened unobserved by man until it falls of its own accord there came upon us one night the kitchen maid's confinement her pains were unbearable and as there was no midwife in combray françoise had to set off before dawn to fetch one from thiberzy my aunt was unable to 'rest ' owing to the cries of the girl and as françoise though the distance was nothing was very late in returning her services were greatly missed and so in the course of the morning my mother said to me run upstairs and see if your aunt wants anything i went into the first of her two rooms and through the open door of the other saw my aunt lying on her side asleep i could hear her breathing in what was almost distinguishable as a snore i was just going to slip away when something probably the sound of my entry interrupted her sleep and made it 'change speed ' as they say of motorcars nowadays for the music of her snore broke off for a second and began again on a lower note then she awoke and half turned her face which i could see for the first time a kind of horror was imprinted on it plainly she had just escaped from some terrifying dream she could not see me from where she was lying and i stood there not knowing whether i ought to go forward or to retire but all at once she seemed to return to a sense of reality and to grasp the falsehood of the visions that had terrified her a smile of joy a pious act of thanksgiving to god who is pleased to grant that life shall be less cruel than our dreams feebly illumined her face and with the habit she had formed of speaking to herself half aloud when she thought herself alone she murmured the lord be praised we have nothing to disturb us here but the kitchen maid's baby and i've been dreaming that my poor octave had come back to life and was trying to make me take a walk every day she stretched out a hand towards her rosary which was lying on the small table but sleep was once again getting the mastery and did not leave her the strength to reach it she fell asleep calm and contented and i crept out of the room on tiptoe without either her or anyone's else ever knowing from that day to this what i had seen and heard when i say that apart from such rare happenings as this confinement my aunt's 'little jog trot' never underwent any variation i do not include those variations which repeated at regular intervals and in identical form did no more really than print a sort of uniform pattern upon the greater uniformity of her life so for instance every saturday as françoise had to go in the afternoon to market at roussainville le pin the whole household would have to have luncheon an hour earlier and my aunt had so thoroughly acquired the habit of this weekly exception to her general habits that she clung to it as much as to the rest she was so well 'routined' to it as françoise would say that if on a saturday she had had to wait for her luncheon until the regular hour it would have 'upset' her as much as if she had had on an ordinary day to put her luncheon forward to its saturday time incidentally this acceleration of luncheon gave saturday for all of us an individual character kindly and rather attractive at the moment when ordinarily there was still an hour to be lived through before meal time sounded we would all know that in a few seconds we should see the endives make their precocious appearance followed by the special favour of an omelette an unmerited steak the return of this asymmetrical saturday was one of those petty occurrences intra mural localised almost civic which in uneventful lives and stable orders of society create a kind of national unity and become the favourite theme for conversation for pleasantries for anecdotes which can be embroidered as the narrator pleases it would have provided a nucleus ready made for a legendary cycle if any of us had had the epic mind at daybreak before we were dressed without rhyme or reason save for the pleasure of proving the strength of our solidarity we would call to one another good humoredly cordially patriotically hurry up there's no time to be lost don't forget it's saturday while my aunt gossiping with françoise and reflecting that the day would be even longer than usual would say you might cook them a nice bit of veal seeing that it's saturday if at half past ten some one absent mindedly pulled out a watch and said i say an hour and a half still before luncheon everyone else would be in ecstasies over being able to retort at once why what are you thinking about have you for gotten that it's saturday and a quarter of an hour later we would still be laughing and reminding ourselves to go up and tell aunt léonie about this absurd mistake to amuse her the very face of the sky appeared to undergo a change after luncheon the sun conscious that it was saturday would blaze an hour longer in the zenith and when some one thinking that we were late in starting for our walk said what only two o'clock feeling the heavy throb go by him of the twin strokes from the steeple of saint hilaire which as a rule passed no one at that hour upon the highways deserted for the midday meal or for the nap which follows it or on the banks of the bright and ever flowing stream which even the angler had abandoned and so slipped unaccompanied into the vacant sky where only a few loitering clouds remained to greet them the whole family would respond in chorus why you're forgetting we had luncheon an hour earlier you know very well it's saturday the surprise of a 'barbarian' for so we termed everyone who was not acquainted with saturday's special customs who had called at eleven o'clock to speak to my father and had found us at table was an event which used to cause françoise as much merriment as perhaps anything that had ever happened in her life and if she found it amusing that the nonplussed visitor should not have known beforehand that we had our luncheon an hour earlier on saturday it was still more irresistibly funny that my father himself fully as she sympathised from the bottom of her heart with the rigid chauvinism which prompted him should never have dreamed that the barbarian could fail to be aware of so simple a matter and so had replied with no further enlightenment of the other's surprise at seeing us already in the dining room you see it's saturday on reaching this point in the story françoise would pause to wipe the tears of merriment from her eyes and then to add to her own enjoyment would prolong the dialogue inventing a further reply for the visitor to whom the word 'saturday' had conveyed nothing and so far from our objecting to these interpolations we would feel that the story was not yet long enough and would rally her with oh but surely he said something else as well there was more than that the first time you told it my great aunt herself would lay aside her work and raise her head and look on at us over her glasses the day had yet another characteristic feature namely that during may we used to go out on saturday evenings after dinner to the 'month of mary' devotions as we were liable there to meet m vinteuil who held very strict views on the deplorable untidiness of young people which seems to be encouraged in these days my mother would first see that there was nothing out of order in my appearance and then we would set out for the church it was in these 'month of mary' services that i can remember having first fallen in love with hawthorn blossom the hawthorn was not merely in the church for there holy ground as it was we had all of us a right of entry but arranged upon the altar itself inseparable from the mysteries in whose celebration it was playing a part it thrust in among the tapers and the sacred vessels its rows of branches tied to one another horizontally in a stiff festal scheme of decoration and they were made more lovely still by the scalloped outline of the dark leaves over which were scattered in profusion as over a bridal train little clusters of buds of a dazzling whiteness though i dared not look at them save through my fingers i could feel that the formal scheme was composed of living things and that it was nature herself who by trimming the shape of the foliage and by adding the crowning ornament of those snowy buds had made the decorations worthy of what was at once a public rejoicing and a solemn mystery higher up on the altar a flower had opened here and there with a careless grace holding so unconcernedly like a final almost vaporous bedizening its bunch of stamens slender as gossamer which clouded the flower itself in a white mist that in following these with my eyes in trying to imitate somewhere inside myself the action of their blossoming i imagined it as a swift and thoughtless movement of the head with an enticing glance from her contracted pupils by a young girl in white careless and alive m vinteuil had come in with his daughter and had sat down beside us he belonged to a good family and had once been music master to my grandmother's sisters so that when after losing his wife and inheriting some property he had retired to the neighbourhood of combray we used often to invite him to our house but with his intense prudishness he had given up coming so as not to be obliged to meet swann who had made what he called a most unsuitable marriage as seems to be the fashion in these days my mother on hearing that he 'composed ' told him by way of a compliment that when she came to see him he must play her something of his own m vinteuil would have liked nothing better but he carried politeness and consideration for others to so fine a point always putting himself in their place that he was afraid of boring them or of appearing egotistical if he carried out or even allowed them to suspect what were his own desires on the day when my parents had gone to pay him a visit i had accompanied them but they had allowed me to remain outside and as m vinteuil's house montjouvain stood on a site actually hollowed out from a steep hill covered with shrubs among which i took cover i had found myself on a level with his drawing room upstairs and only a few feet away from its window when a servant came in to tell him that my parents had arrived i had seen m vinteuil run to the piano and lay out a sheet of music so as to catch the eye but as soon as they entered the room he had snatched it away and hidden it in a corner he was afraid no doubt of letting them suppose that he was glad to see them only because it gave him a chance of playing them some of his compositions and every time that my mother in the course of her visit had returned to the subject of his playing he had hurriedly protested i cannot think who put that on the piano it is not the proper place for it at all and had turned the conversation aside to other topics simply because those were of less interest to himself his one and only passion was for his daughter and she with her somewhat boyish appearance looked so robust that it was hard to restrain a smile when one saw the precautions her father used to take for her health with spare shawls always in readiness to wrap around her shoulders my grandmother had drawn our attention to the gentle delicate almost timid expression which might often be caught flitting across the face dusted all over with freckles of this otherwise stolid child when she had spoken she would at once take her own words in the sense in which her audience must have heard them she would be alarmed at the possibility of a misunderstanding and one would see in clear outline as though in a transparency beneath the mannish face of the 'good sort' that she was the finer features of a young woman in tears when before turning to leave the church i made a genuflection before the altar i felt suddenly as i rose again a bitter sweet fragrance of almonds steal towards me from the hawthorn blossom and i then noticed that on the flowers themselves were little spots of a creamier colour in which i imagined that this fragrance must lie concealed as the taste of an almond cake lay in the burned parts or the sweetness of mlle vinteuil's cheeks beneath their freckles despite the heavy motionless silence of the hawthorns these gusts of fragrance came to me like the murmuring of an intense vitality with which the whole altar was quivering like a roadside hedge explored by living antennae of which i was reminded by seeing some stamens almost red in colour which seemed to have kept the springtime virulence the irritant power of stinging insects now transmuted into flowers outside the church we would stand talking for a moment with m vinteuil in the porch boys would be chevying one another in the square and he would interfere taking the side of the little ones and lecturing the big if his daughter said in her thick comfortable voice how glad she had been to see us immediately it would seem as though some elder and more sensitive sister latent in her had blushed at this thoughtless schoolboyish utterance which had perhaps made us think that she was angling for an invitation to the house her father would then arrange a cloak over her shoulders they would clamber into a little dog cart which she herself drove and home they would both go to montjouvain as for ourselves the next day being sunday with no need to be up and stirring before high mass if it was a moonlight night and warm then instead of taking us home at once my father in his thirst for personal distinction would lead us on a long walk round by the calvary which my mother's utter incapacity for taking her bearings or even for knowing which road she might be on made her regard as a triumph of his strategic genius sometimes we would go as far as the viaduct which began to stride on its long legs of stone at the railway station and to me typified all the wretchedness of exile beyond the last outposts of civilisation because every year as we came down from paris we would be warned to take special care when we got to combray not to miss the station to be ready before the train stopped since it would start again in two minutes and proceed across the viaduct out of the lands of christendom of which combray to me represented the farthest limit we would return by the boulevard de la gare which contained the most attractive villas in the town in each of their gardens the moonlight copying the art of hubert robert had scattered its broken staircases of white marble its fountains of water and gates temptingly ajar its beams had swept away the telegraph office all that was left of it was a column half shattered but preserving the beauty of a ruin which endures for all time i would by now be dragging my weary limbs and ready to drop with sleep the balmy scent of the lime trees seemed a consolation which i could obtain only at the price of great suffering and exhaustion and not worthy of the effort from gates far apart the watchdogs awakened by our steps in the silence would set up an antiphonal barking as i still hear them bark at times in the evenings and it is in their custody when the public gardens of combray were constructed on its site that the boulevard de la gare must have taken refuge for wherever i may be as soon as they begin their alternate challenge and acceptance i can see it again with all its lime trees and its pavement glistening beneath the moon suddenly my father would bring us to a standstill and ask my mother where are we utterly worn out by the walk but still proud of her husband she would lovingly confess that she had not the least idea he would shrug his shoulders and laugh and then as though it had slipped with his latchkey from his waistcoat pocket he would point out to us when it stood before our eyes the back gate of our own garden which had come hand in hand with the familiar corner of the rue du saint esprit to await us to greet us at the end of our wanderings over paths unknown my mother would murmur admiringly you really are wonderful and from that instant i had not to take another step the ground moved forward under my feet in that garden where for so long my actions had ceased to require any control or even attention from my will custom came to take me in her arms carried me all the way up to my bed and laid me down there like a little child although saturday by beginning an hour earlier and by depriving her of the services of françoise passed more slowly than other days for my aunt yet the moment it was past and a new week begun she would look forward with impatience to its return as something that embodied all the novelty and distraction which her frail and disordered body was still able to endure this was not to say however that she did not long at times for some even greater variation that she did not pass through those abnormal hours in which one thirsts for something different from what one has when those people who through lack of energy or imagination are unable to generate any motive power in themselves cry out as the clock strikes or the postman knocks in their eagerness for news even if it be bad news for some emotion even that of grief when the heartstrings which prosperity has silenced like a harp laid by yearn to be plucked and sounded again by some hand even a brutal hand even if it shall break them when the will which has with such difficulty brought itself to subdue its impulse to renounce its right to abandon itself to its own uncontrolled desires and consequent sufferings would fain cast its guiding reins into the hands of circumstances coercive and it may be cruel of course since my aunt's strength which was completely drained by the slightest exertion returned but drop by drop into the pool of her repose the reservoir was very slow in filling and months would go by before she reached that surplus which other people use up in their daily activities but which she had no idea and could never decide how to employ and i have no doubt that then just as a desire to have her potatoes served with béchamel sauce for a change would be formed ultimately from the pleasure she found in the daily reappearance of those mashed potatoes of which she was never 'tired' she would extract from the accumulation of those monotonous days on which she so much depended a keen expectation of some domestic cataclysm instantaneous in its happening but violent enough to compel her to put into effect once for all one of those changes which she knew would be beneficial to her health but to which she could never make up her mind without some such stimulus she was genuinely fond of us she would have enjoyed the long luxury of weeping for our untimely decease coming at a moment when she felt 'well' and was not in a perspiration the news that the house was being destroyed by a fire in which all the rest of us had already perished a fire which in a little while would not leave one stone standing upon another but from which she herself would still have plenty of time to escape without undue haste provided that she rose at once from her bed must often have haunted her dreams as a prospect which combined with the two minor advantages of letting her taste the full savour of her affection for us in long years of mourning and of causing universal stupefaction in the village when she should sally forth to conduct our obsequies crushed but courageous moribund but erect the paramount and priceless boon of forcing her at the right moment with no time to be lost no room for weakening hesitations to go off and spend the summer at her charming farm of mirougrain where there was a waterfall inasmuch as nothing of this sort had ever occurred though indeed she must often have pondered the success of such a manoeuvre as she lay alone absorbed in her interminable games of patience and though it must have plunged her in despair from the first moment of its realisation from the first of those little unforeseen facts the first word of calamitous news whose accents can never afterwards be expunged from the memory everything that bears upon it the imprint of actual physical death so terribly different from the logical abstraction of its possibility she would fall back from time to time to add an interest to her life upon imagining other minor catastrophes which she would follow up with passion she would beguile herself with a sudden suspicion that françoise had been robbing her that she had set a trap to make certain and had caught her betrayer red handed and being in the habit when she made up a game of cards by herself of playing her own and her adversary's hands at once she would first stammer out françoise's awkward apologies and then reply to them with such a fiery indignation that any of us who happened to intrude upon her at one of these moments would find her bathed in perspiration her eyes blazing her false hair pushed awry and exposing the baldness of her brows françoise must often from the next room have heard these mordant sarcasms levelled at herself the mere framing of which in words would not have relieved my aunt's feelings sufficiently had they been allowed to remain in a purely immaterial form without the degree of substance and reality which she added to them by murmuring them half aloud sometimes however even these counterpane dramas would not satisfy my aunt she must see her work staged and so on a sunday with all the doors mysteriously closed she would confide in eulalie her doubts of françoise's integrity and her determination to be rid of her and on another day she would confide in françoise her suspicions of the disloyalty of eulalie to whom the front door would very soon be closed for good a few days more and disgusted with her latest confidant she would again be 'as thick as thieves' with the traitor while before the next performance the two would once more have changed their parts but the suspicions which eulalie might occasionally breed in her were no more than a fire of straw which must soon subside for lack of fuel since eulalie was not living with her in the house it was a very different matter when the suspect was françoise of whose presence under the same roof as herself my aunt was perpetually conscious while for fear of catching cold were she to leave her bed she would never dare go downstairs to the kitchen to see for herself whether there was indeed any foundation for her suspicions and so on by degrees until her mind had no other occupation than to attempt at every hour of the day to discover what was being done what was being concealed from her by françoise she would detect the most furtive movement of françoise's features something contradictory in what she was saying some desire which she appeared to be screening and she would shew her that she was unmasked by a single word which made françoise turn pale and which my aunt seemed to find a cruel satisfaction in driving into her unhappy servant's heart and the very next sunday a disclosure by eulalie like one of those discoveries which suddenly open up an unsuspected field for exploration to some new science which has hitherto followed only the beaten paths proved to my aunt that her own worst suspicions fell a long way short of the appalling truth but françoise ought to know that said eulalie now that you have given her a carriage now that i have given her a carriage gasped my aunt oh but i didn't know i only thought so i saw her go by yesterday in her open coach as proud as artaban on her way to roussainville market i supposed that it must be mme octave who had given it to her so on by degrees until françoise and my aunt the quarry and the hunter could never cease from trying to forestall each other's devices my mother was afraid lest françoise should develop a genuine hatred of my aunt who was doing everything in her power to annoy her however that might be françoise had come more and more to pay an infinitely scrupulous attention to my aunt's least word and gesture when she had to ask her for anything she would hesitate first for a long time making up her mind how best to begin and when she had uttered her request she would watch my aunt covertly trying to guess from the expression on her face what she thought of it and how she would reply and in this way whereas an artist who had been reading memoirs of the seventeenth century and wished to bring himself nearer to the great louis would consider that he was making progress in that direction when he constructed a pedigree that traced his own descent from some historic family or when he engaged in correspondence with one of the reigning sovereigns of europe and so would shut his eyes to the mistake he was making in seeking to establish a similarity by an exact and therefore lifeless copy of mere outward forms a middle aged lady in a small country town by doing no more than yield whole hearted obedience to her own irresistible eccentricities and to a spirit of mischief engendered by the utter idleness of her existence could see without ever having given a thought to louis xiv the most trivial occupations of her daily life her morning toilet her luncheon her afternoon nap assume by virtue of their despotic singularity something of the interest that was to be found in what saint simon used to call the 'machinery' of life at versailles and was able too to persuade herself that her silence a shade of good humour or of arrogance on her features would provide françoise with matter for a mental commentary as tense with passion and terror as did the silence the good humour or the arrogance of the king when a courtier or even his greatest nobles had presented a petition to him at the turning of an avenue at versailles one sunday when my aunt had received simultaneous visits from the curé and from eulalie and had been left alone afterwards to rest the whole family went upstairs to bid her good night and mamma ventured to condole with her on the unlucky coincidence that always brought both visitors to her door at the same time i hear that things went wrong again to day léonie she said kindly you have had all your friends here at once and my great aunt interrupted with too many good things for since her daughter's illness she felt herself in duty bound to revive her as far as possible by always drawing her attention to the brighter side of things but my father had begun to speak i should like to take advantage he said of the whole family's being here together to tell you a story so as not to have to begin all over again to each of you separately i am afraid we are in m legrandin's bad books he would hardly say 'how d'ye do' to me this morning i did not wait to hear the end of my father's story for i had been with him myself after mass when we had passed m legrandin instead i went downstairs to the kitchen to ask for the bill of fare for our dinner which was of fresh interest to me daily like the news in a paper and excited me as might the programme of a coming festivity as m legrandin had passed close by us on our way from church walking by the side of a lady the owner of a country house in the neighbourhood whom we knew only by sight my father had saluted him in a manner at once friendly and reserved without stopping in his walk m legrandin had barely acknowledged the courtesy and then with an air of surprise as though he had not recognised us and with that distant look characteristic of people who do not wish to be agreeable and who from the suddenly receding depths of their eyes seem to have caught sight of you at the far end of an interminably straight road and at so great a distance that they content themselves with directing towards you an almost imperceptible movement of the head in proportion to your doll like dimensions now the lady who was walking with legrandin was a model of virtue known and highly respected there could be no question of his being out for amorous adventure and annoyed at being detected and my father asked himself how he could possibly have displeased our friend i should be all the more sorry to feel that he was angry with us he said because among all those people in their sunday clothes there is something about him with his little cut away coat and his soft neckties so little 'dressed up ' so genuinely simple an air of innocence almost which is really attractive but the vote of the family council was unanimous that my father had imagined the whole thing or that legrandin at the moment in question had been preoccupied in thinking about something else anyhow my father's fears were dissipated no later than the following evening as we returned from a long walk we saw near the pont vieux legrandin himself who on account of the holidays was spending a few days more in combray he came up to us with outstretched hand do you know master book lover he asked me this line of paul desjardins now are the woods all black but still the sky is blue is not that a fine rendering of a moment like this perhaps you have never read paul desjardins read him my boy read him in these days he is converted they tell me into a preaching friar but he used to have the most charming water colour touch now are the woods all black but still the sky is blue may you always see a blue sky overhead my young friend and then even when the time comes which is coming now for me when the woods are all black when night is fast falling you will be able to console yourself as i am doing by looking up to the sky he took a cigarette from his pocket and stood for a long time his eyes fixed on the horizon goodbye friends he suddenly exclaimed and left us at the hour when i usually went downstairs to find out what there was for dinner its preparation would already have begun and françoise a colonel with all the forces of nature for her subalterns as in the fairy tales where giants hire themselves out as scullions would be stirring the coals putting the potatoes to steam and at the right moment finishing over the fire those culinary masterpieces which had been first got ready in some of the great array of vessels triumphs of the potter's craft which ranged from tubs and boilers and cauldrons and fish kettles down to jars for game moulds for pastry and tiny pannikins for cream and included an entire collection of pots and pans of every shape and size i would stop by the table where the kitchen maid had shelled them to inspect the platoons of peas drawn up in ranks and numbered like little green marbles ready for a game but what fascinated me would be the asparagus tinged with ultramarine and rosy pink which ran from their heads finely stippled in mauve and azure through a series of imperceptible changes to their white feet still stained a little by the soil of their garden bed a rainbow loveliness that was not of this world i felt that these celestial hues indicated the presence of exquisite creatures who had been pleased to assume vegetable form who through the disguise which covered their firm and edible flesh allowed me to discern in this radiance of earliest dawn these hinted rainbows these blue evening shades that precious quality which i should recognise again when all night long after a dinner at which i had partaken of them they played lyrical and coarse in their jesting as the fairies in shakespeare's dream at transforming my humble chamber into a bower of aromatic perfume poor giotto's charity as swann had named her charged by françoise with the task of preparing them for the table would have them lying beside her in a basket sitting with a mournful air as though all the sorrows of the world were heaped upon her and the light crowns of azure which capped the asparagus shoots above their pink jackets would be finely and separately outlined star by star as in giotto's fresco are the flowers banded about the brows or patterning the basket of his virtue at padua and meanwhile françoise would be turning on the spit one of those chickens such as she alone knew how to roast chickens which had wafted far abroad from combray the sweet savour of her merits and which while she was serving them to us at table would make the quality of kindness predominate for the moment in my private conception of her character the aroma of that cooked flesh which she knew how to make so unctuous and so tender seeming to me no more than the proper perfume of one of her many virtues but the day on which while my father took counsel with his family upon our strange meeting with legrandin i went down to the kitchen was one of those days when giotto's charity still very weak and ill after her recent confinement had been unable to rise from her bed françoise being without assistance had fallen into arrears when i went in i saw her in the back kitchen which opened on to the courtyard in process of killing a chicken by its desperate and quite natural resistance which françoise beside herself with rage as she attempted to slit its throat beneath the ear accompanied with shrill cries of filthy creature filthy creature it made the saintly kindness and unction of our servant rather less prominent than it would do next day at dinner when it made its appearance in a skin gold embroidered like a chasuble and its precious juice was poured out drop by drop as from a pyx when it was dead françoise mopped up its streaming blood in which however she did not let her rancour drown for she gave vent to another burst of rage and gazing down at the carcass of her enemy uttered a final filthy creature i crept out of the kitchen and upstairs trembling all over i could have prayed then for the instant dismissal of françoise but who would have baked me such hot rolls boiled me such fragrant coffee and even roasted me such chickens and as it happened everyone else had already had to make the same cowardly reckoning for my aunt léonie knew though i was still in ignorance of this that françoise who for her own daughter or for her nephews would have given her life without a murmur shewed a singular implacability in her dealings with the rest of the world in spite of which my aunt still retained her for while conscious of her cruelty she could appreciate her services i began gradually to realise that françoise's kindness her compunction the sum total of her virtues concealed many of these back kitchen tragedies just as history reveals to us that the reigns of the kings and queens who are portrayed as kneeling with clasped hands in the windows of churches were stained by oppression and bloodshed i had taken note of the fact that apart from her own kinsfolk the sufferings of humanity inspired in her a pity which increased in direct ratio to the distance separating the sufferers from herself the tears which flowed from her in torrents when she read of the misfortunes of persons unknown to her in a newspaper were quickly stemmed once she had been able to form a more accurate mental picture of the victims one night shortly after her confinement the kitchen maid was seized with the most appalling pains mamma heard her groans and rose and awakened françoise who quite unmoved declared that all the outcry was mere malingering that the girl wanted to 'play the mistress' in the house the doctor who had been afraid of some such attack had left a marker in a medical dictionary which we had at the page on which the symptoms were described and had told us to turn up this passage where we would find the measures of 'first aid' to be adopted my mother sent françoise to fetch the book warning her not to let the marker drop out an hour elapsed and françoise had not returned my mother supposing that she had gone back to bed grew vexed and told me to go myself to the bookcase and fetch the volume i did so and there found françoise who in her curiosity to know what the marker indicated had begun to read the clinical account of these after pains and was violently sobbing now that it was a question of a type of illness with which she was not familiar at each painful symptom mentioned by the writer she would exclaim oh oh holy virgin is it possible that god wishes any wretched human creature to suffer so oh the poor girl but when i had called her and she had returned to the bedside of giotto's charity her tears at once ceased to flow she could find no stimulus for that pleasant sensation of tenderness and pity which she very well knew having been moved to it often enough by the perusal of newspapers nor any other pleasure of the same kind in her sense of weariness and irritation at being pulled out of bed in the middle of the night for the kitchen maid so that at the sight of those very sufferings the printed account of which had moved her to tears she had nothing to offer but ill tempered mutterings mingled with bitter sarcasm saying when she thought that we had gone out of earshot well she need never have done what she must have done to bring all this about she found that pleasant enough i dare say she had better not put on any airs now all the same he must have been a god forsaken young man to go after that dear dear it's just as they used to say in my poor mother's country snaps and snails and puppy dogs' tails and dirty sluts in plenty smell sweeter than roses in young men's noses when the heart is one and twenty although when her grandson had a slight cold in his head she would set off at night even if she were ill also instead of going to bed to see whether he had everything that he wanted covering ten miles on foot before daybreak so as to be in time to begin her work this same love for her own people and her desire to establish the future greatness of her house on a solid foundation reacted in her policy with regard to the other servants in one unvarying maxim which was never to let any of them set foot in my aunt's room indeed she shewed a sort of pride in not allowing anyone else to come near my aunt preferring when she herself was ill to get out of bed and to administer the vichy water in person rather than to concede to the kitchen maid the right of entry into her mistress's presence there is a species of hymenoptera observed by fabre the burrowing wasp which in order to provide a supply of fresh meat for her offspring after her own decease calls in the science of anatomy to amplify the resources of her instinctive cruelty and having made a collection of weevils and spiders proceeds with marvellous knowledge and skill to pierce the nerve centre on which their power of locomotion but none of their other vital functions depends so that the paralysed insect beside which her egg is laid will furnish the larva when it is hatched with a tamed and inoffensive quarry incapable either of flight or of resistance but perfectly fresh for the larder in the same way françoise had adopted to minister to her permanent and unfaltering resolution to render the house uninhabitable to any other servant a series of crafty and pitiless stratagems many years later we discovered that if we had been fed on asparagus day after day throughout that whole season it was because the smell of the plants gave the poor kitchen maid who had to prepare them such violent attacks of asthma that she was finally obliged to leave my aunt's service alas we had definitely to alter our opinion of m legrandin on one of the sundays following our meeting with him on the pont vieux after which my father had been forced to confess himself mistaken as mass drew to an end and with the sunshine and the noise of the outer world something else invaded the church an atmosphere so far from sacred that mme goupil mme percepied all those in fact who a moment ago when i arrived a little late had been sitting motionless their eyes fixed on their prayer books who i might even have thought had not seen me come in had not their feet moved slightly to push away the little kneeling desk which was preventing me from getting to my chair began in loud voices to discuss with us all manner of utterly mundane topics as though we were already outside in the square we saw standing on the sun baked steps of the porch dominating the many coloured tumult of the market legrandin himself whom the husband of the lady we had seen with him on the previous occasion was just going to introduce to the wife of another large landed proprietor of the district legrandin's face shewed an extraordinary zeal and animation he made a profound bow with a subsidiary backward movement which brought his spine sharply up into a position behind its starting point a gesture in which he must have been trained by the husband of his sister mme de cambremer this rapid recovery caused a sort of tense muscular wave to ripple over legrandin's hips which i had not supposed to be so fleshy i cannot say why but this undulation of pure matter this wholly carnal fluency with not the least hint in it of spiritual significance this wave lashed to a fury by the wind of an assiduity an obsequiousness of the basest sort awoke my mind suddenly to the possibility of a legrandin altogether different from the one whom we knew the lady gave him some message for her coachman and while he was stepping down to her carriage the impression of joy timid and devout which the introduction had stamped there still lingered on his face carried away in a sort of dream he smiled then he began to hurry back towards the lady he was walking faster than usual and his shoulders swayed backwards and forwards right and left in the most absurd fashion altogether he looked so utterly had he abandoned himself to it ignoring all other considerations as though he were the lifeless and wire pulled puppet of his own happiness meanwhile we were coming out through the porch we were passing close beside him he was too well bred to turn his head away but he fixed his eyes which had suddenly changed to those of a seer lost in the profundity of his vision on so distant a point of the horizon that he could not see us and so had not to acknowledge our presence his face emerged still with an air of innocence from his straight and pliant coat which looked as though conscious of having been led astray in spite of itself and plunged into surroundings of a detested splendour and a spotted necktie stirred by the breezes of the square continued to float in front of legrandin like the standard of his proud isolation of his noble independence just as we reached the house my mother discovered that we had forgotten the 'saint honoré ' and asked my father to go back with me and tell them to send it up at once near the church we met legrandin coming towards us with the same lady whom he was escorting to her carriage he brushed past us and did not interrupt what he was saying to her but gave us out of the corner of his blue eye a little sign which began and ended so to speak inside his eyelids and as it did not involve the least movement of his facial muscles managed to pass quite unperceived by the lady but striving to compensate by the intensity of his feelings for the somewhat restricted field in which they had to find expression he made that blue chink which was set apart for us sparkle with all the animation of cordiality which went far beyond mere playfulness and almost touched the border line of roguery he subtilised the refinements of good fellowship into a wink of connivance a hint a hidden meaning a secret understanding all the mysteries of complicity in a plot and finally exalted his assurances of friendship to the level of protestations of affection even of a declaration of love lighting up for us and for us alone with a secret and languid flame invisible by the great lady upon his other side an enamoured pupil in a countenance of ice only the day before he had asked my parents to send me to dine with him on this same sunday evening come and bear your aged friend company he had said to me like the nosegay which a traveller sends us from some land to which we shall never go again come and let me breathe from the far country of your adolescence the scent of those flowers of spring among which i also used to wander many years ago come with the primrose with the canon's beard with the gold cup come with the stone crop whereof are posies made pledges of love in the balzacian flora come with that flower of the resurrection morning the easter daisy come with the snowballs of the guelder rose which begin to embalm with their fragrance the alleys of your great aunt's garden ere the last snows of lent are melted from its soil come with the glorious silken raiment of the lily apparel fit for solomon and with the many coloured enamel of the pansies but come above all with the spring breeze still cooled by the last frosts of winter wafting apart for the two butterflies' sake that have waited outside all morning the closed portals of the first jerusalem rose the question was raised at home whether all things considered i ought still to be sent to dine with m legrandin but my grandmother refused to believe that he could have been impolite you admit yourself that he appears at church there quite simply dressed and all that he hardly looks like a man of fashion she added that in any event even if at the worst he had been intentionally rude it was far better for us to pretend that we had noticed nothing and indeed my father himself though more annoyed than any of us by the attitude which legrandin had adopted may still have held in reserve a final uncertainty as to its true meaning it was like every attitude or action which reveals a man's deep and hidden character they bear no relation to what he has previously said and we cannot confirm our suspicions by the culprit's evidence for he will admit nothing we are reduced to the evidence of our own senses and we ask ourselves in the face of this detached and incoherent fragment of recollection whether indeed our senses have not been the victims of a hallucination with the result that such attitudes and these alone are of importance in indicating character are the most apt to leave us in perplexity i dined with legrandin on the terrace of his house by moonlight there is a charming quality is there not he said to me in this silence for hearts that are wounded as mine is a novelist whom you will read in time to come claims that there is no remedy but silence and shadow and see you this my boy there comes in all lives a time towards which you still have far to go when the weary eyes can endure but one kind of light the light which a fine evening like this prepares for us in the stillroom of darkness when the ears can listen to no music save what the moonlight breathes through the flute of silence i could hear what m legrandin was saying like everything that he said it sounded attractive but i was disturbed by the memory of a lady whom i had seen recently for the first time and thinking now that i knew that legrandin was on friendly terms with several of the local aristocracy that perhaps she also was among his acquaintance i summoned up all my courage and said to him tell me sir do you by any chance know the lady the ladies of guermantes and i felt glad because in pronouncing the name i had secured a sort of power over it by the mere act of drawing it up out of my dreams and giving it an objective existence in the world of spoken things but at the sound of the word guermantes i saw in the middle of each of our friend's blue eyes a little brown dimple appear as though they had been stabbed by some invisible pin point while the rest of his pupils reacting from the shock received and secreted the azure overflow his fringed eyelids darkened and drooped his mouth which had been stiffened and seared with bitter lines was the first to recover and smiled while his eyes still seemed full of pain like the eyes of a good looking martyr whose body bristles with arrows no i do not know them he said but instead of uttering so simple a piece of information a reply in which there was so little that could astonish me in the natural and conversational tone which would have befitted it he recited it with a separate stress upon each word leaning forward bowing his head with at once the vehemence which a man gives so as to be believed to a highly improbable statement as though the fact that he did not know the guermantes could be due only to some strange accident of fortune and with the emphasis of a man who finding himself unable to keep silence about what is to him a painful situation chooses to proclaim it aloud so as to convince his hearers that the confession he is making is one that causes him no embarrassment but is easy agreeable spontaneous that the situation in question in this case the absence of relations with the guermantes family might very well have been not forced upon but actually designed by legrandin himself might arise from some family tradition some moral principle or mystical vow which expressly forbade his seeking their society no he resumed explaining by his words the tone in which they were uttered no i do not know them i have never wished to know them i have always made a point of preserving complete independence at heart as you know i am a bit of a radical people are always coming to me about it telling me i am mistaken in not going to guermantes that i make myself seem ill bred uncivilised an old bear but that's not the sort of reputation that can frighten me it's too true in my heart of hearts i care for nothing in the world now but a few churches books two or three pictures rather more perhaps and the light of the moon when the fresh breeze of youth such as yours wafts to my nostrils the scent of gardens whose flowers my old eyes are not sharp enough now to distinguish i did not understand very clearly why in order to refrain from going to the houses of people whom one did not know it should be necessary to cling to one's independence nor how that could give one the appearance of a savage or a bear but what i did understand was this that legrandin was not altogether truthful when he said that he cared only for churches moonlight and youth he cared also he cared a very great deal for people who lived in country houses and would be so much afraid when in their company of incurring their displeasure that he would never dare to let them see that he numbered as well among his friends middle class people the families of solicitors and stockbrokers preferring if the truth must be known that it should be revealed in his absence when he was out of earshot that judgment should go against him if so it must by default in a word he was a snob of course he would never have admitted all or any of this in the poetical language which my family and i so much admired and if i asked him do you know the guermantes family legrandin the talker would reply no i have never cared to know them but unfortunately the talker was now subordinated to another legrandin whom he kept carefully hidden in his breast whom he would never consciously exhibit because this other could tell stories about our own legrandin and about his snobbishness which would have ruined his reputation for ever and this other legrandin had replied to me already in that wounded look that stiffened smile the undue gravity of his tone in uttering those few words in the thousand arrows by which our own legrandin had instantaneously been stabbed and sickened like a saint sebastian of snobbery oh how you hurt me no i do not know the guermantes family do not remind me of the great sorrow of my life and since this other this irrepressible dominant despotic legrandin if he lacked our legrandin's charming vocabulary shewed an infinitely greater promptness in expressing himself by means of what are called 'reflexes ' it followed that when legrandin the talker attempted to silence him he would already have spoken and it would be useless for our friend to deplore the bad impression which the revelations of his alter ego must have caused since he could do no more now than endeavour to mitigate them this was not to say that m legrandin was anything but sincere when he inveighed against snobs he could not from his own knowledge at least be aware that he was one also since it is only with the passions of others that we are ever really familiar and what we come to find out about our own can be no more than what other people have shewn us upon ourselves they react but indirectly through our imagination which substitutes for our actual primary motives other secondary motives less stark and therefore more decent never had legrandin's snobbishness impelled him to make a habit of visiting a duchess as such instead it would set his imagination to make that duchess appear in legrandin's eyes endowed with all the graces he would be drawn towards the duchess assuring himself the while that he was yielding to the attractions of her mind and her other virtues which the vile race of snobs could never understand only his fellow snobs knew that he was of their number for owing to their inability to appreciate the intervening efforts of his imagination they saw in close juxtaposition the social activities of legrandin and their primary cause at home meanwhile we had no longer any illusions as to m legrandin and our relations with him had become much more distant mamma would be greatly delighted whenever she caught him red handed in the sin which he continued to call the unpardonable sin of snobbery as for my father he found it difficult to take legrandin's airs in so light in so detached a spirit and when there was some talk one year of sending me to spend the long summer holidays at balbec with my grandmother he said i must most certainly tell legrandin that you are going to balbec to see whether he will offer you an introduction to his sister he probably doesn't remember telling us that she lived within a mile of the place my grandmother who held that when one went to the seaside one ought to be on the beach from morning to night to taste the salt breezes and that one should not know anyone in the place because calls and parties and excursions were so much time stolen from what belonged by rights to the sea air begged him on no account to speak to legrandin of our plans for already in her mind's eye she could see his sister mme de cambremer alighting from her carriage at the door of our hotel just as we were on the point of going out fishing and obliging us to remain indoors all afternoon to entertain her but mamma laughed her fears to scorn for she herself felt that the danger was not so threatening and that legrandin would shew no undue anxiety to make us acquainted with his sister and as it happened there was no need for any of us to introduce the subject of balbec for it was legrandin himself who without the least suspicion that we had ever had any intention of visiting those parts walked into the trap uninvited one evening when we met him strolling on the banks of the vivonne there are tints in the clouds this evening violets and blues which are very beautiful are they not my friend he said to my father especially a blue which is far more floral than atmospheric a cineraria blue which it is surprising to see in the sky and that little pink cloud there has it not just the tint of some flower a carnation or hydrangea nowhere perhaps except on the shores of the english channel where normandy merges into brittany have i been able to find such copious examples of what you might call a vegetable kingdom in the clouds down there close to balbec among all those places which are still so uncivilised there is a little bay charmingly quiet where the sunsets of the auge valley those red and gold sunsets which all the same i am very far from despising seem commonplace and insignificant for in that moist and gentle atmosphere these heavenly flower beds will break into blossom in a few moments in the evenings incomparably lovely and often lasting for hours before they fade others shed their leaves at once and then it is more beautiful still to see the sky strewn with the scattering of their innumerable petals sulphurous yellow and rosy red in that bay which they call the opal bay the golden sands appear more charming still from being fastened like fair andromeda to those terrible rocks of the surrounding coast to that funereal shore famed for the number of its wrecks where every winter many a brave vessel falls a victim to the perils of the sea balbec the oldest bone in the geological skeleton that underlies our soil the true armor the sea the land's end the accursed region which anatole france an enchanter whose works our young friend ought to read has so well depicted beneath its eternal fogs as though it were indeed the land of the cimmerians in the odyssey balbec yes they are building hotels there now superimposing them upon its ancient and charming soil which they are powerless to alter how delightful it is down there to be able to step out at once into regions so primitive and so entrancing indeed and do you know anyone at balbec inquired my father this young man is just going to spend a couple of months there with his grandmother and my wife too perhaps legrandin taken unawares by the question at a moment when he was looking directly at my father was unable to turn aside his gaze and so concentrated it with steadily increasing intensity smiling mournfully the while upon the eyes of his questioner with an air of friendliness and frankness and of not being afraid to look him in the face until he seemed to have penetrated my father's skull as it had been a ball of glass and to be seeing at the moment a long way beyond and behind it a brightly coloured cloud which provided him with a mental alibi and would enable him to establish the theory that just when he was being asked whether he knew anyone at balbec he had been thinking of something else and so had not heard the question as a rule these tactics make the questioner proceed to ask why what are you thinking about but my father inquisitive annoyed and cruel repeated have you friends then in that neighbourhood that you know balbec so well in a final and desperate effort the smiling gaze of legrandin struggled to the extreme limits of its tenderness vagueness candour and distraction then feeling no doubt that there was nothing left for it now but to answer he said to us i have friends all the world over wherever there are companies of trees stricken but not defeated which have come together to offer a common supplication with pathetic obstinacy to an inclement sky which has no mercy upon them that is not quite what i meant interrupted my father obstinate as a tree and merciless as the sky i asked you in case anything should happen to my mother in law and she wanted to feel that she was not all alone down there at the ends of the earth whether you knew any of the people there as elsewhere i know everyone and i know no one replied legrandin who was by no means ready yet to surrender places i know well people very slightly but down there the places themselves seem to me just like people rare and wonderful people of a delicate quality which would have been corrupted and ruined by the gift of life perhaps it is a castle which you encounter upon the cliff's edge standing there by the roadside where it has halted to contemplate its sorrows before an evening sky still rosy through which a golden moon is climbing while the fishing boats homeward bound creasing the watered silk of the channel hoist its pennant at their mastheads and carry its colours or perhaps it is a simple dwelling house that stands alone ugly if anything timid seeming but full of romance hiding from every eye some imperishable secret of happiness and disenchantment that land which knows not truth he continued with machiavellian subtlety that land of infinite fiction makes bad reading for any boy and is certainly not what i should choose or recommend for my young friend here who is already so much inclined to melancholy for a heart already predisposed to receive its impressions climates that breathe amorous secrets and futile regrets may agree with an old and disillusioned man like myself but they must always prove fatal to a temperament which is still unformed believe me he went on with emphasis the waters of that bay more breton than norman may exert a sedative influence though even that is of questionable value upon a heart which like mine is no longer unbroken a heart for whose wounds there is no longer anything to compensate but at your age my boy those waters are contra indicated good night to you neighbours he added moving away from us with that evasive abruptness to which we were accustomed and then turning towards us with a physicianly finger raised in warning he resumed the consultation no balbec before you are fifty he called out to me and even then it must depend on the state of the heart my father spoke to him of it again as often as we met him and tortured him with questions but it was labour in vain like that scholarly swindler who devoted to the fabrication of forged palimpsests a wealth of skill and knowledge and industry the hundredth part of which would have sufficed to establish him in a more lucrative but an honourable occupation m legrandin had we insisted further would in the end have constructed a whole system of ethics and a celestial geography of lower normandy sooner than admit to us that within a mile of balbec his own sister was living in her own house sooner than find himself obliged to offer us a letter of introduction the prospect of which would never have inspired him with such terror had he been absolutely certain as from his knowledge of my grandmother's character he really ought to have been certain that in no circumstances whatsoever would we have dreamed of making use of it we used always to return from our walks in good time to pay aunt léonie a visit before dinner in the first weeks of our combray holidays when the days ended early we would still be able to see as we turned into the rue du saint esprit a reflection of the western sky from the windows of the house and a band of purple at the foot of the calvary which was mirrored further on in the pond a fiery glow which accompanied often by a cold that burned and stung would associate itself in my mind with the glow of the fire over which at that very moment was roasting the chicken that was to furnish me in place of the poetic pleasure i had found in my walk with the sensual pleasures of good feeding warmth and rest but in summer when we came back to the house the sun would not have set and while we were upstairs paying our visit to aunt léonie its rays sinking until they touched and lay along her window sill would there be caught and held by the large inner curtains and the bands which tied them back to the wall and split and scattered and filtered and then at last would fall upon and inlay with tiny flakes of gold the lemonwood of her chest of drawers illuminating the room in their passage with the same delicate slanting shadowed beams that fall among the boles of forest trees but on some days though very rarely the chest of drawers would long since have shed its momentary adornments there would no longer as we turned into the rue du saint esprit be any reflection from the western sky burning along the line of window panes the pond beneath the calvary would have lost its fiery glow sometimes indeed had changed already to an opalescent pallor while a long ribbon of moonlight bent and broken and broadened by every ripple upon the water's surface would be lying across it from end to end then as we drew near the house we would make out a figure standing upon the doorstep and mamma would say to me good heavens there is françoise looking out for us your aunt must be anxious that means we are late and without wasting time by stopping to take off our 'things' we would fly upstairs to my aunt léonie's room to reassure her to prove to her by our bodily presence that all her gloomy imaginings were false that on the contrary nothing had happened to us but that we had gone the 'guermantes way ' and good lord when one took that walk my aunt knew well enough that one could never say at what time one would be home there françoise my aunt would say didn't i tell you that they must have gone the guermantes way good gracious they must be hungry and your nice leg of mutton will be quite dried up now after all the hours it's been waiting what a time to come in well and so you went the guermantes way but leonie i supposed you knew mamma would answer i thought that françoise had seen us go out by the little gate through the kitchen garden for there were in the environs of combray two 'ways' which we used to take for our walks and so diametrically opposed that we would actually leave the house by a different door according to the way we had chosen the way towards méséglise la vineuse which we called also 'swann's way ' because to get there one had to pass along the boundary of m swann's estate and the 'guermantes way ' of méséglise la vineuse to tell the truth i never knew anything more than the way there and the strange people who would come over on sundays to take the air in combray people whom this time neither my aunt nor any of us would 'know at all ' and whom we would therefore assume to be 'people who must have come over from méséglise ' as for guermantes i was to know it well enough one day but that day had still to come and during the whole of my boyhood if méséglise was to me something as inaccessible as the horizon which remained hidden from sight however far one went by the folds of a country which no longer bore the least resemblance to the country round combray guermantes on the other hand meant no more than the ultimate goal ideal rather than real of the 'guermantes way ' a sort of abstract geographical term like the north pole or the equator and so to 'take the guermantes way' in order to get to méséglise or vice versa would have seemed to me as nonsensical a proceeding as to turn to the east in order to reach the west since my father used always to speak of the 'méséglise way' as comprising the finest view of a plain that he knew anywhere and of the 'guermantes way' as typical of river scenery i had invested each of them by conceiving them in this way as two distinct entities with that cohesion that unity which belongs only to the figments of the mind the smallest detail of either of them appeared to me as a precious thing which exhibited the special excellence of the whole while immediately beside them in the first stages of our walk before we had reached the sacred soil of one or the other the purely material roads at definite points on which they were set down as the ideal view over a plain and the ideal scenery of a river were no more worth the trouble of looking at them than to a keen playgoer and lover of dramatic art are the little streets which may happen to run past the walls of a theatre but above all i set between them far more distinctly than the mere distance in miles and yards and inches which separated one from the other the distance that there was between the two parts of my brain in which i used to think of them one of those distances of the mind which time serves only to lengthen which separate things irremediably from one another keeping them for ever upon different planes and this distinction was rendered still more absolute because the habit we had of never going both ways on the same day or in the course of the same walk but the 'méséglise way' one time and the 'guermantes way' another shut them up so to speak far apart and unaware of each other's existence in the sealed vessels between which there could be no communication of separate afternoons when we had decided to go the 'méséglise way' we would start without undue haste and even if the sky were clouded over since the walk was not very long and did not take us too far from home as though we were not going anywhere in particular by the front door of my aunt's house which opened on to the rue du saint esprit we would be greeted by the gunsmith we would drop our letters into the box we would tell théodore from françoise as we passed that she had run out of oil or coffee and we would leave the town by the road which ran along the white fence of m swann's park before reaching it we would be met on our way by the scent of his lilac trees come out to welcome strangers out of the fresh little green hearts of their foliage the lilacs raised inquisitively over the fence of the park their plumes of white or purple blossom which glowed even in the shade with the sunlight in which they had been bathed some of them half concealed by the little tiled house called the archers' lodge in which swann's keeper lived overtopped its gothic gable with their rosy minaret the nymphs of spring would have seemed coarse and vulgar in comparison with these young houris who retained in this french garden the pure and vivid colouring of a persian miniature despite my desire to throw my arms about their pliant forms and to draw down towards me the starry locks that crowned their fragrant heads we would pass them by without stopping for my parents had ceased to visit tansonville since swann's marriage and so as not to appear to be looking into his park we would instead of taking the road which ran beside its boundary and then climbed straight up to the open fields choose another way which led in the same direction but circuitously and brought us out rather too far from home one day my grandfather said to my 'father don't you remember swann's telling us yesterday that his wife and daughter had gone off to rheims and that he was taking the opportunity of spending a day or two in paris we might go along by the park since the ladies are not at home that will make it a little shorter we stopped for a moment by the fence lilac time was nearly over some of the trees still thrust aloft in tall purple chandeliers their tiny balls of blossom but in many places among their foliage where only a week before they had still been breaking in waves of fragrant foam these were now spent and shrivelled and discoloured a hollow scum dry and scentless my grandfather pointed out to my father in what respects the appearance of the place was still the same and how far it had altered since the walk that he had taken with old m swann on the day of his wife's death and he seized the opportunity to tell us once again the story of that walk in front of us a path bordered with nasturtiums rose in the full glare of the sun towards the house but to our right the park stretched away into the distance on level ground overshadowed by the tall trees which stood close around it an 'ornamental water' had been constructed by swann's parents but even in his most artificial creations nature is the material upon which man has to work certain spots will persist in remaining surrounded by the vassals of their own especial sovereignty and will raise their immemorial standards among all the 'laid out' scenery of a park just as they would have done far from any human interference in a solitude which must everywhere return to engulf them springing up out of the necessities of their exposed position and superimposing itself upon the work of man's hands and so it was that at the foot of the path which led down to this artificial lake there might be seen in its two tiers woven of trailing forget me nots below and of periwinkle flowers above the natural delicate blue garland which binds the luminous shadowed brows of water nymphs while the iris its swords sweeping every way in regal profusion stretched out over agrimony and water growing king cups the lilied sceptres tattered glories of yellow and purple of the kingdom of the lake the absence of mlle swann which since it preserved me from the terrible risk of seeing her appear on one of the paths and of being identified and scorned by this so privileged little girl who had bergotte for a friend and used to go with him to visit cathedrals made the exploration of tansonville now for the first time permitted me a matter of indifference to myself seemed however to invest the property in my grandfather's and father's eyes with a fresh and transient charm and like an entirely cloudless sky when one is going mountaineering to make the day extraordinarily propitious for a walk in this direction i should have liked to see their reckoning proved false to see by a miracle mlle swann appear with her father so close to us that we should not have time to escape and should therefore be obliged to make her acquaintance and so when i suddenly noticed a straw basket lying forgotten on the grass by the side of a line whose float was bobbing in the water i made a great effort to keep my father and grandfather looking in another direction away from this sign that she might after all be in residence still as swann had told us that he ought not really to go away just then as he had some people staying in the house the line might equally belong to one of these guests not a footstep was to be heard on any of the paths somewhere in one of the tall trees making a stage in its height an invisible bird desperately attempting to make the day seem shorter was exploring with a long continuous note the solitude that pressed it on every side but it received at once so unanimous an answer so powerful a repercussion of silence and of immobility that one would have said it had arrested for all eternity the moment which it had been trying to make pass more quickly the sunlight fell so implacably from a fixed sky that one was naturally inclined to slip away out of the reach of its attentions and even the slumbering water whose repose was perpetually being invaded by the insects that swarmed above its surface while it dreamed no doubt of some imaginary maelstrom intensified the uneasiness which the sight of that floating cork had wrought in me by appearing to draw it at full speed across the silent reaches of a mirrored firmament now almost vertical it seemed on the point of plunging down out of sight and i had begun to ask myself whether setting aside the longing and the terror that i had of making her acquaintance it was not actually my duty to warn mlle swann that the fish was biting when i was obliged to run after my father and grandfather who were calling me and were surprised that i had not followed them along the little path climbing up hill towards the open fields into which they had already turned i found the whole path throbbing with the fragrance of hawthorn blossom the hedge resembled a series of chapels whose walls were no longer visible under the mountains of flowers that were heaped upon their altars while underneath the sun cast a square of light upon the ground as though it had shone in upon them through a window the scent that swept out over me from them was as rich and as circumscribed in its range as though i had been standing before the lady altar and the flowers themselves adorned also held out each its little bunch of glittering stamens with an air of inattention fine radiating 'nerves' in the flamboyant style of architecture like those which in church framed the stair to the rood loft or closed the perpendicular tracery of the windows but here spread out into pools of fleshy white like strawberry beds in spring how simple and rustic in comparison with these would seem the dog roses which in a few weeks' time would be climbing the same hillside path in the heat of the sun dressed in the smooth silk of their blushing pink bodices which would be undone and scattered by the first breath of wind but it was in vain that i lingered before the hawthorns to breathe in to marshal before my mind which knew not what to make of it to lose in order to rediscover their invisible and unchanging odour to absorb myself in the rhythm which disposed their flowers here and there with the light heartedness of youth and at intervals as unexpected as certain intervals of music they offered me an indefinite continuation of the same charm in an inexhaustible profusion but without letting me delve into it any more deeply like those melodies which one can play over a hundred times in succession without coming any nearer to their secret i turned away from them for a moment so as to be able to return to them with renewed strength my eyes followed up the slope which outside the hedge rose steeply to the fields a poppy that had strayed and been lost by its fellows or a few cornflowers that had fallen lazily behind and decorated the ground here and there with their flowers like the border of a tapestry in which may be seen at intervals hints of the rustic theme which appears triumphant in the panel itself infrequent still spaced apart as the scattered houses which warn us that we are approaching a village they betokened to me the vast expanse of waving corn beneath the fleecy clouds and the sight of a single poppy hoisting upon its slender rigging and holding against the breeze its scarlet ensign over the buoy of rich black earth from which it sprang made my heart beat as does a wayfarer's when he perceives upon some low lying ground an old and broken boat which is being caulked and made seaworthy and cries out although he has not yet caught sight of it the sea and then i returned to my hawthorns and stood before them as one stands before those masterpieces of painting which one imagines one will be better able to 'take in' when one has looked away for a moment at something else but in vain did i shape my fingers into a frame so as to have nothing but the hawthorns before my eyes the sentiment which they aroused in me remained obscure and vague struggling and failing to free itself to float across and become one with the flowers they themselves offered me no enlightenment and i could not call upon any other flowers to satisfy this mysterious longing and then inspiring me with that rapture which we feel on seeing a work by our favourite painter quite different from any of those that we already know or better still when some one has taken us and set us down in front of a picture of which we have hitherto seen no more than a pencilled sketch or when a piece of music which we have heard played over on the piano bursts out again in our ears with all the splendour and fullness of an orchestra my grandfather called me to him and pointing to the hedge of tansonville said you are fond of hawthorns just look at this pink one isn't it pretty and it was indeed a hawthorn but one whose flowers were pink and lovelier even than the white it too was in holiday attire for one of those days which are the only true holidays the holy days of religion because they are not appointed by any capricious accident as secular holidays are appointed upon days which are not specially ordained for such observances which have nothing about them that is essentially festal but it was attired even more richly than the rest for the flowers which clung to its branches one above another so thickly as to leave no part of the tree undecorated like the tassels wreathed about the crook of a rococo shepherdess were every one of them 'in colour ' and consequently of a superior quality by the aesthetic standards of combray to the 'plain ' if one was to judge by the scale of prices at the 'stores' in the square or at camus's where the most expensive biscuits were those whose sugar was pink and for my own part i set a higher value on cream cheese when it was pink when i had been allowed to tinge it with crushed strawberries and these flowers had chosen precisely the colour of some edible and delicious thing or of some exquisite addition to one's costume for a great festival which colours inasmuch as they make plain the reason for their superiority are those whose beauty is most evident to the eyes of children and for that reason must always seem more vivid and more natural than any other tints even after the child's mind has realised that they offer no gratification to the appetite and have not been selected by the dressmaker and indeed i had felt at once as i had felt before the white blossom but now still more marvelling that it was in no artificial manner by no device of human construction that the festal intention of these flowers was revealed but that it was nature herself who had spontaneously expressed it with the simplicity of a woman from a village shop labouring at the decoration of a street altar for some procession by burying the bush in these little rosettes almost too ravishing in colour this rustic 'pompadour ' high up on the branches like so many of those tiny rose trees their pots concealed in jackets of paper lace whose slender stems rise in a forest from the altar on the greater festivals a thousand buds were swelling and opening paler in colour but each disclosing as it burst as at the bottom of a cup of pink marble its blood red stain and suggesting even more strongly than the full blown flowers the special irresistible quality of the hawthorn tree which wherever it budded wherever it was about to blossom could bud and blossom in pink flowers alone taking its place in the hedge but as different from the rest as a young girl in holiday attire among a crowd of dowdy women in everyday clothes who are staying at home equipped and ready for the 'month of mary ' of which it seemed already to form a part it shone and smiled in its cool rosy garments a catholic bush indeed and altogether delightful the hedge allowed us a glimpse inside the park of an alley bordered with jasmine pansies and verbenas among which the stocks held open their fresh plump purses of a pink as fragrant and as faded as old spanish leather while on the gravel path a long watering pipe painted green coiling across the ground poured where its holes were over the flowers whose perfume those holes inhaled a vertical and prismatic fan of infinitesimal rainbow coloured drops suddenly i stood still unable to move as happens when something appears that requires not only our eyes to take it in but involves a deeper kind of perception and takes possession of the whole of our being a little girl with fair reddish hair who appeared to be returning from a walk and held a trowel in her hand was looking at us raising towards us a face powdered with pinkish freckles her black eyes gleamed and as i did not at that time know and indeed have never since learned how to reduce to its objective elements any strong impression since i had not as they say enough 'power of observation' to isolate the sense of their colour for a long time afterwards whenever i thought of her the memory of those bright eyes would at once present itself to me as a vivid azure since her complexion was fair so much so that perhaps if her eyes had not been quite so black which was what struck one most forcibly on first meeting her i should not have been as i was especially enamoured of their imagined blue i gazed at her at first with that gaze which is not merely a messenger from the eyes but in whose window all the senses assemble and lean out petrified and anxious that gaze which would fain reach touch capture bear off in triumph the body at which it is aimed and the soul with the body then so frightened was i lest at any moment my grandfather and father catching sight of the girl might tear me away from her by making me run on in front of them with another an unconsciously appealing look whose object was to force her to pay attention to me to see to know me she cast a glance forwards and sideways so as to take stock of my grandfather and father and doubtless the impression she formed of them was that we were all absurd people for she turned away with an indifferent and contemptuous air withdrew herself so as to spare her face the indignity of remaining within their field of vision and while they continuing to walk on without noticing her had overtaken and passed me she allowed her eyes to wander over the space that lay between us in my direction without any particular expression without appearing to have seen me but with an intensity a half hidden smile which i was unable to interpret according to the instruction i had received in the ways of good breeding save as a mark of infinite disgust and her hand at the same time sketched in the air an indelicate gesture for which when it was addressed in public to a person whom one did not know the little dictionary of manners which i carried in my mind supplied only one meaning namely a deliberate insult gilberte come along what are you doing called out in a piercing tone of authority a lady in white whom i had not seen until that moment while a little way beyond her a gentleman in a suit of linen 'ducks ' whom i did not know either stared at me with eyes which seemed to be starting from his head the little girl's smile abruptly faded and seizing her trowel she made off without turning to look again in my direction with an air of obedience inscrutable and sly and so was wafted to my ears the name of gilberte bestowed on me like a talisman which might perhaps enable me some day to rediscover her whom its syllables had just endowed with a definite personality whereas a moment earlier she had been only something vaguely seen so it came to me uttered across the heads of the stocks and jasmines pungent and cool as the drops which fell from the green watering pipe impregnating and irradiating the zone of pure air through which it had passed which it set apart and isolated from all other air with the mystery of the life of her whom its syllables designated to the happy creatures that lived and walked and travelled in her company unfolding through the arch of the pink hawthorn which opened at the height of my shoulder the quintessence of their familiarity so exquisitely painful to myself with her and with all that unknown world of her existence into which i should never penetrate for a moment while we moved away and my grandfather murmured poor swann what a life they are leading him fancy sending him away so that she can be left alone with her charlus for that was charlus i recognised him at once and the child too at her age to be mixed up in all that the impression left on me by the despotic tone in which gilberte's mother had spoken to her without her replying by exhibiting her to me as being obliged to yield obedience to some one else as not being indeed superior to the whole world calmed my sufferings somewhat revived some hope in me and cooled the ardour of my love but very soon that love surged up again in me like a reaction by which my humiliated heart was endeavouring to rise to gilberte's level or to draw her down to its own i loved her i was sorry not to have had the time and the inspiration to insult her to do her some injury to force her to keep some memory of me i knew her to be so beautiful that i should have liked to be able to retrace my steps so as to shake my fist at her and shout i think you are hideous grotesque you are utterly disgusting however i walked away carrying with me then and for ever afterwards as the first illustration of a type of happiness rendered inaccessible to a little boy of my kind by certain laws of nature which it was impossible to transgress the picture of a little girl with reddish hair and a skin freckled with tiny pink marks who held a trowel in her hand and smiled as she directed towards me a long and subtle and inexpressive stare and already the charm with which her name like a cloud of incense had filled that archway in the pink hawthorn through which she and i had together heard its sound was beginning to conquer to cover to embalm to beautify everything with which it had any association her grandparents whom my own had been so unspeakably fortunate as to know the glorious profession of a stockholder even the melancholy neighbourhood of the champs elysées where she lived in paris léonie said my grandfather on our return i wish we had had you with us this afternoon you would never have known tansonville if i had had the courage i would have cut you a branch of that pink hawthorn you used to like so much and so my grandfather told her the story of our walk either just to amuse her or perhaps because there was still some hope that she might be stimulated to rise from her bed and to go out of doors for in earlier days she had been very fond of tansonville and moreover swann's visits had been the last that she had continued to receive at a time when she had already closed her doors to all the world and just as when he called in these later days to inquire for her and she was still the only person in our household whom he would ask to see she would send down to say that she was tired at the moment and resting but that she would be happy to see him another time so this evening she said to my grandfather yes some day when the weather is fine i shall go for a drive as far as the gate of the park and in saying this she was quite sincere she would have liked to see swann and tansonville again but the mere wish to do so sufficed for all that remained of her strength which its fulfilment would have more than exhausted sometimes a spell of fine weather made her a little more energetic she would rise and put on her clothes but before she had reached the outer room she would be 'tired' again and would insist on returning to her bed the process which had begun in her and in her a little earlier only than it must come to all of us was the great and general renunciation which old age makes in preparation for death the chrysalis stage of life which may be observed wherever life has been unduly prolonged even in old lovers who have lived for one another with the utmost intensity of passion and in old friends bound by the closest ties of mental sympathy who after a certain year cease to make the necessary journey or even to cross the street to see one another cease to correspond and know well that they will communicate no more in this world my aunt must have been perfectly well aware that she would not see swann again that she would never leave her own house any more but this ultimate seclusion seemed to be accepted by her with all the more readiness for the very reason which to our minds ought to have made it more unbearable namely that such a seclusion was forced upon her by the gradual and steady diminution in her strength which she was able to measure daily which by making every action every movement 'tiring' to her if not actually painful gave to inaction isolation and silence the blessed strengthening and refreshing charm of repose my aunt did not go to see the pink hawthorn in the hedge but at all hours of the day i would ask the rest of my family whether she was not going to go whether she used not at one time to go often to tansonville trying to make them speak of mlle swann's parents and grandparents who appeared to me to be as great and glorious as gods the name which had for me become almost mythological of swann when i talked with my family i would grow sick with longing to hear them utter it i dared not pronounce it myself but i would draw them into a discussion of matters which led naturally to gilberte and her family in which she was involved in speaking of which i would feel myself not too remotely banished from her company and i would suddenly force my father by pretending for instance to believe that my grandfather's business had been in our family before his day or that the hedge with the pink hawthorn which my aunt léonie wished to visit was on common ground to correct my statements to say as though in opposition to me and of his own accord no no the business belonged to swann's father that hedge is part of swann's park and then i would be obliged to pause for breath so stifling was the pressure upon that part of me where it was for ever inscribed of that name which at the moment when i heard it seemed to me fuller more portentous than any other name because it was burdened with the weight of all the occasions on which i had secretly uttered it in my mind it caused me a pleasure which i was ashamed to have dared to demand from my parents for so great was it that to have procured it for me must have involved them in an immensity of effort and with no recompense since for them there was no pleasure in the sound and so i would prudently turn the conversation and by a scruple of conscience also all the singular seductions which i had stored up in the sound of that word swann i found again as soon as it was uttered and then it occurred to me suddenly that my parents could not fail to experience the same emotions that they must find themselves sharing my point of view that they perceived in their turn that they condoned that they even embraced my visionary longings and i was as wretched as though i had ravished and corrupted the innocence of their hearts that year my family fixed the day of their return to paris rather earlier than usual on the morning of our departure i had had my hair curled to be ready to face the photographer had had a new hat carefully set upon my head and had been buttoned into a velvet jacket a little later my mother after searching everywhere for me found me standing in tears on that steep little hillside close to tansonville bidding a long farewell to my hawthorns clasping their sharp branches to my bosom and like a princess in a tragedy oppressed by the weight of all her senseless jewellery with no gratitude towards the officious hand which had in curling those ringlets been at pains to collect all my hair upon my forehead trampling underfoot the curl papers which i had torn from my head and my new hat with them my mother was not at all moved by my tears but she could not suppress a cry at the sight of my battered headgear and my ruined jacket i did not however hear her oh my poor little hawthorns i was assuring them through my sobs it is not you that want to make me unhappy to force me to leave you you you have never done me any harm so i shall always love you and drying my eyes i promised them that when i grew up i would never copy the foolish example of other men but that even in paris on fine spring days instead of paying calls and listening to silly talk i would make excursions into the country to see the first hawthorn trees in bloom once in the fields we never left them again during the rest of our méséglise walk they were perpetually crossed as though by invisible streams of traffic by the wind which was to me the tutelary genius of combray every year on the day of our arrival in order to feel that i really was at combray i would climb the hill to find it running again through my clothing and setting me running in its wake one always had the wind for companion when one went the 'méséglise way ' on that swelling plain which stretched mile beyond mile without any disturbance of its gentle contour i knew that mlle swann used often to go and spend a few days at laon and for all that it was many miles away the distance was obviated by the absence of any intervening obstacle when on hot afternoons i would see a breath of wind emerge from the farthest horizon bowing the heads of the corn in distant fields pouring like a flood over all that vast expanse and finally settling down warm and rustling among the clover and sainfoin at my feet that plain which was common to us both seemed then to draw us together to unite us i would imagine that the same breath had passed by her also that there was some message from her in what it was whispering to me without my being able to understand it and i would catch and kiss it as it passed on my left was a village called champieu campus pagani according to the curé on my right i could see across the cornfields the two crocketed rustic spires of saint andré des champs themselves as tapering scaly plated honeycombed yellowed and roughened as two ears of wheat at regular intervals among the inimitable ornamentation of their leaves which can be mistaken for those of no other fruit tree the apple trees were exposing their broad petals of white satin or hanging in shy bunches their unopened blushing buds it was while going the 'méséglise way' that i first noticed the circular shadow which apple trees cast upon the sunlit ground and also those impalpable threads of golden silk which the setting sun weaves slantingly downwards from beneath their leaves and which i would see my father slash through with his stick without ever making them swerve from their straight path sometimes in the afternoon sky a white moon would creep up like a little cloud furtive without display suggesting an actress who does not have to 'come on' for a while and so goes 'in front' in her ordinary clothes to watch the rest of the company for a moment but keeps in the background not wishing to attract attention to herself i was glad to find her image reproduced in books and paintings though these works of art were very different at least in my earlier years before bloch had attuned my eyes and mind to more subtle harmonies from those in which the moon seems fair to me to day but in which i should not have recognised her then it might be for instance some novel by saintine some landscape by gleyre in which she is cut out sharply against the sky in the form of a silver sickle some work as unsophisticated and as incomplete as were at that date my own impressions and which it enraged my grandmother's sisters to see me admire they held that one ought to set before children and that children shewed their own innate good taste in admiring only such books and pictures as they would continue to admire when their minds were developed and mature no doubt they regarded aesthetic values as material objects which an unclouded vision could not fail to discern without needing to have their equivalent in experience of life stored up and slowly ripening in one's heart it was along the 'méséglise way ' at montjouvain a house built on the edge of a large pond and overlooked by a steep shrub grown hill that m vinteuil lived and so we used often to meet his daughter driving her dogcart at full speed along the road after a certain year we never saw her alone but always accompanied by a friend a girl older than herself with an evil reputation in the neighbourhood who in the end installed herself permanently one day at montjouvain people said that poor m vinteuil must be blinded by love not to see what everyone is talking about and to let his daughter a man who is horrified if you use a word in the wrong sense bring a woman like that to live under his roof he says that she is a most superior woman with a heart of gold and that she would have shewn extraordinary musical talent if she had only been trained he may be sure it is not music that she is teaching his daughter but m vinteuil assured them that it was and indeed it is remarkable that people never fail to arouse admiration of their normal qualities in the relatives of anyone with whom they are in physical intercourse bodily passion which has been so unjustly decried compels its victims to display every vestige that is in them of unselfishness and generosity and so effectively that they shine resplendent in the eyes of all beholders dr percepied whose loud voice and bushy eyebrows enabled him to play to his heart's content the part of 'double dealer ' a part to which he was not otherwise adapted without in the least degree compromising his unassailable and quite unmerited reputation of being a kind hearted old curmudgeon could make the curé and everyone else laugh until they cried by saying in a harsh voice what d'ye say to this now it seems that she plays music with her friend mlle vinteuil that surprises you does it oh i know nothing nothing at all it was papa vinteuil who told me all about it yesterday after all she has every right to be fond of music that girl i should never dream of thwarting the artistic vocation of a child nor vinteuil either it seems and then he plays music too with his daughter's friend why gracious heavens it must be a regular musical box that house out there what are you laughing at i say they've been playing too much music those people i met papa vinteuil the other day by the cemetery it was all he could do to keep on his feet anyone who like ourselves had seen m vinteuil about this time avoiding people whom he knew and turning away as soon as he caught sight of them changed in a few months into an old man engulfed in a sea of sorrows incapable of any effort not directly aimed at promoting his daughter's happiness spending whole days beside his wife's grave could hardly have failed to realise that he was gradually dying of a broken heart could hardly have supposed that he paid no attention to the rumours which were going about he knew perhaps he even believed what his neighbours were saying there is probably no one however rigid his virtue who is not liable to find himself by the complexity of circumstances living at close quarters with the very vice which he himself has been most outspoken in condemning without at first recognising it beneath the disguise which it assumes on entering his presence so as to wound him and to make him suffer the odd words the unaccountable attitude one evening of a person whom he has a thousand reasons for loving but for a man of m vinteuil's sensibility it must have been far more painful than for a hardened man of the world to have to resign himself to one of those situations which are wrongly supposed to occur in bohemian circles only for they are produced whenever there needs to establish itself in the security necessary to its development a vice which nature herself has planted in the soul of a child perhaps by no more than blending the virtues of its father and mother as she might blend the colours of their eyes and yet however much m vinteuil may have known of his daughter's conduct it did not follow that his adoration of her grew any less the facts of life do not penetrate to the sphere in which our beliefs are cherished as it was not they that engendered those beliefs so they are powerless to destroy them they can aim at them continual blows of contradiction and disproof without weakening them and an avalanche of miseries and maladies coming one after another without interruption into the bosom of a family will not make it lose faith in either the clemency of its god or the capacity of its physician but when m vinteuil regarded his daughter and himself from the point of view of the world and of their reputation when he attempted to place himself by her side in the rank which they occupied in the general estimation of their neighbours then he was bound to give judgment to utter his own and her social condemnation in precisely the terms which the inhabitant of combray most hostile to him and his daughter would have employed he saw himself and her in 'low ' in the very 'lowest water ' inextricably stranded and his manners had of late been tinged with that humility that respect for persons who ranked above him and to whom he must now look up however far beneath him they might hitherto have been that tendency to search for some means of rising again to their level which is an almost mechanical result of any human misfortune one day when we were walking with swann in one of the streets of combray m vinteuil turning out of another street found himself so suddenly face to face with us all that he had not time to escape and swann with that almost arrogant charity of a man of the world who amid the dissolution of all his own moral prejudices finds in another's shame merely a reason for treating him with a friendly benevolence the outward signs of which serve to enhance and gratify the self esteem of the bestower because he feels that they are all the more precious to him upon whom they are bestowed conversed at great length with m vinteuil with whom for a long time he had been barely on speaking terms and invited him before leaving us to send his daughter over one day to play at tansonville it was an invitation which two years earlier would have enraged m vinteuil but which now filled him with so much gratitude that he felt himself obliged to refrain from the indiscretion of accepting swann's friendly regard for his daughter seemed to him to be in itself so honourable so precious a support for his cause that he felt it would perhaps be better to make no use of it so as to have the wholly platonic satisfaction of keeping it in reserve what a charming man he said to us after swann had gone with the same enthusiasm and veneration which make clever and pretty women of the middle classes fall victims to the physical and intellectual charms of a duchess even though she be ugly and a fool what a charming man what a pity that he should have made such a deplorable marriage and then so strong an element of hypocrisy is there in even the most sincere of men who cast off while they are talking to anyone the opinion they actually hold of him and will express when he is no longer there my family joined with m vinteuil in deploring swann's marriage invoking principles and conventions which all the more because they invoked them in common with him as though we were all thorough good fellows of the same sort they appeared to suggest were in no way infringed at montjouvain m vinteuil did not send his daughter to visit swann an omission which swann was the first to regret for constantly after meeting m vinteuil he would remember that he had been meaning for a long time to ask him about some one of the same name as himself one of his relatives swann supposed and on this occasion he determined that he would not forget what he had to say to him when m vinteuil should appear with his daughter at tansonville since the 'méséglise way' was the shorter of the two that we used to take for our walks round combray and for that reason was reserved for days of uncertain weather it followed that the climate of méséglise shewed an unduly high rainfall and we would never lose sight of the fringe of roussainville wood so that we could at any moment run for shelter beneath its dense thatch of leaves often the sun would disappear behind a cloud which impinged on its roundness but whose edge the sun gilded in return the brightness though not the light of day would then be shut off from a landscape in which all life appeared to be suspended while the little village of roussainville carved in relief upon the sky the white mass of its gables with a startling precision of detail a gust of wind blew from its perch a rook which floated away and settled in the distance while beneath a paling sky the woods on the horizon assumed a deeper tone of blue as though they were painted in one of those cameos which you still find decorating the walls of old houses but on other days would begin to fall the rain of which we had had due warning from the little barometer figure which the spectacle maker hung out in his doorway its drops like migrating birds which fly off in a body at a given moment would come down out of the sky in close marching order they would never drift apart would make no movement at random in their rapid course but each one keeping in its place would draw after it the drop which was following and the sky would be as greatly darkened as by the swallows flying south we would take refuge among the trees and when it seemed that their flight was accomplished a few last drops feebler and slower than the rest would still come down but we would emerge from our shelter for the rain was playing a game now among the branches and even when it was almost dry again underfoot a stray drop or two lingering in the hollow of a leaf would run down and hang glistening from the point of it until suddenly it splashed plump upon our upturned faces from the whole height of the tree often too we would hurry for shelter tumbling in among all its stony saints and patriarchs into the porch of saint andré des champs how typically french that church was over its door the saints the kings of chivalry with lilies in their hands the wedding scenes and funerals were carved as they might have been in the mind of françoise the sculptor had also recorded certain anecdotes of aristotle and virgil precisely as françoise in her kitchen would break into speech about saint louis as though she herself had known him generally in order to depreciate by contrast with him my grandparents whom she considered less 'righteous ' one could see that the ideas which the mediaeval artist and the mediaeval peasant who had survived to cook for us in the nineteenth century had of classical and of early christian history ideas whose inaccuracy was atoned for by their honest simplicity were derived not from books but from a tradition at once ancient and direct unbroken oral degraded unrecognisable and alive another combray person whom i could discern also potential and typified in the gothic sculptures of saint andré des champs was young théodore the assistant in camus's shop and indeed françoise herself was well aware that she had in him a countryman and contemporary for when my aunt was too ill for françoise to be able unaided to lift her in her bed or to carry her to her chair rather than let the kitchen maid come upstairs and perhaps 'make an impression' on my aunt she would send out for théodore and this lad who was regarded and quite rightly in the town as a 'bad character ' was so abounding in that spirit which had served to decorate the porch of saint andré des champs and particularly in the feelings of respect due in françoise eyes to all 'poor invalids ' and above all to her own 'poor mistress ' that he had when he bent down to raise my aunt's head from her pillow the same air of préraphaélite simplicity and zeal which the little angels in the bas reliefs wear who throng with tapers in their hands about the deathbed of our lady as though those carved faces of stone naked and grey like trees in winter were like them asleep only storing up life and waiting to flower again in countless plebeian faces reverend and cunning as the face of théodore and glowing with the ruddy brilliance of ripe apples there too not fastened to the wall like the little angels but detached from the porch of more than human stature erect upon her pedestal as upon a footstool which had been placed there to save her feet from contact with the wet ground stood a saint with the full cheeks the firm breasts which swelled out inside her draperies like a cluster of ripe grapes inside a bag the narrow forehead short and stubborn nose deep set eyes and strong thick skinned courageous expression of the country women of those parts this similarity which imparted to the statue itself a kindliness that i had not looked to find in it was corroborated often by the arrival of some girl from the fields come like ourselves for shelter beneath the porch whose presence there as when the leaves of a climbing plant have grown up beside leaves carved in stone seemed intended by fate to allow us by confronting it with its type in nature to form a critical estimate of the truth of the work of art before our eyes in the distance a promised or an accursed land roussainville within whose walls i had never penetrated roussainville was now when the rain had ceased for us still being chastised like a village in the old testament by all the innumerable spears and arrows of the storm which beat down obliquely upon the dwellings of its inhabitants or else had already received the forgiveness of the almighty who had restored to it the light of his sun which fell upon it in rays of uneven length like the rays of a monstrance upon an altar sometimes when the weather had completely broken we were obliged to go home and to remain shut up indoors here and there in the distance in a landscape which what with the failing light and saturated atmosphere resembled a seascape rather a few solitary houses clinging to the lower slopes of a hill whose heights were buried in a cloudy darkness shone out like little boats which had folded their sails and would ride at anchor all night upon the sea but what mattered rain or storm in summer bad weather is no more than a passing fit of superficial ill temper expressed by the permanent underlying fine weather a very different thing from the fluid and unstable 'fine weather' of winter its very opposite in fact for has it not firmly established in the soil on which it has taken solid form in dense masses of foliage over which the rain may pour in torrents without weakening the resistance offered by their real and lasting happiness hoisted to keep them flying throughout the season in the village streets on the walls of the houses and in their gardens its silken banners violet and white sitting in the little parlour where i would pass the time until dinner with a book i might hear the water dripping from our chestnut trees but i would know that the shower would only glaze and brighten the greenness of their thick crumpled leaves and that they themselves had undertaken to remain there like pledges of summer all through the rainy night to assure me of the fine weather's continuing it might rain as it pleased but to morrow over the white fence of tansonville there would surge and flow numerous as ever a sea of little heart shaped leaves and without the least anxiety i could watch the poplar in the rue des perchamps praying for mercy bowing in desperation before the storm without the least anxiety i could hear at the far end of the garden the last peals of thunder growling among our lilac trees if the weather was bad all morning my family would abandon the idea of a walk and i would remain at home but later on i formed the habit of going out by myself on such days and walking towards méséglise la vineuse during that autumn when we had to come to combray to settle the division of my aunt léonie's estate for she had died at last leaving both parties among her neighbours triumphant in the fact of her demise those who had insisted that her mode of life was enfeebling and must ultimately kill her and equally those who had always maintained that she suffered from some disease not imaginary but organic by the visible proof of which the most sceptical would be obliged to own themselves convinced once she had succumbed to it causing no intense grief to any save one of her survivors but to that one a grief savage in its violence during the long fortnight of my aunt's last illness françoise never went out of her room for an instant never took off her clothes allowed no one else to do anything for my aunt and did not leave her body until it was actually in its grave then at last we understood that the sort of terror in which françoise had lived of my aunt's harsh words her suspicions and her anger had developed in her a sentiment which we had mistaken for hatred and which was really veneration and love her true mistress whose decisions it had been impossible to foresee from whose stratagems it had been so hard to escape of whose good nature it had been so easy to take advantage her sovereign her mysterious and omnipotent monarch was no more compared with such a mistress we counted for very little the time had long passed when on our first coming to spend our holidays at combray we had been of equal importance in françoise eyes with my aunt during that autumn my parents finding the days so fully occupied with the legal formalities that had to be gone through and discussions with solicitors and farmers that they had little time for walks which as it happened the weather made precarious began to let me go without them along the 'méséglise way ' wrapped up in a huge highland plaid which protected me from the rain and which i was all the more ready to throw over my shoulders because i felt that the stripes of its gaudy tartan scandalised françoise whom it was impossible to convince that the colour of one's clothes had nothing whatever to do with one's mourning for the dead and to whom the grief which we had shewn on my aunt's death was wholly unsatisfactory since we had not entertained the neighbours to a great funeral banquet and did not adopt a special tone when we spoke of her while i at times might be heard humming a tune i am sure that in a book and to that extent my feelings were closely akin to those of françoise such a conception of mourning in the manner of the chanson de roland and of the porch of saint andré des champs would have seemed most attractive but the moment that françoise herself approached some evil spirit would urge me to attempt to make her angry and i would avail myself of the slightest pretext to say to her that i regretted my aunt's death because she had been a good woman in spite of her absurdities but not in the least because she was my aunt that she might easily have been my aunt and yet have been so odious that her death would not have caused me a moment's sorrow statements which in a book would have struck me as merely fatuous and if françoise then inspired like a poet with a flood of confused reflections upon bereavement grief and family memories were to plead her inability to rebut my theories saying i don't know how to espress myself i would triumph over her with an ironical and brutal common sense worthy of dr percepied and if she went on all the same she was a geological relation there is always the respect due to your geology i would shrug my shoulders and say it is really very good of me to discuss the matter with an illiterate old woman who cannot speak her own language adopting to deliver judgment on françoise the mean and narrow outlook of the pedant whom those who are most contemptuous of him in the impartiality of their own minds are only too prone to copy when they are obliged to play a part upon the vulgar stage of life my walks that autumn were all the more delightful because i used to take them after long hours spent over a book when i was tired of reading after a whole morning in the house i would throw my plaid across my shoulders and set out my body which in a long spell of enforced immobility had stored up an accumulation of vital energy was now obliged like a spinning top wound and let go to spend this in every direction the walls of houses the tansonville hedge the trees of roussainville wood the bushes against which montjouvain leaned its back all must bear the blows of my walking stick or umbrella must hear my shouts of happiness blows and shouts being indeed no more than expressions of the confused ideas which exhilarated me and which not being developed to the point at which they might rest exposed to the light of day rather than submit to a slow and difficult course of elucidation found it easier and more pleasant to drift into an immediate outlet and so it is that the bulk of what appear to be the emotional renderings of our inmost sensations do no more than relieve us of the burden of those sensations by allowing them to escape from us in an indistinct form which does not teach us how it should be interpreted when i attempt to reckon up all that i owe to the 'méséglise way ' all the humble discoveries of which it was either the accidental setting or the direct inspiration and cause i am reminded that it was in that same autumn on one of those walks near the bushy precipice which guarded montjouvain from the rear that i was struck for the first time by this lack of harmony between our impressions and their normal forms of expression after an hour of rain and wind against which i had put up a brisk fight as i came to the edge of the montjouvain pond and reached a little hut roofed with tiles in which m vinteuil's gardener kept his tools the sun shone out again and its golden rays washed clean by the shower blazed once more in the sky on the trees on the wall of the hut and on the still wet tiles of the roof which had a chicken perching upon its ridge the wind pulled out sideways the wild grass that grew in the wall and the chicken's downy feathers both of which things let themselves float upon the wind's breath to their full extent with the unresisting submissiveness of light and lifeless matter the tiled roof cast upon the pond whose reflections were now clear again in the sunlight a square of pink marble the like of which i had never observed before and seeing upon the water where it reflected the wall a pallid smile responding to the smiling sky i cried aloud in my enthusiasm brandishing my furled umbrella damn damn damn damn but at the same time i felt that i was in duty bound not to content myself with these unilluminating words but to endeavour to see more clearly into the sources of my enjoyment and it was at that moment too thanks to a peasant who went past apparently in a bad enough humour already but more so when he nearly received my umbrella in his face and who replied without any cordiality to my fine day what good to be out walking that i learned that identical emotions do not spring up in the hearts of all men simultaneously by a pre established order later on i discovered that whenever i had read for too long and was in a mood for conversation the friend to whom i would be burning to say something would at that moment have finished indulging himself in the delights of conversation and wanted nothing now but to be left to read undisturbed and if i had been thinking with affection of my parents and forming the most sensible and proper plans for giving them pleasure they would have been using the same interval of time to discover some misdeed that i had already forgotten and would begin to scold me severely just as i flung myself upon them with a kiss sometimes to the exhilaration which i derived from being alone would be added an alternative feeling so that i could not be clear in my mind to which i should give the casting vote a feeling stimulated by the desire to see rise up before my eyes a peasant girl whom i might clasp in my arms coming abruptly and without giving me time to trace it accurately to its source among so many ideas of a very different kind the pleasure which accompanied this desire seemed only a degree superior to what was given me by my other thoughts i found an additional merit in everything that was in my mind at the moment in the pink reflection of the tiled roof the wild grass in the wall the village of roussainville into which i had long desired to penetrate the trees of its wood and the steeple of its church created in them by this fresh emotion which made them appear more desirable only because i thought it was they that had provoked it and which seemed only to wish to bear me more swiftly towards them when it filled my sails with a potent unknown and propitious breeze but if this desire that a woman should appear added for me something more exalting than the charms of nature they in their turn enlarged what i might in the woman's charm have found too much restricted it seemed to me that the beauty of the trees was hers also and that as for the spirit of those horizons of the village of roussainville of the books which i was reading that year it was her kiss which would make me master of them all and my imagination drawing strength from contact with my sensuality my sensuality expanding through all the realms of my imagination my desire had no longer any bounds moreover just as in moments of musing contemplation of nature the normal actions of the mind being suspended and our abstract ideas of things set on one side we believe with the profoundest faith in the originality in the individual existence of the place in which we may happen to be the passing figure which my desire evoked seemed to be not any one example of the general type of 'woman ' but a necessary and natural product of the soil for at that time everything which was not myself the earth and the creatures upon it seemed to me more precious more important endowed with a more real existence than they appear to full grown men and between the earth and its creatures i made no distinction i had a desire for a peasant girl from méséglise or roussainville for a fisher girl from balbec just as i had a desire for balbec and méséglise the pleasure which those girls were empowered to give me would have seemed less genuine i should have had no faith in it any longer if i had been at liberty to modify its conditions as i chose to meet in paris a fisher girl from balbec or a peasant girl from méséglise would have been like receiving the present of a shell which i had never seen upon the beach or of a fern which i had never found among the woods would have stripped from the pleasure which she was about to give me all those other pleasures in the thick of which my imagination had enwrapped her but to wander thus among the woods of roussainville without a peasant girl to embrace was to see those woods and yet know nothing of their secret treasure their deep hidden beauty that girl whom i never saw save dappled with the shadows of their leaves was to me herself a plant of local growth only taller than the rest and one whose structure would enable me to approach more closely than in them to the intimate savour of the land from which she had sprung i could believe this all the more readily and also that the caresses by which she would bring that savour to my senses were themselves of a particular kind yielding a pleasure which i could never derive from any but herself since i was still and must for long remain in that period of life when one has not yet separated the fact of this sensual pleasure from the various women in whose company one has tasted it when one has not reduced it to a general idea which makes one regard them thenceforward as the variable instruments of a pleasure that is always the same indeed that pleasure does not exist isolated and formulated in the consciousness as the ultimate object with which one seeks a woman's company or as the cause of the uneasiness which in anticipation one then feels hardly even does one think of oneself but only how to escape from oneself obscurely awaited immanent and concealed it rouses to such a paroxysm at the moment when at last it makes itself felt those other pleasures which we find in the tender glance in the kiss of her who is by our side that it seems to us more than anything else a sort of transport of gratitude for the kindness of heart of our companion and for her touching predilection of ourselves which we measure by the benefits by the happiness that she showers upon us alas it was in vain that i implored the dungeon keep of roussainville that i begged it to send out to meet me some daughter of its village appealing to it as to the sole confidant to whom i had disclosed my earliest desire when from the top floor of our house at combray from the little room that smelt of orris root i had peered out and seen nothing but its tower framed in the square of the half opened window while with the heroic scruples of a traveller setting forth for unknown climes or of a desperate wretch hesitating on the verge of self destruction faint with emotion i explored across the bounds of my own experience an untrodden path which i believed might lead me to my death even until passion spent itself and left me shuddering among the sprays of flowering currant which creeping in through the window tumbled all about my body in vain i called upon it now in vain i compressed the whole landscape into my field of vision draining it with an exhaustive gaze which sought to extract from it a female creature i might go alone as far as the porch of saint andré des champs never did i find there the girl whom i should inevitably have met had i been with my grandfather and so unable to engage her in conversation i would fix my eyes without limit of time upon the trunk of a distant tree from behind which she must appear and spring towards me my closest scrutiny left the horizon barren as before night was falling without any hope now would i concentrate my attention as though to force up out of it the creatures which it must conceal upon that sterile soil that stale and outworn land and it was no longer in lightness of heart but with sullen anger that i aimed blows at the trees of roussainville wood from among which no more living creatures made their appearance than if they had been trees painted on the stretched canvas background of a panorama when unable to resign myself to having to return home without having held in my arms the woman i so greatly desired i was yet obliged to retrace my steps towards combray and to admit to myself that the chance of her appearing in my path grew smaller every moment and if she had appeared would i have dared to speak to her i felt that she would have regarded me as mad for i no longer thought of those desires which came to me on my walks but were never realized as being shared by others or as having any existence apart from myself they seemed nothing more now than the purely subjective impotent illusory creatures of my temperament they were in no way connected now with nature with the world of real things which from now onwards lost all its charm and significance and meant no more to my life than a purely conventional framework just as the action of a novel is framed in the railway carriage on a seat of which a traveller is reading it to pass the time and it is perhaps from another impression which i received at mont jouvain some years later an impression which at that time was without meaning that there arose long afterwards my idea of that cruel side of human passion called 'sadism ' we shall see in due course that for quite another reason the memory of this impression was to play an important part in my life it was during a spell of very hot weather my parents who had been obliged to go away for the whole day had told me that i might stay out as late as i pleased and having gone as far as the montjouvain pond where i enjoyed seeing again the reflection of the tiled roof of the hut i had lain down in the shade and gone to sleep among the bushes on the steep slope that rose up behind the house just where i had waited for my parents years before one day when they had gone to call on m vinteuil it was almost dark when i awoke and i wished to rise and go away but i saw mlle vinteuil or thought at least that i recognised her for i had not seen her often at combray and then only when she was still a child whereas she was now growing into a young woman who probably had just come in standing in front of me and only a few feet away from me in that room in which her father had entertained mine and which she had now made into a little sitting room for herself the window was partly open the lamp was lighted i could watch her every movement without her being able to see me but had i gone away i must have made a rustling sound among the bushes she would have heard me and might have thought that i had been hiding there in order to spy upon her she was in deep mourning for her father had but lately died we had not gone to see her my mother had not cared to go on account of that virtue which alone in her fixed any bounds to her benevolence namely modesty but she pitied the girl from the depths of her heart my mother had not forgotten the sad end of m vinteuil's life his complete absorption first in having to play both mother and nursery maid to his daughter and later in the suffering which she had caused him she could see the tortured expression which was never absent from the old man's face in those terrible last years she knew that he had definitely abandoned the task of transcribing in fair copies the whole of his later work the poor little pieces we imagined of an old music master a retired village organist which we assumed were of little or no value in themselves though we did not despise them because they were of such great value to him and had been the chief motive of his life before he sacrificed them to his daughter pieces which being mostly not even written down but recorded only in his memory while the rest were scribbled on loose sheets of paper and quite illegible must now remain unknown for ever my mother thought also of that other and still more cruel renunciation to which m vinteuil had been driven that of seeing the girl happily settled with an honest and respectable future when she called to mind all this utter and crushing misery that had come upon my aunts' old music master she was moved to very real grief and shuddered to think of that other grief so different in its bitterness which mlle vinteuil must now be feeling tinged with remorse at having virtually killed her father poor m vinteuil my mother would say he lived for his daughter and now he has died for her without getting his reward will he get it now i wonder and in what form it can only come to him from her at the far end of mlle vinteuil's sitting room on the mantelpiece stood a small photograph of her father which she went briskly to fetch just as the sound of carriage wheels was heard from the road outside then flung herself down on a sofa and drew close beside her a little table on which she placed the photograph just as long ago m vinteuil had 'placed' beside him the piece of music which he would have liked to play over to my parents and then her friend came in mlle vinteuil greeted her without rising clasping her hands behind her head and drew her body to one side of the sofa as though to 'make room ' but no sooner had she done this than she appeared to feel that she was perhaps suggesting a particular position to her friend with an emphasis which might well be regarded as importunate she thought that her friend would prefer no doubt to sit down at some distance from her upon a chair she felt that she had been indiscreet her sensitive heart took fright stretching herself out again over the whole of the sofa she closed her eyes and began to yawn so as to indicate that it was a desire to sleep and that alone which had made her lie down there despite the rude and hectoring familiarity with which she treated her companion i could recognise in her the obsequious and reticent advances the abrupt scruples and restraints which had characterised her father presently she rose and came to the window where she pretended to be trying to close the shutters and not succeeding leave them open said her friend i am hot but it's too dreadful people will see us mlle vinteuil answered and then she guessed probably that her friend would think that she had uttered these words simply in order to provoke a reply in certain other words which she seemed indeed to wish to hear spoken but from prudence would let her friend be the first to speak and so although i could not see her face clearly enough i am sure that the expression must have appeared on it which my grandmother had once found so delightful when she hastily went on when i say 'see us' i mean of course see us reading it's so dreadful to think that in every trivial little thing you do some one may be overlooking you with the instinctive generosity of her nature a courtesy beyond her control she refrained from uttering the studied words which she had felt were indispensable for the full realisation of her desire and perpetually in the depths of her being a shy and suppliant maiden would kneel before that other element the old campaigner battered but triumphant would intercede with him and oblige him to retire oh yes it is so extremely likely that people are looking at us at this time of night in this densely populated district said her friend with bitter irony and what if they are she went on feeling bound to annotate with a malicious yet affectionate wink these words which she was repeating out of good nature like a lesson prepared beforehand which she knew it would please mlle vinteuil to hear and what if they are all the better that they should see us mlle vinteuil shuddered and rose to her feet in her sensitive and scrupulous heart she was ignorant what words ought to flow spontaneously from her lips so as to produce the scene for which her eager senses clamoured she reached out as far as she could across the limitations of her true character to find the language appropriate to a vicious young woman such as she longed to be thought but the words which she imagined such a young woman might have uttered with sincerity sounded unreal in her own mouth and what little she allowed herself to say was said in a strained tone in which her ingrained timidity paralysed her tendency to freedom and audacity of speech while she kept on interrupting herself with you're sure you aren't cold you aren't too hot you don't want to sit and read by yourself your ladyship's thoughts seem to be rather 'warm' this evening she concluded doubtless repeating a phrase which she had heard used on some earlier occasion by her friend in the v shaped opening of her crape bodice mlle vinteuil felt the sting of her friend's sudden kiss she gave a little scream and ran away and then they began to chase one another about the room scrambling over the furniture their wide sleeves fluttering like wings clucking and crowing like a pair of amorous fowls at last mlle vinteuil fell down exhausted upon the sofa where she was screened from me by the stooping body of her friend but the latter now had her back turned to the little table on which the old music master's portrait had been arranged mlle vinteuil realised that her friend would not see it unless her attention were drawn to it and so exclaimed as if she herself had just noticed it for the first time oh there's my father's picture looking at us i can't think who can have put it there i'm sure i've told them twenty times that is not the proper place for it i remembered the words that m vinteuil had used to my parents in apologising for an obtrusive sheet of music this photograph was of course in common use in their ritual observances was subjected to daily profanation for the friend replied in words which were evidently a liturgical response let him stay there he can't trouble us any longer d'you think he'd start whining d'you think he'd pack you out of the house if he could see you now with the window open the ugly old monkey to which mlle vinteuil replied oh please a gentle reproach which testified to the genuine goodness of her nature not that it was prompted by any resentment at hearing her father spoken of in this fashion for that was evidently a feeling which she had trained herself by a long course of sophistries to keep in close subjection at such moments but rather because it was the bridle which so as to avoid all appearance of egotism she herself used to curb the gratification which her friend was attempting to procure for her it may well have been too that the smiling moderation with which she faced and answered these blasphemies that this tender and hypocritical rebuke appeared to her frank and generous nature as a particularly shameful and seductive form of that criminal attitude towards life which she was endeavouring to adopt but she could not resist the attraction of being treated with affection by a woman who had just shewn herself so implacable towards the defenceless dead she sprang on to the knees of her friend and held out a chaste brow to be kissed precisely as a daughter would have done to her mother feeling with exquisite joy that they would thus between them inflict the last turn of the screw of cruelty in robbing m vinteuil as though they were actually rifling his tomb of the sacred rights of fatherhood her friend took the girl's head in her hands and placed a kiss on her brow with a docility prompted by the real affection she had for mlle vinteuil as well as by the desire to bring what distraction she could into the dull and melancholy life of an orphan do you know what i should like to do to that old horror she said taking up the photograph she murmured in mlle vinteuil's ear something that i could not distinguish oh you would never dare not dare to spit on it on that shouted the friend with deliberate brutality i heard no more for mlle vinteuil who now seemed weary awkward preoccupied sincere and rather sad came back to the window and drew the shutters close but i knew now what was the reward that m vinteuil in return for all the suffering that he had endured in his lifetime on account of his daughter had received from her after his death and yet i have since reflected that if m vinteuil had been able to be present at this scene he might still and in spite of everything have continued to believe in his daughter's soundness of heart and that he might even in so doing have been not altogether wrong it was true that in all mlle vinteuil's actions the appearance of evil was so strong and so consistent that it would have been hard to find it exhibited in such completeness save in what is nowadays called a 'sadist' it is behind the footlights of a paris theatre and not under the homely lamp of an actual country house that one expects to see a girl leading her friend on to spit upon the portrait of a father who has lived and died for nothing and no one but herself and when we find in real life a desire for melodramatic effect it is generally the 'sadic' instinct that is responsible for it it is possible that without being in the least inclined towards 'sadism ' a girl might have shewn the same outrageous cruelty as mlle vinteuil in desecrating the memory and defying the wishes of her dead father but she would not have given them deliberate expression in an act so crude in its symbolism so lacking in subtlety the criminal element in her behaviour would have been less evident to other people and even to herself since she would not have admitted to herself that she was doing wrong but appearances apart in mlle vinteuil's soul at least in the earlier stages the evil element was probably not unmixed a 'sadist' of her kind is an artist in evil which a wholly wicked person could not be for in that case the evil would not have been external it would have seemed quite natural to her and would not even have been distinguishable from herself and as for virtue respect for the dead filial obedience since she would never have practised the cult of these things she would take no impious delight in their profanation 'sadists' of mlle vinteuil's sort are creatures so purely sentimental so virtuous by nature that even sensual pleasure appears to them as something bad a privilege reserved for the wicked and when they allow themselves for a moment to enjoy it they endeavour to impersonate to assume all the outward appearance of wicked people for themselves and their partners in guilt so as to gain the momentary illusion of having escaped beyond the control of their own gentle and scrupulous natures into the inhuman world of pleasure and i could understand how she must have longed for such an escape when i realised that it was impossible for her to effect it at the moment when she wished to be thought the very antithesis of her father what she at once suggested to me were the mannerisms in thought and speech of the poor old music master indeed his photograph was nothing what she really desecrated what she corrupted into ministering to her pleasures but what remained between them and her and prevented her from any direct enjoyment of them was the likeness between her face and his his mother's blue eyes which he had handed down to her like some trinket to be kept in the family those little friendly movements and inclinations which set up between the viciousness of mlle vinteuil and herself a phraseology a mentality not designed for vice which made her regard it as not in any way different from the numberless little social duties and courtesies to which she must devote herself every day it was not evil that gave her the idea of pleasure that seemed to her attractive it was pleasure rather that seemed evil and as every time that she indulged in it pleasure came to her attended by evil thoughts such as ordinarily had no place in her virtuous mind she came at length to see in pleasure itself something diabolical to identify it with evil perhaps mlle vinteuil felt that at heart her friend was not altogether bad not really sincere when she gave vent to those blasphemous utterances at any rate she had the pleasure of receiving those kisses on her brow those smiles those glances all feigned perhaps but akin in their base and vicious mode of expression to those which would have been discernible on the face of a creature formed not out of kindness and long suffering but out of self indulgence and cruelty she was able to delude herself for a moment into believing that she was indeed amusing herself in the way in which with so unnatural an accomplice a girl might amuse herself who really did experience that savage antipathy towards her father's memory perhaps she would not have thought of wickedness as a state so rare so abnormal so exotic one which it was so refreshing to visit had she been able to distinguish in herself as in all her fellow men and women that indifference to the sufferings which they cause which whatever names else be given it is the one true terrible and lasting form of cruelty if the 'méséglise way' was so easy it was a very different matter when we took the 'guermantes way ' for that meant a long walk and we must make sure first of the weather when we seemed to have entered upon a spell of fine days when françoise in desperation that not a drop was falling upon the 'poor crops ' gazing up at the sky and seeing there only a little white cloud floating here and there upon its calm azure surface groaned aloud and exclaimed you would say they were nothing more nor less than a lot of dogfish swimming about and sticking up their snouts ah they never think of making it rain a little for the poor labourers and then when the corn is all ripe down it will come rattling all over the place and think no more of where it is falling than if it was on the sea when my father's appeals to the gardener had met with the same encouraging answer several times in succession then some one would say at dinner to morrow if the weather holds we might go the guermantes way and off we would set immediately after luncheon through the little garden gate which dropped us into the rue des perchamps narrow and bent at a sharp angle dotted with grass plots over which two or three wasps would spend the day botanising a street as quaint as its name from which its odd characteristics and its personality were i felt derived a street for which one might search in vain through the combray of to day for the public school now rises upon its site but in my dreams of combray like those architects pupils of viollet le duc who fancying that they can detect beneath a renaissance rood loft and an eighteenth century altar traces of a norman choir restore the whole church to the state in which it probably was in the twelfth century i leave not a stone of the modern edifice standing i pierce through it and 'restore' the rue des perchamps and for such reconstruction memory furnishes me with more detailed guidance than is generally at the disposal of restorers the pictures which it has preserved perhaps the last surviving in the world to day and soon to follow the rest into oblivion of what combray looked like in my childhood's days pictures which simply because it was the old combray that traced their outlines upon my mind before it vanished are as moving if i may compare a humble landscape with those glorious works reproductions of which my grandmother was so fond of bestowing on me as those old engravings of the 'cenacolo ' or that painting by gentile bellini in which one sees in a state in which they no longer exist the masterpiece of leonardo and the portico of saint mark's we would pass in the rue de l'oiseau before the old hostelry of the oiseau flesché into whose great courtyard once upon a time would rumble the coaches of the duchesses de montpensier de guermantes and de montmorency when they had to come down to combray for some litigation with their farmers or to receive homage from them we would come at length to the mall among whose treetops i could distinguish the steeple of saint hilaire and i should have liked to be able to sit down and spend the whole day there reading and listening to the bells for it was so charming there and so quiet that when an hour struck you would have said not that it broke in upon the calm of the day but that it relieved the day of its superfluity and that the steeple with the indolent painstaking exactitude of a person who has nothing else to do had simply in order to squeeze out and let fall the few golden drops which had slowly and naturally accumulated in the hot sunlight pressed at a given moment the distended surface of the silence the great charm of the 'guermantes' way was that we had beside us almost all the time the course of the vivonne we crossed it first ten minutes after leaving the house by a foot bridge called the pont vieux and every year when we arrived at combray on easter morning after the sermon if the weather was fine i would run there to see amid all the disorder that prevails on the morning of a great festival the gorgeous preparations for which make the everyday household utensils that they have not contrived to banish seem more sordid than ever the river flowing past sky blue already between banks still black and bare its only companions a clump of daffodils come out before their time a few primroses the first in flower while here and there burned the blue flame of a violet its stem bent beneath the weight of the drop of perfume stored in its tiny horn the pont vieux led to a tow path which at this point would be overhung in summer by the bluish foliage of a hazel under which a fisherman in a straw hat seemed to have taken root at combray where i knew everyone and could always detect the blacksmith or grocer's boy through his disguise of a beadle's uniform or chorister's surplice this fisherman was the only person whom i was never able to identify he must have known my family for he used to raise his hat when we passed and then i would always be just on the point of asking his name when some one would make a sign to me to be quiet or i would frighten the fish we would follow the tow path which ran along the top of a steep bank several feet above the stream the ground on the other side was lower and stretched in a series of broad meadows as far as the village and even to the distant railway station over these were strewn the remains half buried in the long grass of the castle of the old counts of combray who during the middle ages had had on this side the course of the vivonne as a barrier and defence against attack from the lords of guermantes and abbots of martinville nothing was left now but a few stumps of towers hummocks upon the broad surface of the fields hardly visible broken battlements over which in their day the bowmen had hurled down stones the watchmen had gazed out over novepont clairefontaine martinville le sec bailleau l'exempt fiefs all of them of guermantes a ring in which combray was locked but fallen among the grass now levelled with the ground climbed and commanded by boys from the christian brothers' school who came there in their playtime or with lesson books to be conned emblems of a past that had sunk down and well nigh vanished under the earth that lay by the water's edge now like an idler taking the air yet giving me strong food for thought making the name of combray connote to me not the little town of to day only but an historic city vastly different seizing and holding my imagination by the remote incomprehensible features which it half concealed beneath a spangled veil of buttercups for the buttercups grew past numbering on this spot which they had chosen for their games among the grass standing singly in couples in whole companies yellow as the yolk of eggs and glowing with an added lustre i felt because being powerless to consummate with my palate the pleasure which the sight of them never failed to give me i would let it accumulate as my eyes ranged over their gilded expanse until it had acquired the strength to create in my mind a fresh example of absolute unproductive beauty and so it had been from my earliest childhood when from the tow path i had stretched out my arms towards them before even i could pronounce their charming name a name fit for the prince in some french fairy tale colonists perhaps in some far distant century from asia but naturalised now for ever in the village well satisfied with their modest horizon rejoicing in the sunshine and the water's edge faithful to their little glimpse of the railway station yet keeping none the less as do some of our old paintings in their plebeian simplicity a poetic scintillation from the golden east i would amuse myself by watching the glass jars which the boys used to lower into the vivonne to catch minnows and which filled by the current of the stream in which they themselves also were enclosed at once 'containers' whose transparent sides were like solidified water and 'contents' plunged into a still larger container of liquid flowing crystal suggested an image of coolness more delicious and more provoking than the same water in the same jars would have done standing upon a table laid for dinner by shewing it as perpetually in flight between the impalpable water in which my hands could not arrest it and the insoluble glass in which my palate could not enjoy it i decided that i would come there again with a line and catch fish i begged for and obtained a morsel of bread from our luncheon basket and threw into the vivonne pellets which had the power it seemed to bring about a chemical precipitation for the water at once grew solid round about them in oval clusters of emaciated tadpoles which until then it had no doubt been holding in solution invisible but ready and alert to enter the stage of crystallisation presently the course of the vivonne became choked with water plants at first they appeared singly a lily for instance which the current across whose path it had unfortunately grown would never leave at rest for a moment so that like a ferry boat mechanically propelled it would drift over to one bank only to return to the other eternally repeating its double journey thrust towards the bank its stalk would be straightened out lengthened strained almost to breaking point until the current again caught it its green moorings swung back over their anchorage and brought the unhappy plant to what might fitly be called its starting point since it was fated not to rest there a moment before moving off once again i would still find it there on one walk after another always in the same helpless state suggesting certain victims of neurasthenia among whom my grandfather would have included my aunt léonie who present without modification year after year the spectacle of their odd and unaccountable habits which they always imagine themselves to be on the point of shaking off but which they always retain to the end caught in the treadmill of their own maladies and eccentricities their futile endeavours to escape serve only to actuate its mechanism to keep in motion the clockwork of their strange ineluctable fatal daily round such as these was the water lily and also like one of those wretches whose peculiar torments repeated indefinitely throughout eternity aroused the curiosity of dante who would have inquired of them at greater length and in fuller detail from the victims themselves had not virgil striding on ahead obliged him to hasten after him at full speed as i must hasten after my parents but farther on the current slackened where the stream ran through a property thrown open to the public by its owner who had made a hobby of aquatic gardening so that the little ponds into which the vivonne was here diverted were aflower with water lilies as the banks at this point were thickly wooded the heavy shade of the trees gave the water a background which was ordinarily dark green although sometimes when we were coming home on a calm evening after a stormy afternoon i have seen in its depths a clear crude blue that was almost violet suggesting a floor of japanese cloisonné here and there on the surface floated blushing like a strawberry the scarlet heart of a lily set in a ring of white petals beyond these the flowers were more frequent but paler less glossy more thickly seeded more tightly folded and disposed by accident in festoons so graceful that i would fancy i saw floating upon the stream as though after the dreary stripping of the decorations used in some watteau festival moss roses in loosened garlands elsewhere a corner seemed to be reserved for the commoner kinds of lily of a neat pink or white like rocket flowers washed clean like porcelain with housewifely care while a little farther again were others pressed close together in a floating garden bed as though pansies had flown out of a garden like butterflies and were hovering with blue and burnished wings over the transparent shadowiness of this watery border this skiey border also for it set beneath the flowers a soil of a colour more precious more moving than their own and both in the afternoon when it sparkled beneath the lilies in the kaleidoscope of a happiness silent restless and alert and towards evening when it was filled like a distant heaven with the roseate dreams of the setting sun incessantly changing and ever remaining in harmony about the more permanent colour of the flowers themselves with the utmost profundity evanescence and mystery with a quiet suggestion of infinity afternoon or evening it seemed to have set them flowering in the heart of the sky after leaving this park the vivonne began to flow again more swiftly how often have i watched and longed to imitate when i should be free to live as i chose a rower who had shipped his oars and lay stretched out on his back his head down in the bottom of his boat letting it drift with the current seeing nothing but the sky which slipped quietly above him shewing upon his features a foretaste of happiness and peace we would sit down among the irises at the water's edge in the holiday sky a lazy cloud streamed out to its full length now and then crushed by the burden of idleness a carp would heave up out of the water with an anxious gasp it was time for us to feed before starting homewards we would sit for a long time there eating fruit and bread and chocolate on the grass over which came to our ears horizontal faint but solid still and metallic the sound of the bells of saint hilaire which had melted not at all in the atmosphere it was so well accustomed to traverse but broken piecemeal by the successive palpitation of all their sonorous strokes throbbed as it brushed the flowers at our feet sometimes at the water's edge and embedded in trees we would come upon a house of the kind called 'pleasure houses ' isolated and lost seeing nothing of the world save the river which bathed its feet a young woman whose pensive face and fashionable veils did not suggest a local origin and who had doubtless come there in the popular phrase 'to bury herself ' to taste the bitter sweetness of feeling that her name and still more the name of him whose heart she had once held but had been unable to keep were unknown there stood framed in a window from which she had no outlook beyond the boat that was moored beside her door she raised her eyes with an air of distraction when she heard through the trees that lined the bank the voices of passers by of whom before they came in sight she might be certain that never had they known nor would they know the faithless lover that nothing in their past lives bore his imprint which nothing in their future would have occasion to receive one felt that in her renunciation of life she had willingly abandoned those places in which she would at least have been able to see him whom she loved for others where he had never trod and i watched her as she returned from some walk along a road where she had known that he would not appear drawing from her submissive fingers long gloves of a precious useless charm never in the course of our walks along the 'guermantes way ' might we penetrate as far as the source of the vivonne of which i had often thought which had in my mind so abstract so ideal an existence that i had been as much surprised when some one told me that it was actually to be found in the same department and at a given number of miles from combray as i had been on the day when i had learned that there was another fixed point somewhere on the earth's surface where according to the ancients opened the jaws of hell nor could we ever reach that other goal to which i longed so much to attain guermantes itself i knew that it was the residence of its proprietors the duc and duchesse de guermantes i knew that they were real personages who did actually exist but whenever i thought about them i pictured them to myself either in tapestry as was the 'coronation of esther' which hung in our church or else in changing rainbow colours as was gilbert the bad in his window where he passed from cabbage green when i was dipping my fingers in the holy water stoup to plum blue when i had reached our row of chairs or again altogether impalpable like the image of geneviève de brabant ancestress of the guermantes family which the magic lantern sent wandering over the curtains of my room or flung aloft upon the ceiling in short always wrapped in the mystery of the merovingian age and bathed as in a sunset in the orange light which glowed from the resounding syllable 'antes ' and if in spite of that they were for me in their capacity as a duke and a duchess real people though of an unfamiliar kind this ducal personality was in its turn enormously distended immaterialised so as to encircle and contain that guermantes of which they were duke and duchess all that sunlit 'guermantes way' of our walks the course of the vivonne its water lilies and its overshadowing trees and an endless series of hot summer afternoons and i knew that they bore not only the titles of duc and duchesse de guermantes but that since the fourteenth century when after vain attempts to conquer its earlier lords in battle they had allied themselves by marriage and so became counts of combray the first citizens consequently of the place and yet the only ones among its citizens who did not reside in it comtes de combray possessing combray threading it on their string of names and titles absorbing it in their personalities and illustrating no doubt in themselves that strange and pious melancholy which was peculiar to combray proprietors of the town though not of any particular house there dwelling presumably out of doors in the street between heaven and earth like that gilbert de guermantes of whom i could see in the stained glass of the apse of saint hilaire only the 'other side' in dull black lacquer if i raised my eyes to look for him when i was going to camus's for a packet of salt and then it happened that going the 'guermantes way ' i passed occasionally by a row of well watered little gardens over whose hedges rose clusters of dark blossom i would stop before them hoping to gain some precious addition to my experience for i seemed to have before my eyes a fragment of that riverside country which i had longed so much to see and know since coming upon a description of it by one of my favourite authors and it was with that story book land with its imagined soil intersected by a hundred bubbling watercourses that guermantes changing its form in my mind became identified after i heard dr percepied speak of the flowers and the charming rivulets and fountains that were to be seen there in the ducal park i used to dream that mme de guermantes taking a sudden capricious fancy for myself invited me there that all day long she stood fishing for trout by my side and when evening came holding my hand in her own as we passed by the little gardens of her vassals she would point out to me the flowers that leaned their red and purple spikes along the tops of the low walls and would teach me all their names she would make me tell her too all about the poems that i meant to compose and these dreams reminded me that since i wished some day to become a writer it was high time to decide what sort of books i was going to write but as soon as i asked myself the question and tried to discover some subjects to which i could impart a philosophical significance of infinite value my mind would stop like a clock i would see before me vacuity nothing would feel either that i was wholly devoid of talent or that perhaps a malady of the brain was hindering its development sometimes i would depend upon my father's arranging everything for me he was so powerful in such favour with the people who 'really counted ' that he made it possible for us to transgress laws which françoise had taught me to regard as more ineluctable than the laws of life and death as when we were allowed to postpone for a year the compulsory repainting of the walls of our house alone among all the houses in that part of paris or when he obtained permission from the minister for mme sazerat's son who had been ordered to some watering place to take his degree two months before the proper time among the candidates whose surnames began with 'a ' instead of having to wait his turn as an 's ' if i had fallen seriously ill if i had been captured by brigands convinced that my father's understanding with the supreme powers was too complete that his letters of introduction to the almighty were too irresistible for my illness or captivity to turn out anything but vain illusions in which there was no danger actually threatening me i should have awaited with perfect composure the inevitable hour of my return to comfortable realities of my deliverance from bondage or restoration to health perhaps this want of talent this black cavity which gaped in my mind when i ransacked it for the theme of my future writings was itself no more either than an unsubstantial illusion and would be brought to an end by the intervention of my father who would arrange with the government and with providence that i should be the first writer of my day but at other times while my parents were growing impatient at seeing me loiter behind instead of following them my actual life instead of seeming an artificial creation by my father and one which he could modify as he chose appeared on the contrary to be comprised in a larger reality which had not been created for my benefit from whose judgments there was no appeal in the heart of which i was bound helpless without friend or ally and beyond which no further possibilities lay concealed it was evident to me then that i existed in the same manner as all other men that i must grow old that i must die like them and that among them i was to be distinguished merely as one of those who have no aptitude for writing and so utterly despondent i renounced literature for ever despite the encouragements that had been given me by bloch this intimate spontaneous feeling this sense of the nullity of my intellect prevailed against all the flattering speeches that might be lavished upon me as a wicked man when everyone is loud in the praise of his good deeds is gnawed by the secret remorse of conscience one day my mother said you are always talking about mme de guermantes well dr percepied did a great deal for her when she was ill four years ago and so she is coming to combray for his daughter's wedding you will be able to see her in church it was from dr percepied as it happened that i had heard most about mme de guermantes and he had even shewn us the number of an illustrated paper in which she was depicted in the costume which she had worn at a fancy dress ball given by the princesse de léon suddenly during the nuptial mass the beadle by moving to one side enabled me to see sitting in a chapel a lady with fair hair and a large nose piercing blue eyes a billowy scarf of mauve silk glossy and new and brilliant and a little spot at the corner of her nose and because on the surface of her face which was red as though she had been very warm i could make out diluted and barely perceptible details which resembled the portrait that had been shewn to me because more especially the particular features which i remarked in this lady if i attempted to catalogue them formulated themselves in precisely the same terms a large nose blue eyes as dr percepied had used when describing in my presence the duchesse de guermantes i said to myself this lady is like the duchesse de guermantes now the chapel from which she was following the service was that of gilbert the bad beneath its flat tombstones yellowed and bulging like cells of honey in a comb rested the bones of the old counts of brabant and i remembered having heard it said that this chapel was reserved for the guermantes family whenever any of its members came to attend a ceremony at combray there was indeed but one woman resembling the portrait of mme de guermantes who on that day the very day on which she was expected to come there could be sitting in that chapel it was she my disappointment was immense it arose from my not having borne in mind when i thought of mme de guermantes that i was picturing her to myself in the colours of a tapestry or a painted window as living in another century as being of another substance than the rest of the human race never had i taken into account that she might have a red face a mauve scarf like mme sazerat and the oval curve of her cheeks reminded me so strongly of people whom i had seen at home that the suspicion brushed against my mind though it was immediately banished that this lady in her creative principle in the molecules of her physical composition was perhaps not substantially the duchesse de guermantes but that her body in ignorance of the name that people had given it belonged to a certain type of femininity which included also the wives of doctors and tradesmen it is it must be mme de guermantes and no one else were the words underlying the attentive and astonished expression with which i was gazing upon this image which naturally enough bore no resemblance to those that had so often under the same title of 'mme de guermantes ' appeared to me in dreams since this one had not been like the others formed arbitrarily by myself but had sprung into sight for the first time only a moment ago here in church an image which was not of the same nature was not colourable at will like those others that allowed themselves to imbibe the orange tint of a sonorous syllable but which was so real that everything even to the fiery little spot at the corner of her nose gave an assurance of her subjection to the laws of life as in a transformation scene on the stage a crease in the dress of a fairy a quivering of her tiny finger indicate the material presence of a living actress before our eyes whereas we were uncertain till then whether we were not looking merely at a projection of limelight from a lantern meanwhile i was endeavouring to apply to this image which the prominent nose the piercing eyes pinned down and fixed in my field of vision perhaps because it was they that had first struck it that had made the first impression on its surface before i had had time to wonder whether the woman who thus appeared before me might possibly be mme de guermantes to this fresh and unchanging image the idea it is mme de guermantes but i succeeded only in making the idea pass between me and the image as though they were two discs moving in separate planes with a space between but this mme de guermantes of whom i had so often dreamed now that i could see that she had a real existence independent of myself acquired a fresh increase of power over my imagination which paralysed for a moment by contact with a reality so different from anything that it had expected began to react and to say within me great and glorious before the days of charlemagne the guermantes had the right of life and death over their vassals the duchesse de guermantes descends from geneviève de brabant she does not know nor would she consent to know any of the people who are here to day and then oh marvellous independence of the human gaze tied to the human face by a cord so loose so long so elastic that it can stray alone as far as it may choose while mme de guermantes sat in the chapel above the tombs of her dead ancestors her gaze lingered here and wandered there rose to the capitals of the pillars and even rested upon myself like a ray of sunlight straying down the nave but a ray of sunlight which at the moment when i received its caress appeared conscious of where it fell as for mme de guermantes herself since she remained there motionless sitting like a mother who affects not to notice the rude or awkward conduct of her children who in the course of their play are speaking to people whom she does not know it was impossible for me to determine whether she approved or condemned the vagrancy of her eyes in the careless detachment of her heart i felt it to be important that she should not leave the church before i had been able to look long enough upon her reminding myself that for years past i had regarded the sight of her as a thing eminently to be desired and i kept my eyes fixed on her as though by gazing at her i should be able to carry away and incorporate to store up for later reference in myself the memory of that prominent nose those red cheeks of all those details which struck me as so much precious authentic unparalleled information with regard to her face and now that whenever i brought my mind to bear upon that face and especially perhaps in my determination that form of the instinct of self preservation with which we guard everything that is best in ourselves not to admit that i had been in any way deceived i found only beauty there setting her once again since they were one and the same person this lady who sat before me and that duchesse de guermantes whom until then i had been used to conjure into an imagined shape apart from and above that common run of humanity with which the sight pure and simple of her in the flesh had made me for a moment confound her i grew indignant when i heard people saying in the congregation round me she is better looking than mme sazerat or than mlle vinteuil as though she had been in any way comparable with them and my gaze resting upon her fair hair her blue eyes the lines of her neck and overlooking the features which might have reminded me of the faces of other women i cried out within myself as i admired this deliberately unfinished sketch how lovely she is what true nobility it is indeed a proud guermantes the descendant of geneviève de brabant that i have before me and the care which i took to focus all my attention upon her face succeeded in isolating it so completely that to day when i call that marriage ceremony to mind i find it impossible to visualise any single person who was present except her and the beadle who answered me in the affirmative when i inquired whether the lady was indeed mme de guermantes but her i can see her still quite clearly especially at the moment when the procession filed into the sacristy lighted by the intermittent hot sunshine of a windy and rainy day where mme de guermantes found herself in the midst of all those combray people whose names even she did not know but whose inferiority proclaimed her own supremacy so loud that she must in return feel for them a genuine pitying sympathy and whom she might count on impressing even more forcibly by virtue of her simplicity and natural charm and then too since she could not bring into play the deliberate glances charged with a definite meaning which one directs in a crowd towards people whom one knows but must allow her vague thoughts to escape continually from her eyes in a flood of blue light which she was powerless to control she was anxious not to distress in any way not to seem to be despising those humbler mortals over whom that current flowed by whom it was everywhere arrested i can see again to day above her mauve scarf silky and buoyant the gentle astonishment in her eyes to which she had added without daring to address it to anyone in particular but so that everyone might enjoy his share of it the almost timid smile of a sovereign lady who seems to be making an apology for her presence among the vassals whom she loves this smile rested upon myself who had never ceased to follow her with my eyes and i remembering the glance which she had let fall upon me during the service blue as a ray of sunlight that had penetrated the window of gilbert the bad said to myself of course she is thinking about me i fancied that i had found favour in her sight that she would continue to think of me after she had left the church and would perhaps grow pensive again that evening at guermantes on my account and at once i fell in love with her for if it is sometimes enough to make us love a woman that she looks on us with contempt as i supposed mlle swann to have done while we imagine that she cannot ever be ours it is enough also sometimes that she looks on us kindly as mme de guermantes did then while we think of her as almost ours already her eyes waxed blue as a periwinkle flower wholly beyond my reach yet dedicated by her to me and the sun bursting out again from behind a threatening cloud and darting the full force of its rays on to the square and into the sacristy shed a geranium glow over the red carpet laid down for the wedding along which mme de guermantes smilingly advanced and covered its woollen texture with a nap of rosy velvet a bloom of light giving it that sort of tenderness of solemn sweetness in the pomp of a joyful celebration which characterises certain pages of lohengrin certain paintings by carpaccio and makes us understand how baudelaire was able to apply to the sound of the trumpet the epithet 'delicious ' how often after that day in the course of my walks along the 'guermantes way ' and with what an intensified melancholy did i reflect on my lack of qualification for a literary career and that i must abandon all hope of ever becoming a famous author the regret that i felt for this while i lingered alone to dream for a little by myself made me suffer so acutely that in order not to feel it my mind of its own accord by a sort of inhibition in the instant of pain ceased entirely to think of verse making of fiction of the poetic future on which my want of talent precluded me from counting then quite apart from all those literary preoccupations and without definite attachment to anything suddenly a roof a gleam of sunlight reflected from a stone the smell of a road would make me stop still to enjoy the special pleasure that each of them gave me and also because they appeared to be concealing beneath what my eyes could see something which they invited me to approach and seize from them but which despite all my efforts i never managed to discover as i felt that the mysterious object was to be found in them i would stand there in front of them motionless gazing breathing endeavouring to penetrate with my mind beyond the thing seen or smelt and if i had then to hasten after my grandfather to proceed on my way i would still seek to recover my sense of them by closing my eyes i would concentrate upon recalling exactly the line of the roof the colour of the stone which without my being able to understand why had seemed to me to be teeming ready to open to yield up to me the secret treasure of which they were themselves no more than the outer coverings it was certainly not any impression of this kind that could or would restore the hope i had lost of succeeding one day in becoming an author and poet for each of them was associated with some material object devoid of any intellectual value and suggesting no abstract truth but at least they gave me an unreasoning pleasure the illusion of a sort of fecundity of mind and in that way distracted me from the tedium from the sense of my own impotence which i had felt whenever i had sought a philosophic theme for some great literary work so urgent was the task imposed on my conscience by these impressions of form or perfume or colour to strive for a perception of what lay hidden beneath them that i was never long in seeking an excuse which would allow me to relax so strenuous an effort and to spare myself the fatigue that it involved as good luck would have it my parents called me i felt that i had not for the moment the calm environment necessary for a successful pursuit of my researches and that it would be better to think no more of the matter until i reached home and not to exhaust myself in the meantime to no purpose and so i concerned myself no longer with the mystery that lay hidden in a form or a perfume quite at ease in my mind since i was taking it home with me protected by its visible and tangible covering beneath which i should find it still alive like the fish which on days when i had been allowed to go out fishing i used to carry back in my basket buried in a couch of grass which kept them cool and fresh once in the house again i would begin to think of something else and so my mind would become littered as my room was with the flowers that i had gathered on my walks or the odds and ends that people had given me with a stone from the surface of which the sunlight was reflected a roof the sound of a bell the smell of fallen leaves a confused mass of different images under which must have perished long ago the reality of which i used to have some foreboding but which i never had the energy to discover and bring to light once however when we had prolonged our walk far beyond its ordinary limits and so had been very glad to encounter half way home as afternoon darkened into evening dr percepied who drove past us at full speed in his carriage saw and recognised us stopped and made us jump in beside him i received an impression of this sort which i did not abandon without having first subjected it to an examination a little more thorough i had been set on the box beside the coachman we were going like the wind because the doctor had still before returning to combray to call at martinville le sec at the house of a patient at whose door he asked us to wait for him at a bend in the road i experienced suddenly that special pleasure which bore no resemblance to any other when i caught sight of the twin steeples of martinville on which the setting sun was playing while the movement of the carriage and the windings of the road seemed to keep them continually changing their position and then of a third steeple that of vieuxvicq which although separated from them by a hill and a valley and rising from rather higher ground in the distance appeared none the less to be standing by their side in ascertaining and noting the shape of their spires the changes of aspect the sunny warmth of their surfaces i felt that i was not penetrating to the full depth of my impression that something more lay behind that mobility that luminosity something which they seemed at once to contain and to conceal the steeples appeared so distant and we ourselves seemed to come so little nearer them that i was astonished when a few minutes later we drew up outside the church of martinville i did not know the reason for the pleasure which i had found in seeing them upon the horizon and the business of trying to find out what that reason was seemed to me irksome i wished only to keep in reserve in my brain those converging lines moving in the sunshine and for the time being to think of them no more and it is probable that had i done so those two steeples would have vanished for ever in a great medley of trees and roofs and scents and sounds which i had noticed and set apart on account of the obscure sense of pleasure which they gave me but without ever exploring them more fully i got down from the box to talk to my parents while we were waiting for the doctor to reappear then it was time to start i climbed up again to my place turning my head to look back once more at my steeples of which a little later i caught a farewell glimpse at a turn in the road the coachman who seemed little inclined for conversation having barely acknowledged my remarks i was obliged in default of other society to fall back on my own and to attempt to recapture the vision of my steeples and presently their outlines and their sunlit surface as though they had been a sort of rind were stripped apart a little of what they had concealed from me became apparent an idea came into my mind which had not existed for me a moment earlier framed itself in words in my head and the pleasure with which the first sight of them just now had filled me was so much enhanced that overpowered by a sort of intoxication i could no longer think of anything but them at this point although we had now travelled a long way from martinville i turned my head and caught sight of them again quite black this time for the sun had meanwhile set every few minutes a turn in the road would sweep them out of sight then they shewed themselves for the last time and so i saw them no more without admitting to myself that what lay buried within the steeples of martinville must be something analogous to a charming phrase since it was in the form of words which gave me pleasure that it had appeared to me i borrowed a pencil and some paper from the doctor and composed in spite of the jolting of the carriage to appease my conscience and to satisfy my enthusiasm the following little fragment which i have since discovered and now reproduce with only a slight revision here and there alone rising from the level of the plain and seemingly lost in that expanse of open country climbed to the sky the twin steeples of martinville presently we saw three springing into position confronting them by a daring volt a third a dilatory steeple that of vieuxvicq was come to join them the minutes passed we were moving rapidly and yet the three steeples were always a long way ahead of us like three birds perched upon the plain motionless and conspicuous in the sunlight then the steeple of vieuxvicq withdrew took its proper distance and the steeples of martinville remained alone gilded by the light of the setting sun which even at that distance i could see playing and smiling upon their sloped sides we had been so long in approaching them that i was thinking of the time that must still elapse before we could reach them when of a sudden the carriage having turned a corner set us down at their feet and they had flung themselves so abruptly in our path that we had barely time to stop before being dashed against the porch of the church we resumed our course we had left martinville some little time and the village after accompanying us for a few seconds had already disappeared when lingering alone on the horizon to watch our flight its steeples and that of vieuxvicq waved once again in token of farewell their sun bathed pinnacles sometimes one would withdraw so that the other two might watch us for a moment still then the road changed direction they veered in the light like three golden pivots and vanished from my gaze but a little later when we were already close to combray the sun having set meanwhile i caught sight of them for the last time far away and seeming no more now than three flowers painted upon the sky above the low line of fields they made me think too of three maidens in a legend abandoned in a solitary place over which night had begun to fall and while we drew away from them at a gallop i could see them timidly seeking their way and after some awkward stumbling movements of their noble silhouettes drawing close to one another slipping one behind another shewing nothing more now against the still rosy sky than a single dusky form charming and resigned and so vanishing in the night i never thought again of this page but at the moment when on my corner of the box seat where the doctor's coachman was in the habit of placing in a hamper the fowls which he had bought at martinville market i had finished writing it i found such a sense of happiness felt that it had so entirely relieved my mind of the obsession of the steeples and of the mystery which they concealed that as though i myself were a hen and had just laid an egg i began to sing at the top of my voice all day long during these walks i had been able to muse upon the pleasure that there would be in the friendship of the duchesse de guermantes in fishing for trout in drifting by myself in a boat on the vivonne and greedy for happiness i asked nothing more from life in such moments than that it should consist always of a series of joyous afternoons but when on our way home i had caught sight of a farm on the left of the road at some distance from two other farms which were themselves close together and from which to return to combray we need only turn down an avenue of oaks bordered on one side by a series of orchard closes each one planted at regular intervals with apple trees which cast upon the ground when they were lighted by the setting sun the japanese stencil of their shadows then sharply my heart would begin to beat i would know that in half an hour we should be at home and that there as was the rule on days when we had taken the 'guermantes way' and dinner was in consequence served later than usual i should be sent to bed as soon as i had swallowed my soup so that my mother kept at table just as though there had been company to dinner would not come upstairs to say good night to me in bed the zone of melancholy which i then entered was totally distinct from that other zone in which i had been bounding for joy a moment earlier just as sometimes in the sky a band of pink is separated as though by a line invisibly ruled from a band of green or black you may see a bird flying across the pink it draws near the border line touches it enters and is lost upon the black the longings by which i had just now been absorbed to go to guermantes to travel to live a life of happiness i was now so remote from them that their fulfilment would have afforded me no pleasure how readily would i have sacrificed them all just to be able to cry all night long in the arms of mamma shuddering with emotion i could not take my agonised eyes from my mother's face which was not to appear that evening in the bedroom where i could see myself already lying in imagination and wished only that i were lying dead and this state would persist until the morrow when the rays of morning leaning their bars of light as the gardener might lean his ladder against the wall overgrown with nasturtiums which clambered up it as far as my window sill i would leap out of bed to run down at once into the garden with no thought of the fact that evening must return and with it the hour when i must leave my mother and so it was from the 'guermantes way' that i learned to distinguish between these states which reigned alternately in my mind during certain periods going so far as to divide every day between them each one returning to dispossess the other with the regularity of a fever and ague contiguous and yet so foreign to one another so devoid of means of communication that i could no longer understand or even picture to myself in one state what i had desired or dreaded or even done in the other so the 'méséglise way' and the 'guermantes way' remain for me linked with many of the little incidents of that one of all the divers lives along whose parallel lines we are moved which is the most abundant in sudden reverses of fortune the richest in episodes i mean the life of the mind doubtless it makes in us an imperceptible progress and the truths which have changed for us its meaning and its aspect which have opened new paths before our feet we had for long been preparing for their discovery but that preparation was unconscious and for us those truths date only from the day from the minute when they became apparent the flowers which played then among the grass the water which rippled past in the sunshine the whole landscape which served as environment to their apparition lingers around the memory of them still with its unconscious or unheeding air and certainly when they were slowly scrutinised by this humble passer by by this dreaming child as the face of a king is scrutinised by a petitioner lost in the crowd that scrap of nature that corner of a garden could never suppose that it would be thanks to him that they would be elected to survive in all their most ephemeral details and yet the scent of hawthorn which strays plundering along the hedge from which in a little while the dog roses will have banished it a sound of footsteps followed by no echo upon a gravel path a bubble formed at the side of a waterplant by the current and formed only to burst my exaltation of mind has borne them with it and has succeeded in making them traverse all these successive years while all around them the one trodden ways have vanished while those who thronged those ways and even the memory of those who thronged those trodden ways are dead sometimes the fragment of landscape thus transported into the present will detach itself in such isolation from all associations that it floats uncertainly upon my mind like a flowering isle of delos and i am unable to say from what place from what time perhaps quite simply from which of my dreams it comes but it is pre eminently as the deepest layer of my mental soil as firm sites on which i still may build that i regard the méséglise and guermantes 'ways ' it is because i used to think of certain things of certain people while i was roaming along them that the things the people which they taught me to know and these alone i still take seriously still give me joy whether it be that the faith which creates has ceased to exist in me or that reality will take shape in the memory alone the flowers that people shew me nowadays for the first time never seem to me to be true flowers the 'méséglise way' with its lilacs its hawthorns its cornflowers its poppies its apple trees the 'guermantes way' with its river full of tadpoles its water lilies and its buttercups have constituted for me for all time the picture of the land in which i fain would pass my life in which my only requirements are that i may go out fishing drift idly in a boat see the ruins of a gothic fortress in the grass and find hidden among the cornfields as saint andré des champs lay hidden an old church monumental rustic and yellow like a mill stone and the cornflowers the hawthorns the apple trees which i may happen when i go walking to encounter in the fields because they are situated at the same depth on the level of my past life at once establish contact with my heart and yet because there is an element of individuality in places when i am seized with a desire to see again the 'guermantes way ' it would not be satisfied were i led to the banks of a river in which were lilies as fair or even fairer than those in the vivonne any more than on my return home in the evening at the hour when there awakened in me that anguish which later on in life transfers itself to the passion of love and may even become its inseparable companion i should have wished for any strange mother to come in and say good night to me though she were far more beautiful and more intelligent than my own no just as the one thing necessary to send me to sleep contented in that untroubled peace which no mistress in later years has ever been able to give me since one has doubts of them at the moment when one believes in them and never can possess their hearts as i used to receive in her kiss the heart of my mother complete without scruple or reservation unburdened by any liability save to myself was that it should be my mother who came that she should incline towards me that face on which there was beneath her eye something that was it appears a blemish and which i loved as much as all the rest so what i want to see again is the 'guermantes way' as i knew it with the farm that stood a little apart from the two neighbouring farms pressed so close together at the entrance to the oak avenue those meadows upon whose surface when it is polished by the sun to the mirroring radiance of a lake are outlined the leaves of the apple trees that whole landscape whose individuality sometimes at night in my dreams binds me with a power that is almost fantastic of which i can discover no trace when i awake no doubt by virtue of having permanently and indissolubly combined in me groups of different impressions for no reason save that they had made me feel several separate things at the same time the méséglise and guermantes 'ways' left me exposed in later life to much disillusionment and even to many mistakes for often i have wished to see a person again without realising that it was simply because that person recalled to me a hedge of hawthorns in blossom and i have been led to believe and to make some one else believe in an aftermath of affection by what was no more than an inclination to travel but by the same qualities and by their persistence in those of my impressions to day to which they can find an attachment the two 'ways' give to those impressions a foundation depth a dimension lacking from the rest they invest them too with a charm a significance which is for me alone when on a summer evening the resounding sky growls like a tawny lion and everyone is complaining of the storm it is along the 'méséglise way' that my fancy strays alone in ecstasy inhaling through the noise of falling rain the odour of invisible and persistent lilac trees and so i would often lie until morning dreaming of the old days at combray of my melancholy and wakeful evenings there of other days besides the memory of which had been more lately restored to me by the taste by what would have been called at combray the 'perfume' of a cup of tea and by an association of memories of a story which many years after i had left the little place had been told me of a love affair in which swann had been involved before i was born with that accuracy of detail which it is easier often to obtain when we are studying the lives of people who have been dead for centuries than when we are trying to chronicle those of our own most intimate friends an accuracy which it seems as impossible to attain as it seemed impossible to speak from one town to another before we learned of the contrivance by which that impossibility has been overcome all these memories following one after another were condensed into a single substance but had not so far coalesced that i could not discern between the three strata between my oldest my instinctive memories those others inspired more recently by a taste or 'perfume ' and those which were actually the memories of another from whom i had acquired them at second hand no fissures indeed no geological faults but at least those veins those streaks of colour which in certain rocks in certain marbles point to differences of origin age and formation it is true that when morning drew near i would long have settled the brief uncertainty of my waking dream i would know in what room i was actually lying would have reconstructed it round about me in the darkness and fixing my orientation by memory alone or with the assistance of a feeble glimmer of light at the foot of which i placed the curtains and the window would have reconstructed it complete and with its furniture as an architect and an upholsterer might do working upon an original discarded plan of the doors and windows would have replaced the mirrors and set the chest of drawers on its accustomed site 'but scarcely had daylight itself and no longer the gleam from a last dying ember on a brass curtain rod which i had mistaken for daylight traced across the darkness as with a stroke of chalk across a blackboard its first white correcting ray when the window with its curtains would leave the frame of the doorway in which i had erroneously placed it while to make room for it the writing table which my memory had clumsily fixed where the window ought to be would hurry off at full speed thrusting before it the mantelpiece and sweeping aside the wall of the passage the well of the courtyard would be enthroned on the spot where a moment earlier my dressing room had lain and the dwelling place which i had built up for myself in the darkness would have gone to join all those other dwellings of which i had caught glimpses from the whirlpool of awakening put to flight by that pale sign traced above my window curtains by the uplifted forefinger of day swann in love to admit you to the 'little nucleus ' the 'little group ' the 'little clan' at the verdurins' one condition sufficed but that one was indispensable you must give tacit adherence to a creed one of whose articles was that the young pianist whom mme verdurin had taken under her patronage that year and of whom she said really it oughtn't to be allowed to play wagner as well as that left both planté and rubinstein 'sitting' while dr cottard was a more brilliant diagnostician than potain each 'new recruit' whom the verdurins failed to persuade that the evenings spent by other people in other houses than theirs were as dull as ditch water saw himself banished forthwith women being in this respect more rebellious than men more reluctant to lay aside all worldly curiosity and the desire to find out for themselves whether other drawing rooms might not sometimes be as entertaining and the verdurins feeling moreover that this critical spirit and this demon of frivolity might by their contagion prove fatal to the orthodoxy of the little church they had been obliged to expel one after another all those of the 'faithful' who were of the female sex apart from the doctor's young wife they were reduced almost exclusively that season for all that mme verdurin herself was a thoroughly 'good' woman and came of a respectable middle class family excessively rich and wholly undistinguished with which she had gradually and of her own accord severed all connection to a young woman almost of a 'certain class ' a mme de crécy whom mme verdurin called by her christian name odette and pronounced a 'love ' and to the pianist's aunt who looked as though she had at one period 'answered the bell' ladies quite ignorant of the world who in their social simplicity were so easily led to believe that the princesse de sagan and the duchesse de guermantes were obliged to pay large sums of money to other poor wretches in order to have anyone at their dinner parties that if somebody had offered to procure them an invitation to the house of either of those great dames the old doorkeeper and the woman of 'easy virtue' would have contemptuously declined the verdurins never invited you to dinner you had your 'place laid' there there was never any programme for the evening's entertainment the young pianist would play but only if he felt inclined for no one was forced to do anything and as m verdurin used to say we're all friends here liberty hall you know if the pianist suggested playing the ride of the valkyries or the prelude to tristan mme verdurin would protest not that the music was displeasing to her but on the contrary that it made too violent an impression then you want me to have one of my headaches you know quite well it's the same every time he plays that i know what i'm in for tomorrow when i want to get up nothing doing if he was not going to play they talked and one of the friends usually the painter who was in favour there that year would spin as m verdurin put it a damned funny yarn that made 'em all split with laughter and especially mme verdurin for whom so strong was her habit of taking literally the figurative accounts of her emotions dr cottard who was then just starting in general practice would really have to come one day and set her jaw which she had dislocated with laughing too much evening dress was barred because you were all 'good pals ' and didn't want to look like the 'boring people' who were to be avoided like the plague and only asked to the big evenings which were given as seldom as possible and then only if it would amuse the painter or make the musician better known the rest of the time you were quite happy playing charades and having supper in fancy dress and there was no need to mingle any strange element with the little 'clan ' but just as the 'good pals' came to take a more and more prominent place in mme verdurin's life so the 'bores ' the 'nuisances' grew to include everybody and everything that kept her friends away from her that made them sometimes plead 'previous engagements ' the mother of one the professional duties of another the 'little place in the country' of a third if dr cottard felt bound to say good night as soon as they rose from table so as to go back to some patient who was seriously ill i don't know mme verdurin would say i'm sure it will do him far more good if you don't go disturbing him again this evening he will have a good night without you to morrow morning you can go round early and you will find him cured from the beginning of december it would make her quite ill to think that the 'faithful' might fail her on christmas and new year's days the pianist's aunt insisted that he must accompany her on the latter to a family dinner at her mother's you don't suppose she'll die your mother exclaimed mme verdurin bitterly if you don't have dinner with her on new year's day like people in the provinces her uneasiness was kindled again in holy week now you doctor you're a sensible broad minded man you'll come of course on good friday just like any other day she said to cottard in the first year of the little 'nucleus ' in a loud and confident voice as though there could be no doubt of his answer but she trembled as she waited for it for if he did not come she might find herself condemned to dine alone i shall come on good friday to say good bye to you for we are going to spend the holidays in auvergne in auvergne to be eaten by fleas and all sorts of creatures a fine lot of good that will do you and after a solemn pause if you had only told us we would have tried to get up a party and all gone there together comfortably and so too if one of the 'faithful' had a friend or one of the ladies a young man who was liable now and then to make them miss an evening the verdurins who were not in the least afraid of a woman's having a lover provided that she had him in their company loved him in their company and did not prefer him to their company would say very well then bring your friend along and he would be put to the test to see whether he was willing to have no secrets from mme verdurin whether he was susceptible of being enrolled in the 'little clan ' if he failed to pass the faithful one who had introduced him would be taken on one side and would be tactfully assisted to quarrel with the friend or mistress but if the test proved satisfactory the newcomer would in turn be numbered among the 'faithful ' and so when in the course of this same year the courtesan told m verdurin that she had made the acquaintance of such a charming gentleman m swann and hinted that he would very much like to be allowed to come m verdurin carried the request at once to his wife he never formed an opinion on any subject until she had formed hers his special duty being to carry out her wishes and those of the 'faithful' generally which he did with boundless ingenuity my dear mme de crécy has something to say to you she would like to bring one of her friends here a m swann what do you say why as if anybody could refuse anything to a little piece of perfection like that be quiet no one asked your opinion i tell you that you are a piece of perfection just as you like replied odette in an affected tone and then went on you know i'm not fishing for compliments very well bring your friend if he's nice now there was no connection whatsoever between the 'little nucleus' and the society which swann frequented and a purely worldly man would have thought it hardly worth his while when occupying so exceptional a position in the world to seek an introduction to the verdurins but swann was so ardent a lover that once he had got to know almost all the women of the aristocracy once they had taught him all that there was to learn he had ceased to regard those naturalisation papers almost a patent of nobility which the faubourg saint germain had bestowed upon him save as a sort of negotiable bond a letter of credit with no intrinsic value which allowed him to improvise a status for himself in some little hole in the country or in some obscure quarter of paris where the good looking daughter of a local squire or solicitor had taken his fancy for at such times desire or love itself would revive in him a feeling of vanity from which he was now quite free in his everyday life although it was no doubt the same feeling which had originally prompted him towards that career as a man of fashion in which he had squandered his intellectual gifts upon frivolous amusements and had made use of his erudition in matters of art only to advise society ladies what pictures to buy and how to decorate their houses and this vanity it was which made him eager to shine in the sight of any fair unknown who had captivated him for the moment with a brilliance which the name of swann by itself did not emit and he was most eager when the fair unknown was in humble circumstances just as it is not by other men of intelligence that an intelligent man is afraid of being thought a fool so it is not by the great gentleman but by boors and 'bounders' that a man of fashion is afraid of finding his social value underrated three fourths of the mental ingenuity displayed of the social falsehoods scattered broadcast ever since the world began by people whose importance they have served only to diminish have been aimed at inferiors and swann who behaved quite simply and was at his ease when with a duchess would tremble for fear of being despised and would instantly begin to pose were he to meet her grace's maid unlike so many people who either from lack of energy or else from a resigned sense of the obligation laid upon them by their social grandeur to remain moored like houseboats to a certain point on the bank of the stream of life abstain from the pleasures which are offered to them above and below that point that degree in life in which they will remain fixed until the day of their death and are content in the end to describe as pleasures for want of any better those mediocre distractions that just not intolerable tedium which is enclosed there with them swann would endeavour not to find charm and beauty in the women with whom he must pass time but to pass his time among women whom he had already found to be beautiful and charming and these were as often as not women whose beauty was of a distinctly 'common' type for the physical qualities which attracted him instinctively and without reason were the direct opposite of those that he admired in the women painted or sculptured by his favourite masters depth of character or a melancholy expression on a woman's face would freeze his senses which would however immediately melt at the sight of healthy abundant rosy human flesh if on his travels he met a family whom it would have been more correct for him to make no attempt to know but among whom a woman caught his eye adorned with a special charm that was new to him to remain on his 'high horse' and to cheat the desire that she had kindled in him to substitute a pleasure different from that which he might have tasted in her company by writing to invite one of his former mistresses to come and join him would have seemed to him as cowardly an abdication in the face of life as stupid a renunciation of a new form of happiness as if instead of visiting the country where he was he had shut himself up in his own rooms and looked at 'views' of paris he did not immure himself in the solid structure of his social relations but had made of them so as to be able to set it up afresh upon new foundations wherever a woman might take his fancy one of those collapsible tents which explorers carry about with them any part of it which was not portable or could not be adapted to some fresh pleasure he would discard as valueless however enviable it might appear to others how often had his credit with a duchess built up of the yearly accumulation of her desire to do him some favour for which she had never found an opportunity been squandered in a moment by his calling upon her in an indiscreetly worded message for a recommendation by telegraph which would put him in touch at once with one of her agents whose daughter he had noticed in the country just as a starving man might barter a diamond for a crust of bread indeed when it was too late he would laugh at himself for it for there was in his nature redeemed by many rare refinements an element of clownishness then he belonged to that class of intelligent men who have led a life of idleness and who seek consolation and perhaps an excuse in the idea which their idleness offers to their intelligence of objects as worthy of their interest as any that could be attained by art or learning the idea that 'life' contains situations more interesting and more romantic than all the romances ever written so at least he would assure and had no difficulty in persuading the more subtle among his friends in the fashionable world notably the baron de charlus whom he liked to amuse with stories of the startling adventures that had befallen him such as when he had met a woman in the train and had taken her home with him before discovering that she was the sister of a reigning monarch in whose hands were gathered at that moment all the threads of european politics of which he found himself kept informed in the most delightful fashion or when in the complexity of circumstances it depended upon the choice which the conclave was about to make whether he might or might not become the lover of somebody's cook it was not only the brilliant phalanx of virtuous dowagers generals and academicians to whom he was bound by such close ties that swann compelled with so much cynicism to serve him as panders all his friends were accustomed to receive from time to time letters which called on them for a word of recommendation or introduction with a diplomatic adroitness which persisting throughout all his successive 'affairs' and using different pretexts revealed more glaringly than the clumsiest indiscretion a permanent trait in his character and an unvarying quest i used often to recall to myself when many years later i began to take an interest in his character because of the similarities which in wholly different respects it offered to my own how when he used to write to my grandfather though not at the time we are now considering for it was about the date of my own birth that swann's great 'affair' began and made a long interruption in his amatory practices the latter recognising his friend's handwriting on the envelope would exclaim here is swann asking for something on guard and either from distrust or from the unconscious spirit of devilry which urges us to offer a thing only to those who do not want it my grandparents would meet with an obstinate refusal the most easily satisfied of his prayers as when he begged them for an introduction to a girl who dined with us every sunday and whom they were obliged whenever swann mentioned her to pretend that they no longer saw although they would be wondering all through the week whom they could invite to meet her and often failed in the end to find anyone sooner than make a sign to him who would so gladly have accepted occasionally a couple of my grandparents' acquaintance who had been complaining for some time that they never saw swann now would announce with satisfaction and perhaps with a slight inclination to make my grandparents envious of them that he had suddenly become as charming as he could possibly be and was never out of their house my grandfather would not care to shatter their pleasant illusion but would look at my grandmother as he hummed the air of what is this mystery i cannot understand it or of vision fugitive in matters such as this 'tis best to close one's eyes a few months later if my grandfather asked swann's new friend what about swann do you still see as much of him as ever the other's face would lengthen never mention his name to me again but i thought that you were such friends he had been intimate in this way for several months with some cousins of my grandmother dining almost every evening at their house suddenly and without any warning he ceased to appear they supposed him to be ill and the lady of the house was going to send to inquire for him when in her kitchen she found a letter in his hand which her cook had left by accident in the housekeeping book in this he announced that he was leaving paris and would not be able to come to the house again the cook had been his mistress and at the moment of breaking off relations she was the only one of the household whom he had thought it necessary to inform but when his mistress for the time being was a woman in society or at least one whose birth was not so lowly nor her position so irregular that he was unable to arrange for her reception in 'society ' then for her sake he would return to it but only to the particular orbit in which she moved or into which he had drawn her no good depending on swann for this evening people would say don't you remember it's his american's night at the opera he would secure invitations for her to the most exclusive drawing rooms to those houses where he himself went regularly for weekly dinners or for poker every evening after a slight 'wave' imparted to his stiffly brushed red locks had tempered with a certain softness the ardour of his bold green eyes he would select a flower for his buttonhole and set out to meet his mistress at the house of one or other of the women of his circle and then thinking of the affection and admiration which the fashionable folk whom he always treated exactly as he pleased would when he met them there lavish upon him in the presence of the woman whom he loved he would find a fresh charm in that worldly existence of which he had grown weary but whose substance pervaded and warmly coloured by the flickering light which he had slipped into its midst seemed to him beautiful and rare now that he had incorporated in it a fresh love but while each of these attachments each of these flirtations had been the realisation more or less complete of a dream born of the sight of a face or a form which swann had spontaneously and without effort on his part found charming it was quite another matter when one day at the theatre he was introduced to odette de crécy by an old friend of his own who had spoken of her to him as a ravishing creature with whom he might very possibly come to an understanding but had made her out to be harder of conquest than she actually was so as to appear to be conferring a special favour by the introduction she had struck swann not certainly as being devoid of beauty but as endowed with a style of beauty which left him indifferent which aroused in him no desire which gave him indeed a sort of physical repulsion as one of those women of whom every man can name some and each will name different examples who are the converse of the type which our senses demand to give him any pleasure her profile was too sharp her skin too delicate her cheek bones too prominent her features too tightly drawn her eyes were fine but so large that they seemed to be bending beneath their own weight strained the rest of her face and always made her appear unwell or in an ill humour some time after this introduction at the theatre she had written to ask swann whether she might see his collections which would interest her so much she an ignorant woman with a taste for beautiful things saying that she would know him better when once she had seen him in his 'home ' where she imagined him to be so comfortable with his tea and his books although she had not concealed her surprise at his being in that part of the town which must be so depressing and was not nearly smart enough for such a very smart man and when he allowed her to come she had said to him as she left how sorry she was to have stayed so short a time in a house into which she was so glad to have found her way at last speaking of him as though he had meant something more to her than the rest of the people she knew and appearing to unite their two selves with a kind of romantic bond which had made him smile but at the time of life tinged already with disenchantment which swann was approaching when a man can content himself with being in love for the pleasure of loving without expecting too much in return this linking of hearts if it is no longer as in early youth the goal towards which love of necessity tends still is bound to love by so strong an association of ideas that it may well become the cause of love if it presents itself first in his younger days a man dreams of possessing the heart of the woman whom he loves later the feeling that he possesses the heart of a woman may be enough to make him fall in love with her and 50 at an age when it would appear since one seeks in love before everything else a subjective pleasure that the taste for feminine beauty must play the larger part in its procreation love may come into being love of the most physical order without any foundation in desire at this time of life a man has already been wounded more than once by the darts of love it no longer evolves by itself obeying its own incomprehensible and fatal laws before his passive and astonished heart we come to its aid we falsify it by memory and by suggestion recognising one of its symptoms we recall and recreate the rest since we possess its hymn engraved on our hearts in its entirety there is no need of any woman to repeat the opening lines potent with the admiration which her beauty inspires for us to remember all that follows and if she begin in the middle where it sings of our existing henceforward for one another only we are well enough attuned to that music to be able to take it up and follow our partner without hesitation at the first pause in her voice odette de crécy came again to see swann her visits grew more frequent and doubtless each visit revived the sense of disappointment which he felt at the sight of a face whose details he had somewhat forgotten in the interval not remembering it as either so expressive or in spite of her youth so faded he used to regret while she was talking to him that her really considerable beauty was not of the kind which he spontaneously admired it must be remarked that odette's face appeared thinner and more prominent than it actually was because her forehead and the upper part of her cheeks a single and almost plane surface were covered by the masses of hair which women wore at that period drawn forward in a fringe raised in crimped waves and falling in stray locks over her ears while as for her figure and she was admirably built it was impossible to make out its continuity on account of the fashion then prevailing and in spite of her being one of the best dressed women in paris for the corset jetting forwards in an arch as though over an imaginary stomach and ending in a sharp point beneath which bulged out the balloon of her double skirts gave a woman that year the appearance of being composed of different sections badly fitted together to such an extent did the frills the flounces the inner bodice follow in complete independence controlled only by the fancy of their designer or the rigidity of their material the line which led them to the knots of ribbon falls of lace fringes of vertically hanging jet or carried them along the bust but nowhere attached themselves to the living creature who according as the architecture of their fripperies drew them towards or away from her own found herself either strait laced to suffocation or else completely buried but after odette had left him swann would think with a smile of her telling him how the time would drag until he allowed her to come again he remembered the anxious timid way in which she had once begged him that it might not be very long and the way in which she had looked at him then fixing upon him her fearful and imploring gaze which gave her a touching air beneath the bunches of artificial pansies fastened in the front of her round bonnet of white straw tied with strings of black velvet and won't you she had ventured come just once and take tea with me he had pleaded pressure of work an essay which in reality he had abandoned years ago on vermeer of delft i know that i am quite useless she had replied a little wild thing like me beside a learned great man like you i should be like the frog in the fable and yet i should so much like to learn to know things to be initiated what fun it would be to become a regular bookworm to bury my nose in a lot of old papers she had gone on with that self satisfied air which a smart woman adopts when she insists that her one desire is to give herself up without fear of soiling her fingers to some unclean task such as cooking the dinner with her hands right in the dish itself you will only laugh at me but this painter who stops you from seeing me she meant vermeer i have never even heard of him is he alive still can i see any of his things in paris so as to have some idea of what is going on behind that great brow which works so hard that head which i feel sure is always puzzling away about things just to be able to say 'there that's what he's thinking about ' what a dream it would be to be able to help you with your work he had sought an excuse in his fear of forming new friendships which he gallantly described as his fear of a hopeless passion you are afraid of falling in love how funny that is when i go about seeking nothing else and would give my soul just to find a little love somewhere she had said so naturally and with such an air of conviction that he had been genuinely touched some woman must have made you suffer and you think that the rest are all like her she can't have understood you you are so utterly different from ordinary men that's what i liked about you when i first saw you i felt at once that you weren't like everybody else and then besides there's yourself he had continued i know what women are you must have a whole heap of things to do and never any time to spare i why i have never anything to do i am always free and i always will be free if you want me at whatever hour of the day or night it may suit you to see me just send for me and i shall be only too delighted to come will you do that do you know what i should really like to introduce you to mme verdurin where i go every evening just fancy my finding you there and thinking that it was a little for my sake that you had gone no doubt in thus remembering their conversations in thinking about her thus when he was alone he did no more than call her image into being among those of countless other women in his romantic dreams but if thanks to some accidental circumstance or even perhaps without that assistance for the circumstance which presents itself at the moment when a mental state hitherto latent makes itself felt may well have had no influence whatsoever upon that state the image of odette de crécy came to absorb the whole of his dreams if from those dreams the memory of her could no longer be eliminated then her bodily imperfections would no longer be of the least importance nor would the conformity of her body more or less than any other to the requirements of swann's taste since having become the body of her whom he loved it must henceforth be the only one capable of causing him joy or anguish it so happened that my grandfather had known which was more than could be said of any other actual acquaintance the family of these verdurins but he had entirely severed his connection with what he called young verdurin taking a general view of him as one who had fallen though without losing hold of his millions among the riff raff of bohemia one day he received a letter from swann asking whether my grandfather could put him in touch with the verdurins on guard on guard he exclaimed as he read it i am not at all surprised swann was bound to finish up like this a nice lot of people i cannot do what he asks because in the first place i no longer know the gentleman in question besides there must be a woman in it somewhere and i don't mix myself up in such matters ah well we shall see some fun if swann begins running after the little verdurins and on my grandfather's refusal to act as sponsor it was odette herself who had taken swann to the house the verdurins had had dining with them on the day when swann made his first appearance dr and mme cottard the young pianist and his aunt and the painter then in favour while these were joined in the course of the evening by several more of the 'faithful ' dr cottard was never quite certain of the tone in which he ought to reply to any observation or whether the speaker was jesting or in earnest and so in any event he would embellish all his facial expressions with the offer of a conditional a provisional smile whose expectant subtlety would exonerate him from the charge of being a simpleton if the remark addressed to him should turn out to have been facetious but as he must also be prepared to face the alternative he never dared to allow this smile a definite expression on his features and you would see there a perpetually flickering uncertainty in which you might decipher the question that he never dared to ask do you really mean that he was no more confident of the manner in which he ought to conduct himself in the street or indeed in life generally than he was in a drawing room and he might be seen greeting passers by carriages and anything that occurred with a malicious smile which absolved his subsequent behaviour of all impropriety since it proved if it should turn out unsuited to the occasion that he was well aware of that and that if he had assumed a smile the jest was a secret of his own on all those points however where a plain question appeared to him to be permissible the doctor was unsparing in his endeavours to cultivate the wilderness of his ignorance and uncertainty and so to complete his education so it was that following the advice given him by a wise mother on his first coming up to the capital from his provincial home he would never let pass either a figure of speech or a proper name that was new to him without an effort to secure the fullest information upon it as regards figures of speech he was insatiable in his thirst for knowledge for often imagining them to have a more definite meaning than was actually the case he would want to know what exactly was intended by those which he most frequently heard used 'devilish pretty ' 'blue blood ' 'a cat and dog life ' 'a day of reckoning ' 'a queen of fashion 'to give a free hand ' 'to be at a deadlock ' and so forth and in what particular circumstances he himself might make use of them in conversation failing these he would adorn it with puns and other 'plays upon words' which he had learned by rote as for the names of strangers which were uttered in his hearing he used merely to repeat them to himself in a questioning tone which he thought would suffice to furnish him with explanations for which he would not ostensibly seek as the critical faculty on the universal application of which he prided himself was in reality completely lacking that refinement of good breeding which consists in assuring some one whom you are obliging in any way without expecting to be believed that it is really yourself that is obliged to him was wasted on cottard who took everything that he heard in its literal sense however blind she may have been to his faults mme verdurin was genuinely annoyed though she still continued to regard him as brilliantly clever when after she had invited him to see and hear sarah bernhardt from a stage box and had said politely it is very good of you to have come doctor especially as i'm sure you must often have heard sarah bernhardt and besides i'm afraid we're rather too near the stage the doctor who had come into the box with a smile which waited before settling upon or vanishing from his face until some one in authority should enlighten him as to the merits of the spectacle replied to be sure we are far too near the stage and one is getting sick of sarah bernhardt but you expressed a wish that i should come for me your wish is a command i am only too glad to be able to do you this little service what would one not do to please you you are so good and he went on sarah bernhardt that's what they call the voice of god ain't it you see often too that she 'sets the boards on fire ' that's an odd expression ain't it in the hope of an enlightening commentary which however was not forthcoming d'you know mme verdurin had said to her husband i believe we are going the wrong way to work when we depreciate anything we offer the doctor he is a scientist who lives quite apart from our everyday existence he knows nothing himself of what things are worth and he accepts everything that we say as gospel i never dared to mention it m verdurin had answered but i've noticed the same thing myself and on the following new year's day instead of sending dr cottard a ruby that cost three thousand francs and pretending that it was a mere trifle m verdurin bought an artificial stone for three hundred and let it be understood that it was something almost impossible to match when mme verdurin had announced that they were to see m swann that evening swann the doctor had exclaimed in a tone rendered brutal by his astonishment for the smallest piece of news would always take utterly unawares this man who imagined himself to be perpetually in readiness for anything and seeing that no one answered him swann who on earth is swann he shouted in a frenzy of anxiety which subsided as soon as mme verdurin had explained why odette's friend whom she told us about ah good good that's all right then answered the doctor at once mollified as for the painter he was overjoyed at the prospect of swann's appearing at the verdurins' because he supposed him to be in love with odette and was always ready to assist at lovers' meetings nothing amuses me more than match making he confided to cottard i have been tremendously successful even with women in telling the verdurins that swann was extremely 'smart ' odette had alarmed them with the prospect of another 'bore ' when he arrived however he made an excellent impression an indirect cause of which though they did not know it was his familiarity with the best society he had indeed one of those advantages which men who have lived and moved in the world enjoy over others even men of intelligence and refinement who have never gone into society namely that they no longer see it transfigured by the longing or repulsion with which it fills the imagination but regard it as quite unimportant their good nature freed from all taint of snobbishness and from the fear of seeming too friendly grown independent in fact has the ease the grace of movement of a trained gymnast each of whose supple limbs will carry out precisely the movement that is required without any clumsy participation by the rest of his body the simple and elementary gestures used by a man of the world when he courteously holds out his hand to the unknown youth who is being introduced to him and when he bows discreetly before the ambassador to whom he is being introduced had gradually pervaded without his being conscious of it the whole of swann's social deportment so that in the company of people of a lower grade than his own such as the verdurins and their friends he instinctively shewed an assiduity and made overtures with which by their account any of their 'bores' would have dispensed he chilled though for a moment only on meeting dr cottard for seeing him close one eye with an ambiguous smile before they had yet spoken to one another a grimace which cottard styled letting 'em all come swann supposed that the doctor recognised him from having met him already somewhere probably in some house of 'ill fame ' though these he himself very rarely visited never having made a habit of indulging in the mercenary sort of love regarding such an allusion as in bad taste especially before odette whose opinion of himself it might easily alter for the worse swann assumed his most icy manner but when he learned that the lady next to the doctor was mme cottard he decided that so young a husband would not deliberately in his wife's hearing have made any allusion to amusements of that order and so ceased to interpret the doctor's expression in the sense which he had at first suspected the painter at once invited swann to visit his studio with odette and swann found him very pleasant perhaps you will be more highly favoured than i have been mme verdurin broke in with mock resentment of the favour perhaps you will be allowed to see cottard's portrait for which she had given the painter a commission take care master biche she reminded the painter whom it was a time honoured pleasantry to address as 'master ' to catch that nice look in his eyes that witty little twinkle you know what i want to have most of all is his smile that's what i've asked you to paint the portrait of his smile and since the phrase struck her as noteworthy she repeated it very loud so as to make sure that as many as possible of her guests should hear it and even made use of some indefinite pretext to draw the circle closer before she uttered it again swann begged to be introduced to everyone even to an old friend of the verdurins called saniette whose shyness simplicity and good nature had deprived him of all the consideration due to his skill in palaeography his large fortune and the distinguished family to which he belonged when he spoke his words came with a confusion which was delightful to hear because one felt that it indicated not so much a defect in his speech as a quality of his soul as it were a survival from the age of innocence which he had never wholly outgrown all the consonants which he did not manage to pronounce seemed like harsh utterances of which his gentle lips were incapable by asking to be made known to m saniette swann made m verdurin reverse the usual form of introduction saying in fact with emphasis on the distinction m swann pray let me present to you our friend saniette but he aroused in saniette himself a warmth of gratitude which however the verdurins never disclosed to swann since saniette rather annoyed them and they did not feel bound to provide him with friends on the other hand the verdurins were extremely touched by swann's next request for he felt that he must ask to be introduced to the pianist's aunt she wore a black dress as was her invariable custom for she believed that a woman always looked well in black and that nothing could be more distinguished but her face was exceedingly red as it always was for some time after a meal she bowed to swann with deference but drew herself up again with great dignity as she was entirely uneducated and was afraid of making mistakes in grammar and pronunciation she used purposely to speak in an indistinct and garbling manner thinking that if she should make a slip it would be so buried in the surrounding confusion that no one could be certain whether she had actually made it or not with the result that her talk was a sort of continuous blurred expectoration out of which would emerge at rare intervals those sounds and syllables of which she felt positive swann supposed himself entitled to poke a little mild fun at her in conversation with m verdurin who however was not at all amused she is such an excellent woman he rejoined i grant you that she is not exactly brilliant but i assure you that she can talk most charmingly when you are alone with her i am sure she can swann hastened to conciliate him all i meant was that she hardly struck me as 'distinguished ' he went on isolating the epithet in the inverted commas of his tone and after all that is something of a compliment wait a moment said m verdurin now this will surprise you she writes quite delightfully you have never heard her nephew play it is admirable eh doctor would you like me to ask him to play something m swann i should count myself most fortunate swann was beginning a trifle pompously when the doctor broke in derisively having once heard it said and never having forgotten that in general conversation emphasis and the use of formal expressions were out of date whenever he heard a solemn word used seriously as the word 'fortunate' had been used just now by swann he at once assumed that the speaker was being deliberately pedantic and if moreover the same word happened to occur also in what he called an old 'tag' or 'saw ' however common it might still be in current usage the doctor jumped to the conclusion that the whole thing was a joke and interrupted with the remaining words of the quotation which he seemed to charge the speaker with having intended to introduce at that point although in reality it had never entered his mind most fortunate for france he recited wickedly shooting up both arms with great vigour m verdurin could not help laughing what are all those good people laughing at over there there's no sign of brooding melancholy down in your corner shouted mme verdurin you don't suppose i find it very amusing to be stuck up here by myself on the stool of repentance she went on peevishly like a spoiled child mme verdurin was sitting upon a high swedish chair of waxed pine wood which a violinist from that country had given her and which she kept in her drawing room although in appearance it suggested a school 'form ' and 'swore ' as the saying is at the really good antique furniture which she had besides but she made a point of keeping on view the presents which her 'faithful' were in the habit of making her from time to time so that the donors might have the pleasure of seeing them there when they came to the house she tried to persuade them to confine their tributes to flowers and sweets which had at least the merit of mortality but she was never successful and the house was gradually filled with a collection of foot warmers cushions clocks screens barometers and vases a constant repetition and a boundless incongruity of useless but indestructible objects from this lofty perch she would take her spirited part in the conversation of the 'faithful ' and would revel in all their fun but since the accident to her jaw she had abandoned the effort involved in real hilarity and had substituted a kind of symbolical dumb show which signified without endangering or even fatiguing her in any way that she was 'laughing until she cried ' at the least witticism aimed by any of the circle against a 'bore ' or against a former member of the circle who was now relegated to the limbo of 'bores' and to the utter despair of m verdurin who had always made out that he was just as easily amused as his wife but who since his laughter was the 'real thing ' was out of breath in a moment and so was overtaken and vanquished by her device of a feigned but continuous hilarity she would utter a shrill cry shut tight her little bird like eyes which were beginning to be clouded over by a cataract and quickly as though she had only just time to avoid some indecent sight or to parry a mortal blow burying her face in her hands which completely engulfed it and prevented her from seeing anything at all she would appear to be struggling to suppress to eradicate a laugh which were she to give way to it must inevitably leave her inanimate so stupefied with the gaiety of the 'faithful ' drunken with comradeship scandal and asseveration mme verdurin perched on her high seat like a cage bird whose biscuit has been steeped in mulled wine would sit aloft and sob with fellow feeling meanwhile m verdurin after first asking swann's permission to light his pipe no ceremony here you understand we're all pals went and begged the young musician to sit down at the piano leave him alone don't bother him he hasn't come here to be tormented cried mme verdurin i won't have him tormented but why on earth should it bother him rejoined m verdurin i'm sure m swann has never heard the sonata in f sharp which we discovered he is going to play us the pianoforte arrangement no no no not my sonata she screamed i don't want to be made to cry until i get a cold in the head and neuralgia all down my face like last time thanks very much i don't intend to repeat that performance you are all very kind and considerate it is easy to see that none of you will have to stay in bed for a week this little scene which was re enacted as often as the young pianist sat down to play never failed to delight the audience as though each of them were witnessing it for the first time as a proof of the seductive originality of the 'mistress' as she was styled and of the acute sensitiveness of her musical 'ear ' those nearest to her would attract the attention of the rest who were smoking or playing cards at the other end of the room by their cries of 'hear hear ' which as in parliamentary debates shewed that something worth listening to was being said and next day they would commiserate with those who had been prevented from coming that evening and would assure them that the 'little scene' had never been so amusingly done well all right then said m verdurin he can play just the andante just the andante how you do go on cried his wife as if it weren't 'just the andante ' that breaks every bone in my body the 'master' is really too priceless just as though 'in the ninth ' he said 'we need only have the finale ' or 'just the overture' of the meistersinger the doctor however urged mme verdurin to let the pianist play not because he supposed her to be malingering when she spoke of the distressing effects that music always had upon her for he recognised the existence of certain neurasthenic states but from his habit common to many doctors of at once relaxing the strict letter of a prescription as soon as it appeared to jeopardise what seemed to him far more important the success of some social gathering at which he was present and of which the patient whom he had urged for once to forget her dyspepsia or headache formed an essential factor you won't be ill this time you'll find he told her seeking at the same time to subdue her mind by the magnetism of his gaze and if you are ill we will cure you will you really mme verdurin spoke as though with so great a favour in store for her there was nothing for it but to capitulate perhaps too by dint of saying that she was going to be ill she had worked herself into a state in which she forgot occasionally that it was all only a 'little scene ' and regarded things quite sincerely from an invalid's point of view for it may often be remarked that invalids grow weary of having the frequency of their attacks depend always on their own prudence in avoiding them and like to let themselves think that they are free to do everything that they most enjoy doing although they are always ill after doing it provided only that they place themselves in the hands of a higher authority which without putting them to the least inconvenience can and will by uttering a word or by administering a tabloid set them once again upon their feet odette had gone to sit on a tapestry covered sofa near the piano saying to mme verdurin i have my own little corner haven't i and mme verdurin seeing swann by himself upon a chair made him get up you're not at all comfortable there go along and sit by odette you can make room for m swann there can't you odette what charming beauvais said swann stopping to admire the sofa before he sat down on it and wishing to be polite i am glad you appreciate my sofa replied mme verdurin and i warn you that if you expect ever to see another like it you may as well abandon the idea at once they never made any more like it and these little chairs too are perfect marvels you can look at them in a moment the emblems in each of the bronze mouldings correspond to the subject of the tapestry on the chair you know you combine amusement with instruction when you look at them i can promise you a delightful time i assure you just look at the little border around the edges here look the little vine on a red background in this one the bear and the grapes isn't it well drawn what do you say i think they knew a thing or two about design doesn't it make your mouth water this vine my husband makes out that i am not fond of fruit because i eat less than he does but not a bit of it i am greedier than any of you but i have no need to fill my mouth with them when i can feed on them with my eyes what are you all laughing at now pray ask the doctor he will tell you that those grapes act on me like a regular purge some people go to fontainebleau for cures i take my own little beauvais cure here but m swann you mustn't run away without feeling the little bronze mouldings on the backs isn't it an exquisite surface no no not with your whole hand like that feel them properly if mme verdurin is going to start playing about with her bronzes said the painter we shan't get any music to night be quiet you wretch and yet we poor women she went on are forbidden pleasures far less voluptuous than this there is no flesh in the world as soft as these none when m verdurin did me the honour of being madly jealous come you might at least be polite don't say that you never have been jealous but my dear i have said absolutely nothing look here doctor i call you as a witness did i utter a word swann had begun out of politeness to finger the bronzes and did not like to stop come along you can caress them later now it is you that are going to be caressed caressed in the ear you'll like that i think here's the young gentleman who will take charge of that after the pianist had played swann felt and shewed more interest in him than in any of the other guests for the following reason the year before at an evening party he had heard a piece of music played on the piano and violin at first he had appreciated only the material quality of the sounds which those instruments secreted and it had been a source of keen pleasure when below the narrow ribbon of the violin part delicate unyielding substantial and governing the whole he had suddenly perceived where it was trying to surge upwards in a flowing tide of sound the mass of the piano part multiform coherent level and breaking everywhere in melody like the deep blue tumult of the sea silvered and charmed into a minor key by the moonlight but at a given moment without being able to distinguish any clear outline or to give a name to what was pleasing him suddenly enraptured he had tried to collect to treasure in his memory the phrase or harmony he knew not which that had just been played and had opened and expanded his soul just as the fragrance of certain roses wafted upon the moist air of evening has the power of dilating our nostrils perhaps it was owing to his own ignorance of music that he had been able to receive so confused an impression one of those that are notwithstanding our only purely musical impressions limited in their extent entirely original and irreducible into any other kind an impression of this order vanishing in an instant is so to speak an impression sine materia presumably the notes which we hear at such moments tend to spread out before our eyes over surfaces greater or smaller according to their pitch and volume to trace arabesque designs to give us the sensation of breadth or tenuity stability or caprice but the notes themselves have vanished before these sensations have developed sufficiently to escape submersion under those which the following or even simultaneous notes have already begun to awaken in us and this indefinite perception would continue to smother in its molten liquidity the motifs which now and then emerge barely discernible to plunge again and disappear and drown recognised only by the particular kind of pleasure which they instil impossible to describe to recollect to name ineffable if our memory like a labourer who toils at the laying down of firm foundations beneath the tumult of the waves did not by fashioning for us facsimiles of those fugitive phrases enable us to compare and to contrast them with those that follow and so hardly had the delicious sensation which swann had experienced died away before his memory had furnished him with an immediate transcript summary it is true and provisional but one on which he had kept his eyes fixed while the playing continued so effectively that when the same impression suddenly returned it was no longer uncapturable he was able to picture to himself its extent its symmetrical arrangement its notation the strength of its expression he had before him that definite object which was no longer pure music but rather design architecture thought and which allowed the actual music to be recalled this time he had distinguished quite clearly a phrase which emerged for a few moments from the waves of sound it had at once held out to him an invitation to partake of intimate pleasures of whose existence before hearing it he had never dreamed into which he felt that nothing but this phrase could initiate him and he had been filled with love for it as with a new and strange desire with a slow and rhythmical movement it led him here there everywhere towards a state of happiness noble unintelligible yet clearly indicated and then suddenly having reached a certain point from which he was prepared to follow it after pausing for a moment abruptly it changed its direction and in a fresh movement more rapid multiform melancholy incessant sweet it bore him off with it towards a vista of joys unknown then it vanished he hoped with a passionate longing that he might find it again a third time and reappear it did though without speaking to him more clearly bringing him indeed a pleasure less profound but when he was once more at home he needed it he was like a man into whose life a woman whom he has seen for a moment passing by has brought a new form of beauty which strengthens and enlarges his own power of perception without his knowing even whether he is ever to see her again whom he loves already although he knows nothing of her not even her name indeed this passion for a phrase of music seemed in the first few months to be bringing into swann's life the possibility of a sort of rejuvenation he had so long since ceased to direct his course towards any ideal goal and had confined himself to the pursuit of ephemeral satisfactions that he had come to believe though without ever formally stating his belief even to himself that he would remain all his life in that condition which death alone could alter more than this since his mind no longer entertained any lofty ideals he had ceased to believe in although he could not have expressly denied their reality he had grown also into the habit of taking refuge in trivial considerations which allowed him to set on one side matters of fundamental importance just as he had never stopped to ask himself whether he would not have done better by not going into society knowing very well that if he had accepted an invitation he must put in an appearance and that afterwards if he did not actually call he must at least leave cards upon his hostess so in his conversation he took care never to express with any warmth a personal opinion about a thing but instead would supply facts and details which had a value of a sort in themselves and excused him from shewing how much he really knew he would be extremely precise about the recipe for a dish the dates of a painter's birth and death and the titles of his works sometimes in spite of himself he would let himself go so far as to utter a criticism of a work of art or of some one's interpretation of life but then he would cloak his words in a tone of irony as though he did not altogether associate himself with what he was saying but now like a confirmed invalid whom all of a sudden a change of air and surroundings or a new course of treatment or as sometimes happens an organic change in himself spontaneous and unaccountable seems to have so far recovered from his malady that he begins to envisage the possibility hitherto beyond all hope of starting to lead and better late than never a wholly different life swann found in himself in the memory of the phrase that he had heard in certain other sonatas which he had made people play over to him to see whether he might not perhaps discover his phrase among them the presence of one of those invisible realities in which he had ceased to believe but to which as though the music had had upon the moral barrenness from which he was suffering a sort of recreative influence he was conscious once again of a desire almost indeed of the power to consecrate his life but never having managed to find out whose work it was that he had heard played that evening he had been unable to procure a copy and finally had forgotten the quest he had indeed in the course of the next few days encountered several of the people who had been at the party with him and had questioned them but most of them had either arrived after or left before the piece was played some had indeed been in the house but had gone into another room to talk and those who had stayed to listen had no clearer impression than the rest as for his hosts they knew that it was a recently published work which the musicians whom they had engaged for the evening had asked to be allowed to play but as these last were now on tour somewhere swann could learn nothing further he had of course a number of musical friends but vividly as he could recall the exquisite and inexpressible pleasure which the little phrase had given him and could see still before his eyes the forms that it had traced in outline he was quite incapable of humming over to them the air and so at last he ceased to think of it but to night at mme verdurin's scarcely had the little pianist begun to play when suddenly after a high note held on through two whole bars swann saw it approaching stealing forth from underneath that resonance which was prolonged and stretched out over it like a curtain of sound to veil the mystery of its birth and recognised secret whispering articulate the airy and fragrant phrase that he had loved and it was so peculiarly itself it had so personal a charm which nothing else could have replaced that swann felt as though he had met in a friend's drawing room a woman whom he had seen and admired once in the street and had despaired of ever seeing her again finally the phrase withdrew and vanished pointing directing diligent among the wandering currents of its fragrance leaving upon swann's features a reflection of its smile but now at last he could ask the name of his fair unknown and was told that it was the andante movement of vinteuil's sonata for the piano and violin he held it safe could have it again to himself at home as often as he would could study its language and acquire its secret and so when the pianist had finished swann crossed the room and thanked him with a vivacity which delighted mme verdurin isn't he charming she asked swann doesn't he just understand it his sonata the little wretch you never dreamed did you that a piano could be made to express all that upon my word there's everything in it except the piano i'm caught out every time i hear it i think i'm listening to an orchestra though it's better really than an orchestra more complete the young pianist bent over her as he answered smiling and underlining each of his words as though he were making an epigram you are most generous to me and while mme verdurin was saying to her husband run and fetch him a glass of orangeade it's well earned swann began to tell odette how he had fallen in love with that little phrase when their hostess who was a little way off called out well it looks to me as though some one was saying nice things to you odette she replied yes very nice and he found her simplicity delightful then he asked for some information about this vinteuil what else he had done and at what period in his life he had composed the sonata what meaning the little phrase could have had for him that was what swann wanted most to know but none of these people who professed to admire this musician when swann had said that the sonata was really charming mme verdurin had exclaimed i quite believe it charming indeed but you don't dare to confess that you don't know vinteuil's sonata you have no right not to know it and the painter had gone on with ah yes it's a very fine bit of work isn't it not of course if you want something 'obvious ' something 'popular ' but i mean to say it makes a very great impression on us artists none of them seemed ever to have asked himself these questions for none of them was able to reply even to one or two particular remarks made by swann on his favourite phrase d'you know that's a funny thing i had never noticed it i may as well tell you that i don't much care about peering at things through a microscope and pricking myself on pin points of difference no we don't waste time splitting hairs in this house why not well it's not a habit of ours that's all mme verdurin replied while dr cottard gazed at her with open mouthed admiration and yearned to be able to follow her as she skipped lightly from one stepping stone to another of her stock of ready made phrases both he however and mme cottard with a kind of common sense which is shared by many people of humble origin would always take care not to express an opinion or to pretend to admire a piece of music which they would confess to each other once they were safely at home that they no more understood than they could understand the art of 'master' biche inasmuch as the public cannot recognise the charm the beauty even the outlines of nature save in the stereotyped impressions of an art which they have gradually assimilated while an original artist starts by rejecting those impressions so m and mme cottard typical in this respect of the public were incapable of finding either in vinteuil's sonata or in biche's portraits what constituted harmony for them in music or beauty in painting it appeared to them when the pianist played his sonata as though he were striking haphazard from the piano a medley of notes which bore no relation to the musical forms to which they themselves were accustomed and that the painter simply flung the colours haphazard upon his canvas when on one of these they were able to distinguish a human form they always found it coarsened and vulgarised that is to say lacking all the elegance of the school of painting through whose spectacles they themselves were in the habit of seeing the people real living people who passed them in the streets and devoid of truth as though m biche had not known how the human shoulder was constructed or that a woman's hair was not ordinarily purple and yet when the 'faithful' were scattered out of earshot the doctor felt that the opportunity was too good to be missed and so while mme verdurin was adding a final word of commendation of vinteuil's sonata like a would be swimmer who jumps into the water so as to learn but chooses a moment when there are not too many people looking on yes indeed he's what they call a musician di primo cartello he exclaimed with a sudden determination swann discovered no more than that the recent publication of vinteuil's sonata had caused a great stir among the most advanced school of musicians but that it was still unknown to the general public i know some one quite well called vinteuil said swann thinking of the old music master at combray who had taught my grandmother's sisters perhaps that's the man cried mme verdurin oh no swann burst out laughing if you had ever seen him for a moment you wouldn't put the question then to put the question is to solve the problem the doctor suggested but it may well be some relative swann went on that would be bad enough but after all there is no reason why a genius shouldn't have a cousin who is a silly old fool and if that should be so i swear there's no known or unknown form of torture i wouldn't undergo to get the old fool to introduce me to the man who composed the sonata starting with the torture of the old fool's company which would be ghastly the painter understood that vinteuil was seriously ill at the moment and that dr potain despaired of his life what cried mme verdurin do people still call in potain ah mme verdurin cottard simpered you forget that you are speaking of one of my colleagues i should say one of my masters the painter had heard somewhere that vinteuil was threatened with the loss of his reason and he insisted that signs of this could be detected in certain passages in the sonata this remark did not strike swann as ridiculous rather it puzzled him for since a purely musical work contains none of those logical sequences the interruption or confusion of which in spoken or written language is a proof of insanity so insanity diagnosed in a sonata seemed to him as mysterious a thing as the insanity of a dog or a horse although instances may be observed of these don't speak to me about 'your masters' you know ten times as much as he does mme verdurin answered dr cottard in the tone of a woman who has the courage of her convictions and is quite ready to stand up to anyone who disagrees with her anyhow you don't kill your patients but madame he is in the academy the doctor smiled with bitter irony if a sick person prefers to die at the hands of one of the princes of science it is far more smart to be able to say 'yes i have potain ' oh indeed more smart is it said mme verdurin so there are fashions nowadays in illness are there i didn't know that oh you do make me laugh she screamed suddenly burying her face in her hands and here was i poor thing talking quite seriously and never seeing that you were pulling my leg as for m verdurin finding it rather a strain to start laughing again over so small a matter he was content with puffing out a cloud of smoke from his pipe while he reflected sadly that he could never again hope to keep pace with his wife in her atalanta flights across the field of mirth d'you know we like your friend so very much said mme verdurin later when odette was bidding her good night he is so unaffected quite charming if they're all like that the friends you want to bring here by all means bring them m verdurin remarked that swann had failed all the same to appreciate the pianist's aunt i dare say he felt a little strange poor man suggested mme verdurin you can't expect him to catch the tone of the house the first time he comes like cottard who has been one of our little 'clan' now for years the first time doesn't count it's just for looking round and finding out things odette he understands all right he's to join us to morrow at the châtelet perhaps you might call for him and bring him no he doesn't want that oh very well just as you like provided he doesn't fail us at the last moment greatly to mme verdurin's surprise he never failed them he would go to meet them no matter where at restaurants outside paris not that they went there much at first for the season had not yet begun and more frequently at the play in which mme verdurin delighted one evening when they were dining at home he heard her complain that she had not one of those permits which would save her the trouble of waiting at doors and standing in crowds and say how useful it would be to them at first nights and gala performances at the opera and what a nuisance it had been not having one on the day of gambetta's funeral swann never spoke of his distinguished friends but only of such as might be regarded as detrimental whom therefore he thought it snobbish and in not very good taste to conceal while he frequented the faubourg saint germain he had come to include in the latter class all his friends in the official world of the third republic and so broke in without thinking i'll see to that all right you shall have it in time for the danicheff revival i shall be lunching with the prefect of police to morrow as it happens at the elysée what's that the elysée dr cottard roared in a voice of thunder yes at m grévy's replied swann feeling a little awkward at the effect which his announcement had produced are you often taken like that the painter asked cottard with mock seriousness as a rule once an explanation had been given cottard would say ah good good that's all right then after which he would shew not the least trace of emotion but this time swann's last words instead of the usual calming effect had that of heating instantly to boiling point his astonishment at the discovery that a man with whom he himself was actually sitting at table a man who had no official position no honours or distinction of any sort was on visiting terms with the head of the state what's that you say m grévy do you know m grévy he demanded of swann in the stupid and incredulous tone of a constable on duty at the palace when a stranger has come up and asked to see the president of the republic until guessing from his words and manner what as the newspapers say 'it is a case of ' he assures the poor lunatic that he will be admitted at once and points the way to the reception ward of the police infirmary i know him slightly we have some friends in common swann dared not add that one of these friends was the prince of wales anyhow he is very free with his invitations and i assure you his luncheon parties are not the least bit amusing they're very simple affairs too you know never more than eight at table he went on trying desperately to cut out everything that seemed to shew off his relations with the president in a light too dazzling for the doctor's eyes whereupon cottard at once conforming in his mind to the literal interpretation of what swann was saying decided that invitations from m grévy were very little sought after were sent out in fact into the highways and hedge rows and from that moment he never seemed at all surprised to hear that swann or anyone else was 'always at the elysée' he even felt a little sorry for a man who had to go to luncheon parties which he himself admitted were a bore ah good good that's quite all right then he said in the tone of a customs official who has been suspicious up to now but after hearing your explanations stamps your passport and lets you proceed on your journey without troubling to examine your luggage i can well believe you don't find them amusing those parties indeed it's very good of you to go to them said mme verdurin who regarded the president of the republic only as a 'bore' to be especially dreaded since he had at his disposal means of seduction and even of compulsion which if employed to captivate her 'faithful ' might easily make them 'fail ' it seems he's as deaf as a post and eats with his fingers upon my word then it can't be much fun for you going there a note of pity sounded in the doctor's voice and then struck by the number only eight at table are these luncheons what you would describe as 'intimate' he inquired briskly not so much out of idle curiosity as in his linguistic zeal but so great and glorious a figure was the president of the french republic in the eyes of dr cottard that neither the modesty of swann nor the spite of mme verdurin could ever wholly efface that first impression and he never sat down to dinner with the verdurins without asking anxiously d'you think we shall see m swann here this evening he is a personal friend of m grévy's i suppose that means he's what you'd call a 'gentleman' he even went to the length of offering swann a card of invitation to the dental exhibition this will let you in and anyone you take with you he explained but dogs are not admitted i'm just warning you you understand because some friends of mine went there once who hadn't been told and there was the devil to pay as for m verdurin he did not fail to observe the distressing effect upon his wife of the discovery that swann had influential friends of whom he had never spoken if no arrangement had been made to 'go anywhere ' it was at the verdurins' that swann would find the 'little nucleus' assembled but he never appeared there except in the evenings and would hardly ever accept their invitations to dinner in spite of odette's entreaties i could dine with you alone somewhere if you'd rather she suggested but what about mme verdurin oh that's quite simple i need only say that my dress wasn't ready or that my cab came late there is always some excuse how charming of you but swann said to himself that if he could make odette feel by consenting to meet her only after dinner that there were other pleasures which he preferred to that of her company then the desire that she felt for his would be all the longer in reaching the point of satiety besides as he infinitely preferred to odette's style of beauty that of a little working girl as fresh and plump as a rose with whom he happened to be simultaneously in love he preferred to spend the first part of the evening with her knowing that he was sure to see odette later on for the same reason he would never allow odette to call for him at his house to take him on to the verdurins' the little girl used to wait not far from his door at a street corner rémi his coachman knew where to stop she would jump in beside him and hold him in her arms until the carriage drew up at the verdurins' he would enter the drawing room and there while mme verdurin pointing to the roses which he had sent her that morning said i am furious with you and sent him to the place kept for him by the side of odette the pianist would play to them for their two selves and for no one else that little phrase by vinteuil which was so to speak the national anthem of their love he began always with a sustained tremolo from the violin part which for several bars was unaccompanied and filled all the foreground until suddenly it seemed to be drawn aside and just as in those interiors by pieter de hooch where the subject is set back a long way through the narrow framework of a half opened door infinitely remote in colour quite different velvety with the radiance of some intervening light the little phrase appeared dancing pastoral interpolated episodic belonging to another world it passed with simple and immortal movements scattering on every side the bounties of its grace smiling ineffably still but swann thought that he could now discern in it some disenchantment it seemed to be aware how vain how hollow was the happiness to which it shewed the way in its airy grace there was indeed something definitely achieved and complete in itself like the mood of philosophic detachment which follows an outburst of vain regret but little did that matter to him he looked upon the sonata less in its own light as what it might express had in fact expressed to a certain musician ignorant that any swann or odette anywhere in the world existed when he composed it and would express to all those who should hear it played in centuries to come than as a pledge a token of his love which made even the verdurins and their little pianist think of odette and at the same time of himself which bound her to him by a lasting tie and at that point he had whimsically entreated by odette abandoned the idea of getting some 'professional' to play over to him the whole sonata of which he still knew no more than this one passage why do you want the rest she had asked him our little bit that's all we need he went farther agonised by the reflection at the moment when it passed by him so near and yet so infinitely remote that while it was addressed to their ears it knew them not he would regret almost that it had a meaning of its own an intrinsic and unalterable beauty foreign to themselves just as in the jewels given to us or even in the letters written to us by a woman with whom we are in love we find fault with the 'water' of a stone or with the words of a sentence because they are not fashioned exclusively from the spirit of a fleeting intimacy and of a 'lass unparalleled ' it would happen as often as not that he had stayed so long outside with his little girl before going to the verdurins' that as soon as the little phrase had been rendered by the pianist swann would discover that it was almost time for odette to go home he used to take her back as far as the door of her little house in the rue la pérouse behind the arc de triomphe and it was perhaps on this account and so as not to demand the monopoly of her favours that he sacrificed the pleasure not so essential to his well being of seeing her earlier in the evening of arriving with her at the verdurins' to the exercise of this other privilege for which she was grateful of their leaving together a privilege which he valued all the more because thanks to it he had the feeling that no one else would see her no one would thrust himself between them no one could prevent him from remaining with her in spirit after he had left her for the night and so night after night she would be taken home in swann's carriage and one night after she had got down and while he stood at the gate and murmured till to morrow then she turned impulsively from him plucked a last lingering chrysanthemum in the tiny garden which flanked the pathway from the street to her house and as he went back to his carriage thrust it into his hand he held it pressed to his lips during the drive home and when in due course the flower withered locked it away like something very precious in a secret drawer of his desk he would escort her to her gate but no farther twice only had he gone inside to take part in the ceremony of such vital importance in her life of 'afternoon tea ' the loneliness and emptiness of those short streets consisting almost entirely of low roofed houses self contained but not detached their monotony interrupted here and there by the dark intrusion of some sinister little shop at once an historical document and a sordid survival from the days when the district was still one of ill repute the snow which had lain on the garden beds or clung to the branches of the trees the careless disarray of the season the assertion in this man made city of a state of nature had all combined to add an element of mystery to the warmth the flowers the luxury which he had found inside passing by on his left hand side and on what although raised some way above the street was the ground floor of the house odette's bedroom which looked out to the back over another little street running parallel with her own he had climbed a staircase that went straight up between dark painted walls from which hung oriental draperies strings of turkish beads and a huge japanese lantern suspended by a silken cord from the ceiling which last however so that her visitors should not have to complain of the want of any of the latest comforts of western civilisation was lighted by a gas jet inside to the two drawing rooms large and small these were entered through a narrow lobby the wall of which chequered with the lozenges of a wooden trellis such as you see on garden walls only gilded was lined from end to end by a long rectangular box in which bloomed as though in a hothouse a row of large chrysanthemums at that time still uncommon though by no means so large as the mammoth blossoms which horticulturists have since succeeded in making grow swann was irritated as a rule by the sight of these flowers which had then been 'the rage' in paris for about a year but it had pleased him on this occasion to see the gloom of the little lobby shot with rays of pink and gold and white by the fragrant petals of these ephemeral stars which kindle their cold fires in the murky atmosphere of winter afternoons odette had received him in a tea gown of pink silk which left her neck and arms bare she had made him sit down beside her in one of the many mysterious little retreats which had been contrived in the various recesses of the room sheltered by enormous palmtrees growing out of pots of chinese porcelain or by screens upon which were fastened photographs and fans and bows of ribbon she had said at once you're not comfortable there wait a minute i'll arrange things for you and with a titter of laughter the complacency of which implied that some little invention of her own was being brought into play she had installed behind his head and beneath his feet great cushions of japanese silk which she pummelled and buffeted as though determined to lavish on him all her riches and regardless of their value but when her footman began to come into the room bringing one after another the innumerable lamps which contained mostly in porcelain vases burned singly or in pairs upon the different pieces of furniture as upon so many altars rekindling in the twilight already almost nocturnal of this winter afternoon the glow of a sunset more lasting more roseate more human filling perhaps with romantic wonder the thoughts of some solitary lover wandering in the street below and brought to a standstill before the mystery of the human presence which those lighted windows at once revealed and screened from sight she had kept an eye sharply fixed on the servant to see whether he set each of the lamps down in the place appointed it she felt that if he were to put even one of them where it ought not to be the general effect of her drawing room would be destroyed and that her portrait which rested upon a sloping easel draped with plush would not catch the light and so with feverish impatience she followed the man's clumsy movements scolding him severely when he passed too close to a pair of beaupots which she made a point of always tidying herself in case the plants should be knocked over and went across to them now to make sure that he had not broken off any of the flowers she found something 'quaint' in the shape of each of her chinese ornaments and also in her orchids the cattleyas especially these being with chrysanthemums her favourite flowers because they had the supreme merit of not looking in the least like other flowers but of being made apparently out of scraps of silk or satin it looks just as though it had been cut out of the lining of my cloak she said to swann pointing to an orchid with a shade of respect in her voice for so 'smart' a flower for this distinguished unexpected sister whom nature had suddenly bestowed upon her so far removed from her in the scale of existence and yet so delicate so refined so much more worthy than many real women of admission to her drawing room as she drew his attention now to the fiery tongued dragons painted upon a bowl or stitched upon a fire screen now to a fleshy cluster of orchids now to a dromedary of inlaid silver work with ruby eyes which kept company upon her mantelpiece with a toad carved in jade she would pretend now to be shrinking from the ferocity of the monsters or laughing at their absurdity now blushing at the indecency of the flowers now carried away by an irresistible desire to run across and kiss the toad and dromedary calling them 'darlings ' and these affectations were in sharp contrast to the sincerity of some of her attitudes notably her devotion to our lady of the laghetto who had once when odette was living at nice cured her of a mortal illness and whose medal in gold she always carried on her person attributing to it unlimited powers she poured out swann's tea inquired lemon or cream and on his answering cream please went on smiling a cloud and as he pronounced it excellent you see i know just how you like it this tea had indeed seemed to swann just as it seemed to her something precious and love is so far obliged to find some justification for itself some guarantee of its duration in pleasures which on the contrary would have no existence apart from love and must cease with its passing that when he left her at seven o'clock to go and dress for the evening all the way home sitting bolt upright in his brougham unable to repress the happiness with which the afternoon's adventure had filled him he kept on repeating to himself what fun it would be to have a little woman like that in a place where one could always be certain of finding what one never can be certain of finding a really good cup of tea an hour or so later he received a note from odette and at once recognised that florid handwriting in which an affectation of british stiffness imposed an apparent discipline upon its shapeless characters significant perhaps to less intimate eyes than his of an untidiness of mind a fragmentary education a want of sincerity and decision swann had left his cigarette case at her house why she wrote did you not forget your heart also i should never have let you have that back more important perhaps was a second visit which he paid her a little later on his way to the house as always when he knew that they were to meet he formed a picture of her in his mind and the necessity if he was to find any beauty in her face of fixing his eyes on the fresh and rosy protuberance of her cheekbones and of shutting out all the rest of those cheeks which were so often languorous and sallow except when they were punctuated with little fiery spots plunged him in acute depression as proving that one's ideal is always unattainable and one's actual happiness mediocre he was taking her an engraving which she had asked to see she was not very well she received him wearing a wrapper of mauve crêpe de chine which draped her bosom like a mantle with a richly embroidered web as she stood there beside him brushing his cheek with the loosened tresses of her hair bending one knee in what was almost a dancer's pose so that she could lean without tiring herself over the picture at which she was gazing with bended head out of those great eyes which seemed so weary and so sullen when there was nothing to animate her swann was struck by her resemblance to the figure of zipporah jethro's daughter which is to be seen in one of the sistine frescoes he had always found a peculiar fascination in tracing in the paintings of the old masters not merely the general characteristics of the people whom he encountered in his daily life but rather what seems least susceptible of generalisation the individual features of men and women whom he knew as for instance in a bust of the doge loredan by antonio rizzo the prominent cheekbones the slanting eyebrows in short a speaking likeness to his own coachman rémi in the colouring of a ghirlandaio the nose of m de palancy in a portrait by tintoretto the invasion of the plumpness of the cheek by an outcrop of whisker the broken nose the penetrating stare the swollen eyelids of dr du boulbon perhaps because he had always regretted in his heart that he had confined his attention to the social side of life had talked always rather than acted he felt that he might find a sort of indulgence bestowed upon him by those great artists in his perception of the fact that they also had regarded with pleasure and had admitted into the canon of their works such types of physiognomy as give those works the strongest possible certificate of reality and trueness to life a modern almost a topical savour perhaps also he had so far succumbed to the prevailing frivolity of the world of fashion that he felt the necessity of finding in an old masterpiece some such obvious and refreshing allusion to a person about whom jokes could be made and repeated and enjoyed to day perhaps on the other hand he had retained enough of the artistic temperament to be able to find a genuine satisfaction in watching these individual features take on a more general significance when he saw them uprooted and disembodied in the abstract idea of similarity between an historic portrait and a modern original whom it was not intended to represent however that might be and perhaps because the abundance of impressions which he for some time past had been receiving though indeed they had come to him rather through the channel of his appreciation of music had enriched his appetite for painting as well it was with an unusual intensity of pleasure a pleasure destined to have a lasting effect upon his character and conduct that swann remarked odette's resemblance to the zipporah of that alessandro de mariano to whom one shrinks from giving his more popular surname now that 'botticelli' suggests not so much the actual work of the master as that false and banal conception of it which has of late obtained common currency he no longer based his estimate of the merit of odette's face on the more or less good quality of her cheeks and the softness and sweetness as of carnation petals which he supposed would greet his lips there should he ever hazard an embrace but regarded it rather as a skein of subtle and lovely silken threads which his gazing eyes collected and wound together following the curving line from the skein to the ball where he mingled the cadence of her neck with the spring of her hair and the droop of her eyelids as though from a portrait of herself in which her type was made clearly intelligible he stood gazing at her traces of the old fresco were apparent in her face and limbs and these he tried incessantly afterwards to recapture both when he was with odette and when he was only thinking of her in her absence and albeit his admiration for the florentine masterpiece was probably based upon his discovery that it had been reproduced in her the similarity enhanced her beauty also and rendered her more precious in his sight swann reproached himself with his failure hitherto to estimate at her true worth a creature whom the great sandro would have adored and counted himself fortunate that his pleasure in the contemplation of odette found a justification in his own system of aesthetic he told himself that in choosing the thought of odette as the inspiration of his dreams of ideal happiness he was not as he had until then supposed falling back merely upon an expedient of doubtful and certainly inadequate value since she contained in herself what satisfied the utmost refinement of his taste in art he failed to observe that this quality would not naturally avail to bring odette into the category of women whom he found desirable simply because his desires had always run counter to his aesthetic taste the words 'florentine painting' were invaluable to swann they enabled him gave him as it were a legal title to introduce the image of odette into a world of dreams and fancies which until then she had been debarred from entering and where she assumed a new and nobler form and whereas the mere sight of her in the flesh by perpetually reviving his misgivings as to the quality of her face her figure the whole of her beauty used to cool the ardour of his love those misgivings were swept away and that love confirmed now that he could re erect his estimate of her on the sure foundations of his aesthetic principles while the kiss the bodily surrender which would have seemed natural and but moderately attractive had they been granted him by a creature of somewhat withered flesh and sluggish blood coming as now they came to crown his adoration of a masterpiece in a gallery must it seemed prove as exquisite as they would be supernatural and when he was tempted to regret that for months past he had done nothing but visit odette he would assure himself that he was not unreasonable in giving up much of his time to the study of an inestimably precious work of art cast for once in a new a different an especially charming metal in an unmatched exemplar which he would contemplate at one moment with the humble spiritual disinterested mind of an artist at another with the pride the selfishness the sensual thrill of a collector on his study table at which he worked he had placed as it were a photograph of odette a reproduction of jethro's daughter he would gaze in admiration at the large eyes the delicate features in which the imperfection of her skin might be surmised the marvellous locks of hair that fell along her tired cheeks and adapting what he had already felt to be beautiful on aesthetic grounds to the idea of a living woman he converted it into a series of physical merits which he congratulated himself on finding assembled in the person of one whom he might ultimately possess the vague feeling of sympathy which attracts a spectator to a work of art now that he knew the type in warm flesh and blood of jethro's daughter became a desire which more than compensated thenceforward for that with which odette's physical charms had at first failed to inspire him when he had sat for a long time gazing at the botticelli he would think of his own living botticelli who seemed all the lovelier in contrast and as he drew towards him the photograph of zipporah he would imagine that he was holding odette against his heart it was not only odette's indifference however that he must take pains to circumvent it was also not infrequently his own feeling that since odette had had every facility for seeing him she seemed no longer to have very much to say to him when they did meet he was afraid lest the manner at once trivial monotonous and seemingly unalterable which she now adopted when they were together should ultimately destroy in him that romantic hope that a day might come when she would make avowal of her passion by which hope alone he had become and would remain her lover and so to alter to give a fresh moral aspect to that odette of whose unchanging mood he was afraid of growing weary he wrote suddenly a letter full of hinted discoveries and feigned indignation which he sent off so that it should reach her before dinner time he knew that she would be frightened and that she would reply and he hoped that when the fear of losing him clutched at her heart it would force from her words such as he had never yet heard her utter and he was right by repeating this device he had won from her the most affectionate letters that she had so far written him one of them which she had sent to him at midday by a special messenger from the maison dorée it was the day of the paris murcie fête given for the victims of the recent floods in murcia beginning my dear my hand trembles so that i can scarcely write and these letters he had kept in the same drawer as the withered chrysanthemum or else if she had not had time to write when he arrived at the verdurins' she would come running up to him with an i've something to say to you and he would gaze curiously at the revelation in her face and speech of what she had hitherto kept concealed from him of her heart even as he drew near to the verdurins' door and caught sight of the great lamp lit spaces of the drawing room windows whose shutters were never closed he would begin to melt at the thought of the charming creature whom he would see as he entered the room basking in that golden light here and there the figures of the guests stood out sharp and black between lamp and window shutting off the light like those little pictures which one sees sometimes pasted here and there upon a glass screen whose other panes are mere transparencies he would try to make out odette and then when he was once inside without thinking his eyes sparkled suddenly with such radiant happiness that m verdurin said to the painter h'm seems to be getting warm indeed her presence gave the house what none other of the houses that he visited seemed to possess a sort of tactual sense a nervous system which ramified into each of its rooms and sent a constant stimulus to his heart and so the simple and regular manifestations of a social organism namely the 'little clan ' were transformed for swann into a series of daily encounters with odette and enabled him to feign indifference to the prospect of seeing her or even a desire not to see her in doing which he incurred no very great risk since even although he had written to her during the day he would of necessity see her in the evening and accompany her home but one evening when irritated by the thought of that inevitable dark drive together he had taken his other 'little girl' all the way to the bois so as to delay as long as possible the moment of his appearance at the verdurins' he was so late in reaching them that odette supposing that he did not intend to come had already left seeing the room bare of her swann felt his heart wrung by sudden anguish he shook with the sense that he was being deprived of a pleasure whose intensity he began then for the first time to estimate having always hitherto had that certainty of finding it whenever he would which as in the case of all our pleasures reduced if it did not altogether blind him to its dimensions did you notice the face he pulled when he saw that she wasn't here m verdurin asked his wife i think we may say that he's hooked the face he pulled exploded dr cottard who having left the house for a moment to visit a patient had just returned to fetch his wife and did not know whom they were discussing d'you mean to say you didn't meet him on the doorstep the loveliest of swanns no m swann has been here just for a moment we had a glimpse of a swann tremendously agitated in a state of nerves you see odette had left you mean to say that she has gone the 'whole hog' with him that she has 'burned her boats' inquired the doctor cautiously testing the meaning of his phrases why of course not there's absolutely nothing in it in fact between you and me i think she's making a great mistake and behaving like a silly little fool which she is incidentally come come come said m verdurin how on earth do you know that there's 'nothing in it' we haven't been there to see have we now she would have told me answered mme verdurin with dignity i may say that she tells me everything as she has no one else at present i told her that she ought to live with him she makes out that she can't she admits she was immensely attracted by him at first but he's always shy with her and that makes her shy with him besides she doesn't care for him in that way she says it's an ideal love 'platonic ' you know she's afraid of rubbing the bloom off oh i don't know half the things she says how should i and yet he's exactly the sort of man she wants i beg to differ from you m verdurin courteously interrupted i am only half satisfied with the gentleman i feel that he 'poses ' mme verdurin's whole body stiffened her eyes stared blankly as though she had suddenly been turned into a statue a device by means of which she might be supposed not to have caught the sound of that unutterable word which seemed to imply that it was possible for people to 'pose' in her house and therefore that there were people in the world who 'mattered more' than herself anyhow if there is nothing in it i don't suppose it's because our friend believes in her virtue and yet you never know he seems to believe in her intelligence i don't know whether you heard the way he lectured her the other evening about vinteuil's sonata i am devoted to odette but really to expound theories of aesthetic to her the man must be a prize idiot look here i won't have you saying nasty things about odette broke in mme verdurin in her 'spoiled child' manner she is charming there's no reason why she shouldn't be charming we are not saying anything nasty about her only that she is not the embodiment of either virtue or intellect after all he turned to the painter does it matter so very much whether she is virtuous or not you can't tell she might be a great deal less charming if she were on the landing swann had run into the verdurins' butler who had been somewhere else a moment earlier when he arrived and who had been asked by odette to tell swann but that was at least an hour ago that she would probably stop to drink a cup of chocolate at prévost's on her way home swann set off at once for prévost's but every few yards his carriage was held up by others or by people crossing the street loathsome obstacles each of which he would gladly have crushed beneath his wheels were it not that a policeman fumbling with a note book would delay him even longer than the actual passage of the pedestrian he counted the minutes feverishly adding a few seconds to each so as to be quite certain that he had not given himself short measure and so possibly exaggerated whatever chance there might actually be of his arriving at prévost's in time and of finding her still there and then in a moment of illumination like a man in a fever who awakes from sleep and is conscious of the absurdity of the dream shapes among which his mind has been wandering without any clear distinction between himself and them swann suddenly perceived how foreign to his nature were the thoughts which he had been revolving in his mind ever since he had heard at the verdurins' that odette had left how novel the heartache from which he was suffering but of which he was only now conscious as though he had just woken up what all this disturbance simply because he would not see odette now till to morrow exactly what he had been hoping not an hour before as he drove toward mme verdurin's he was obliged to admit also that now as he sat in the same carriage and drove to prévost's he was no longer the same man was no longer alone even but that a new personality was there beside him adhering to him amalgamated with him a creature from whom he might perhaps be unable to liberate himself towards whom he might have to adopt some such stratagem as one uses to outwit a master or a malady and yet during this last moment in which he had felt that another a fresh personality was thus conjoined with his own life had seemed somehow more interesting it was in vain that he assured himself that this possible meeting at prévost's the tension of waiting for which so ravished stripped so bare the intervening moments that he could find nothing not one idea not one memory in his mind beneath which his troubled spirit might take shelter and repose would probably after all should it take place be much the same as all their meetings of no great importance as on every other evening once he was in odette's company once he had begun to cast furtive glances at her changing countenance and instantly to withdraw his eyes lest she should read in them the first symbols of desire and believe no more in his indifference he would cease to be able even to think of her so busy would he be in the search for pretexts which would enable him not to leave her immediately and to assure himself without betraying his concern that he would find her again next evening at the verdurins' pretexts that is to say which would enable him to prolong for the time being and to renew for one day more the disappointment the torturing deception that must always come to him with the vain presence of this woman whom he might approach yet never dared embrace she was not at prevost's he must search for her then in every restaurant upon the boulevards to save time while he went in one direction he sent in the other his coachman rémi rizzo's doge loredan for whom he presently after a fruitless search found himself waiting at the spot where the carriage was to meet him it did not appear and swann tantalised himself with alternate pictures of the approaching moment as one in which rémi would say to him sir the lady is there or as one in which rémi would say to him sir the lady was not in any of the cafés and so he saw himself faced by the close of his evening a thing uniform and yet bifurcated by the intervening accident which would either put an end to his agony by discovering odette or would oblige him to abandon any hope of finding her that night to accept the necessity of returning home without having seen her the coachman returned but as he drew up opposite him swann asked not did you find the lady but remind me to morrow to order in some more firewood i am sure we must be running short perhaps he had persuaded himself that if rémi had at last found odette in some café where she was waiting for him still then his night of misery was already obliterated by the realisation begun already in his mind of a night of joy and that there was no need for him to hasten towards the attainment of a happiness already captured and held in a safe place which would not escape his grasp again but it was also by the force of inertia there was in his soul that want of adaptability which can be seen in the bodies of certain people who when the moment comes to avoid a collision to snatch their clothes out of reach of a flame or to perform any other such necessary movement take their time as the saying is begin by remaining for a moment in their original position as though seeking to find in it a starting point a source of strength and motion and probably if the coachman had interrupted him with i have found the lady he would have answered oh yes of course that's what i told you to do i had quite forgotten and would have continued to discuss his supply of firewood so as to hide from his servant the emotion that he had felt and to give himself time to break away from the thraldom of his anxieties and abandon himself to pleasure the coachman came back however with the report that he could not find her anywhere and added the advice as an old and privileged servant i think sir that all we can do now is to go home but the air of indifference which swann could so lightly assume when rémi uttered his final unalterable response fell from him like a cast off cloak when he saw rémi attempt to make him abandon hope and retire from the quest certainly not he exclaimed we must find the lady it is most important she would be extremely put out it's a business matter and vexed with me if she didn't see me but i do not see how the lady can be vexed sir answered rémi since it was she that went away without waiting for you sir and said she was going to prévost's and then wasn't there meanwhile the restaurants were closing and their lights began to go out under the trees of the boulevards there were still a few people strolling to and fro barely distinguishable in the gathering darkness now and then the ghost of a woman glided up to swann murmured a few words in his ear asked him to take her home and left him shuddering anxiously he explored every one of these vaguely seen shapes as though among the phantoms of the dead in the realms of darkness he had been searching for a lost eurydice among all the methods by which love is brought into being among all the agents which disseminate that blessed bane there are few so efficacious as the great gust of agitation which now and then sweeps over the human spirit for then the creature in whose company we are seeking amusement at the moment her lot is cast her fate and ours decided that is the creature whom we shall henceforward love it is not necessary that she should have pleased us up till then any more or even as much as others all that is necessary is that our taste for her should become exclusive and that condition is fulfilled so soon as in the moment when she has failed to meet us for the pleasure which we were on the point of enjoying in her charming company is abruptly substituted an anxious torturing desire whose object is the creature herself an irrational absurd desire which the laws of civilised society make it impossible to satisfy and difficult to assuage the insensate agonising desire to possess her swann made rémi drive him to such restaurants as were still open it was the sole hypothesis now of that happiness which he had contemplated so calmly he no longer concealed his agitation the price he set upon their meeting and promised in case of success to reward his coachman as though by inspiring in him a will to triumph which would reinforce his own he could bring it to pass by a miracle that odette assuming that she had long since gone home to bed might yet be found seated in some restaurant on the boulevards he pursued the quest as far as the maison dorée burst twice into tortoni's and still without catching sight of her was emerging from the café anglais striding with haggard gaze towards his carriage which was waiting for him at the corner of the boulevard des italiens when he collided with a person coming in the opposite direction it was odette she explained later that there had been no room at prévost's that she had gone instead to sup at the maison dorée and had been sitting there in an alcove where he must have overlooked her and that she was now looking for her carriage she had so little expected to see him that she started back in alarm as for him he had ransacked the streets of paris not that he supposed it possible that he should find her but because he would have suffered even more cruelly by abandoning the attempt but now the joy which his reason had never ceased to assure him was not that evening at least to be realised was suddenly apparent and more real than ever before for he himself had contributed nothing to it by anticipating probabilities it remained integral and external to himself there was no need for him to draw on his own resources to endow it with truth 'twas from itself that there emanated 'twas itself that projected towards him that truth whose glorious rays melted and scattered like the cloud of a dream the sense of loneliness which had lowered over him that truth upon which he had supported nay founded albeit unconsciously his vision of bliss so will a traveller who has come down on a day of glorious weather to the mediterranean shore and is doubtful whether they still exist those lands which he has left let his eyes be dazzled rather than cast a backward glance by the radiance streaming towards him from the luminous and unfading azure at his feet he climbed after her into the carriage which she had kept waiting and ordered his own to follow she had in her hand a bunch of cattleyas and swann could see beneath the film of lace that covered her head more of the same flowers fastened to a swansdown plume she was wearing under her cloak a flowing gown of black velvet caught up on one side so as to reveal a large triangular patch of her white silk skirt with an 'insertion ' also of white silk in the cleft of her low necked bodice in which were fastened a few more cattleyas she had scarcely recovered from the shock which the sight of swann had given her when some obstacle made the horse start to one side they were thrown forward from their seats she uttered a cry and fell back quivering and breathless it's all right he assured her don't be frightened and he slipped his arm round her shoulder supporting her body against his own then went on whatever you do don't utter a word just make a sign yes or no or you'll be out of breath again you won't mind if i put the flowers straight on your bodice the jolt has loosened them i'm afraid of their dropping out i'm just going to fasten them a little more securely she was not used to being treated with so much formality by men and smiled as she answered no not at all i don't mind in the least but he chilled a little by her answer perhaps also to bear out the pretence that he had been sincere in adopting the stratagem or even because he was already beginning to believe that he had been exclaimed no no you mustn't speak you will be out of breath again you can easily answer in signs i shall understand really and truly now you don't mind my doing this look there is a little i think it must be pollen spilt over your dress may i brush it off with my hand that's not too hard i'm not hurting you am i i'm tickling you perhaps a little but i don't want to touch the velvet in case i rub it the wrong way but don't you see i really had to fasten the flowers they would have fallen out if i hadn't like that now if i just push them a little farther down seriously i'm not annoying you am i and if i just sniff them to see whether they've really lost all their scent i don't believe i ever smelt any before may i tell the truth now still smiling she shrugged her shoulders ever so slightly as who should say you're quite mad you know very well that i like it he slipped his other hand upwards along odette's cheek she fixed her eyes on him with that languishing and solemn air which marks the women of the old florentine's paintings in whose faces he had found the type of hers swimming at the brink of her fringed lids her brilliant eyes large and finely drawn as theirs seemed on the verge of breaking from her face and rolling down her cheeks like two great tears she bent her neck as all their necks may be seen to bend in the pagan scenes as well as in the scriptural and although her attitude was doubtless habitual and instinctive one which she knew to be appropriate to such moments and was careful not to forget to assume she seemed to need all her strength to hold her face back as though some invisible force were drawing it down towards swann's and swann it was who before she allowed her face as though despite her efforts to fall upon his lips held it back for a moment longer at a little distance between his hands he had intended to leave time for her mind to overtake her body's movements to recognise the dream which she had so long cherished and to assist at its realisation like a mother invited as a spectator when a prize is given to the child whom she has reared and loves perhaps moreover swann himself was fixing upon these features of an odette not yet possessed not even kissed by him on whom he was looking now for the last time that comprehensive gaze with which on the day of his departure a traveller strives to bear away with him in memory the view of a country to which he may never return but he was so shy in approaching her that after this evening which had begun by his arranging her cattleyas and had ended in her complete surrender whether from fear of chilling her or from reluctance to appear even retrospectively to have lied or perhaps because he lacked the audacity to formulate a more urgent requirement than this which could always be repeated since it had not annoyed her on the first occasion he resorted to the same pretext on the following days if she had any cattleyas pinned to her bodice he would say it is most unfortunate the cattleyas don't need tucking in this evening they've not been disturbed as they were the other night i think though that this one isn't quite straight may i see if they have more scent than the others or else if she had none oh no cattleyas this evening then there's nothing for me to arrange so that for some time there was no change from the procedure which he had followed on that first evening when he had started by touching her throat with his fingers first and then with his lips but their caresses began invariably with this modest exploration and long afterwards when the arrangement or rather the ritual pretence of an arrangement of her cattleyas had quite fallen into desuetude the metaphor do a cattleya transmuted into a simple verb which they would employ without a thought of its original meaning when they wished to refer to the act of physical possession in which paradoxically the possessor possesses nothing survived to commemorate in their vocabulary the long forgotten custom from which it sprang and yet possibly this particular manner of saying to make love had not the precise significance of its synonyms however disillusioned we may be about women however we may regard the possession of even the most divergent types as an invariable and monotonous experience every detail of which is known and can be described in advance it still becomes a fresh and stimulating pleasure if the women concerned be or be thought to be so difficult as to oblige us to base our attack upon some unrehearsed incident in our relations with them as was originally for swann the arrangement of the cattleyas he trembled as he hoped that evening but odette he told himself if she were deceived by his stratagem could not guess his intention that it was the possession of this woman that would emerge for him from their large and richly coloured petals and the pleasure which he already felt and which odette tolerated he thought perhaps only because she was not yet aware of it herself seemed to him for that reason as it might have seemed to the first man when he enjoyed it amid the flowers of the earthly paradise a pleasure which had never before existed which he was striving now to create a pleasure and the special name which he was to give to it preserved its identity entirely individual and new the ice once broken every evening when he had taken her home he must follow her into the house and often she would come out again in her dressing gown and escort him to his carriage and would kiss him before the eyes of his coachman saying what on earth does it matter what people see and on evenings when he did not go to the verdurins' which happened occasionally now that he had opportunities of meeting odette elsewhere when more and more rarely he went into society she would beg him to come to her on his way home however late he might be the season was spring the nights clear and frosty he would come away from an evening party jump into his victoria spread a rug over his knees tell the friends who were leaving at the same time and who insisted on his going home with them that he could not that he was not going in their direction then the coachman would start off at a fast trot without further orders knowing quite well where he had to go his friends would be left marvelling and as a matter of fact swann was no longer the same man no one ever received a letter from him now demanding an introduction to a woman he had ceased to pay any attention to women and kept away from the places in which they were ordinarily to be met in a restaurant or in the country his manner was deliberately and directly the opposite of that by which only a few days earlier his friends would have recognised him that manner which had seemed permanently and unalterably his own to such an extent does passion manifest itself in us as a temporary and distinct character which not only takes the place of our normal character but actually obliterates the signs by which that character has hitherto been discernible on the other hand there was one thing that was now invariable namely that wherever swann might be spending the evening he never failed to go on afterwards to odette the interval of space separating her from him was one which he must as inevitably traverse as he must descend by an irresistible gravitation the steep slope of life itself to be frank as often as not when he had stayed late at a party he would have preferred to return home at once without going so far out of his way and to postpone their meeting until the morrow but the very fact of his putting himself to such inconvenience at an abnormal hour in order to visit her while he guessed that his friends as he left them were saying to one another he is tied hand and foot there must certainly be a woman somewhere who insists on his going to her at all hours made him feel that he was leading the life of the class of men whose existence is coloured by a love affair and in whom the perpetual sacrifice which they are making of their comfort and of their practical interests has engendered a spiritual charm then though he may not consciously have taken this into consideration the certainty that she was waiting for him that she was not anywhere or with anyone else that he would see her before he went home drew the sting from that anguish forgotten it is true but latent and ever ready to be reawakened which he had felt on the evening when odette had left the verdurins' before his arrival an anguish the actual cessation of which was so agreeable that it might even be called a state of happiness perhaps it was to that hour of anguish that there must be attributed the importance which odette had since assumed in his life other people are as a rule so immaterial to us that when we have entrusted to any one of them the power to cause so much suffering or happiness to ourselves that person seems at once to belong to a different universe is surrounded with poetry makes of our lives a vast expanse quick with sensation on which that person and ourselves are ever more or less in contact swann could not without anxiety ask himself what odette would mean to him in the years that were to come sometimes as he looked up from his victoria on those fine and frosty nights of early spring and saw the dazzling moonbeams fall between his eyes and the deserted streets he would think of that other face gleaming and faintly roseate like the moon's which had one day risen on the horizon of his mind and since then had shed upon the world that mysterious light in which he saw it bathed if he arrived after the hour at which odette sent her servants to bed before ringing the bell at the gate of her little garden he would go round first into the other street over which at the ground level among the windows all exactly alike but darkened of the adjoining houses shone the solitary lighted window of her room he would rap upon the pane and she would hear the signal and answer before running to meet him at the gate he would find lying open on the piano some of her favourite music the valse des roses the pauvre fou of tagliafico which according to the instructions embodied in her will was to be played at her funeral but he would ask her instead to give him the little phrase from vinteuil's sonata it was true that odette played vilely but often the fairest impression that remains in our minds of a favourite air is one which has arisen out of a jumble of wrong notes struck by unskilful fingers upon a tuneless piano the little phrase was associated still in swann's mind with his love for odette he felt clearly that this love was something to which there were no corresponding external signs whose meaning could not be proved by any but himself he realised too that odette's qualities were not such as to justify his setting so high a value on the hours he spent in her company and often when the cold government of reason stood unchallenged he would readily have ceased to sacrifice so many of his intellectual and social interests to this imaginary pleasure but the little phrase as soon as it struck his ear had the power to liberate in him the room that was needed to contain it the proportions of swann's soul were altered a margin was left for a form of enjoyment which corresponded no more than his love for odette to any external object and yet was not like his enjoyment of that love purely individual but assumed for him an objective reality superior to that of other concrete things this thirst for an untasted charm the little phrase would stimulate it anew in him but without bringing him any definite gratification to assuage it with the result that those parts of swann's soul in which the little phrase had obliterated all care for material interests those human considerations which affect all men alike were left bare by it blank pages on which he was at liberty to inscribe the name of odette moreover where odette's affection might seem ever so little abrupt and disappointing the little phrase would come to supplement it to amalgamate with it its own mysterious essence watching swann's face while he listened to the phrase one would have said that he was inhaling an anaesthetic which allowed him to breathe more deeply and the pleasure which the music gave him which was shortly to create in him a real longing was in fact closely akin at such moments to the pleasure which he would have derived from experimenting with perfumes from entering into contract with a world for which we men were not created which appears to lack form because our eyes cannot perceive it to lack significance because it escapes our intelligence to which we may attain by way of one sense only deep repose mysterious refreshment for swann for him whose eyes although delicate interpreters of painting whose mind although an acute observer of manners must bear for ever the indelible imprint of the barrenness of his life to feel himself transformed into a creature foreign to humanity blinded deprived of his logical faculty almost a fantastic unicorn a chimaera like creature conscious of the world through his two ears alone and as notwithstanding he sought in the little phrase for a meaning to which his intelligence could not descend with what a strange frenzy of intoxication must he strip bare his innermost soul of the whole armour of reason and make it pass unattended through the straining vessel down into the dark filter of sound he began to reckon up how much that was painful perhaps even how much secret and unappeased sorrow underlay the sweetness of the phrase and yet to him it brought no suffering what matter though the phrase repeated that love is frail and fleeting when his love was so strong he played with the melancholy which the phrase diffused he felt it stealing over him but like a caress which only deepened and sweetened his sense of his own happiness he would make odette play him the phrase again ten twenty times on end insisting that while she played she must never cease to kiss him every kiss provokes another ah in those earliest days of love how naturally the kisses spring into life how closely in their abundance are they pressed one against another until lovers would find it as hard to count the kisses exchanged in an hour as to count the flowers in a meadow in may then she would pretend to stop saying how do you expect me to play when you keep on holding me i can't do everything at once make up your mind what you want am i to play the phrase or do you want to play with me then he would become annoyed and she would burst out with a laugh which was transformed as it left her lips and descended upon him in a shower of kisses or else she would look at him sulkily and he would see once again a face worthy to figure in botticelli's 'life of moses ' he would place it there giving to odette's neck the necessary inclination and when he had finished her portrait in distemper in the fifteenth century on the wall of the sixtine the idea that she was none the less in the room with him still by the piano at that very moment ready to be kissed and won the idea of her material existence of her being alive would sweep over him with so violent an intoxication that with eyes starting from his head and jaws that parted as though to devour her he would fling himself upon this botticelli maiden and kiss and bite her cheeks and then as soon as he had left the house not without returning to kiss her once again because he had forgotten to take away with him in memory some detail of her fragrance or of her features while he drove home in his victoria blessing the name of odette who allowed him to pay her these daily visits which although they could not he felt bring any great happiness to her still by keeping him immune from the fever of jealousy by removing from him every possibility of a fresh outbreak of the heart sickness which had manifested itself in him that evening when he had failed to find her at the verdurins' might help him to arrive without any recurrence of those crises of which the first had been so distressing that it must also be the last at the termination of this strange series of hours in his life hours almost enchanted in the same manner as these other following hours in which he drove through a deserted paris by the light of the moon noticing as he drove home that the satellite had now changed its position relatively to his own and was almost touching the horizon feeling that his love also was obedient to these immutable laws of nature he asked himself whether this period upon which he had entered was to last much longer whether presently his mind's eye would cease to behold that dear countenance save as occupying a distant and diminished position and on the verge of ceasing to shed on him the radiance of its charm for swann was finding in things once more since he had fallen in love the charm that he had found when in his adolescence he had fancied himself an artist with this difference that what charm lay in them now was conferred by odette alone he could feel reawakening in himself the inspirations of his boyhood which had been dissipated among the frivolities of his later life but they all bore now the reflection the stamp of a particular being and during the long hours which he now found a subtle pleasure in spending at home alone with his convalescent spirit he became gradually himself again but himself in thraldom to another he went to her only in the evenings and knew nothing of how she spent her time during the day any more than he knew of her past so little indeed that he had not even the tiny initial clue which by allowing us to imagine what we do not know stimulates a desire for knowledge and so he never asked himself what she might be doing or what her life had been only he smiled sometimes at the thought of how some years earlier when he still did not know her some one had spoken to him of a woman who if he remembered rightly must certainly have been odette as of a 'tart ' a 'kept' woman one of those women to whom he still attributed having lived but little in their company the entire set of characteristics fundamentally perverse with which they had been for many years endowed by the imagination of certain novelists he would say to himself that one has as often as not only to take the exact counterpart of the reputation created by the world in order to judge a person fairly when with such a character he contrasted that of odette so good so simple so enthusiastic in the pursuit of ideals so nearly incapable of not telling the truth that when he had once begged her so that they might dine together alone to write to mme verdurin saying that she was unwell the next day he had seen her face to face with mme verdurin who asked whether she had recovered blushing stammering and in spite of herself revealing in every feature how painful what a torture it was to her to act a lie and while in her answer she multiplied the fictitious details of an imaginary illness seeming to ask pardon by her suppliant look and her stricken accents for the obvious falsehood of her words on certain days however though these came seldom she would call upon him in the afternoon to interrupt his musings or the essay on vermeer to which he had latterly returned his servant would come in to say that mme de crécy was in the small drawing room he would go in search of her and when he opened the door on odette's blushing countenance as soon as she caught sight of swann would appear changing the curve of her lips the look in her eyes the moulding of her cheeks an all absorbing smile once he was left alone he would see again that smile and her smile of the day before another with which she had greeted him sometime else the smile which had been her answer in the carriage that night when he had asked her whether she objected to his rearranging her cattleyas and the life of odette at all other times since he knew nothing of it appeared to him upon a neutral and colourless background like those sheets of sketches by watteau upon which one sees here and there in every corner and in all directions traced in three colours upon the buff paper innumerable smiles but once in a while illuminating a chink of that existence which swann still saw as a complete blank even if his mind assured him that it was not so because he was unable to imagine anything that might occupy it some friend who knew them both and suspecting that they were in love had not dared to tell him anything about her that was of the least importance would describe odette's figure as he had seen her that very morning going on foot up the rue abbattucci in a cape trimmed with skunks wearing a rembrandt hat and a bunch of violets in her bosom this simple outline reduced swann to utter confusion by enabling him suddenly to perceive that odette had an existence which was not wholly subordinated to his own he burned to know whom she had been seeking to fascinate by this costume in which he had never seen her he registered a vow to insist upon her telling him where she had been going at that intercepted moment as though in all the colourless life a life almost nonexistent since she was then invisible to him of his mistress there had been but a single incident apart from all those smiles directed towards himself namely her walking abroad beneath a rembrandt hat with a bunch of violets in her bosom except when he asked her for vinteuil's little phrase instead of the valse des roses swann made no effort to induce her to play the things that he himself preferred nor in literature any more than in music to correct the manifold errors of her taste he fully realised that she was not intelligent when she said how much she would like him to tell her about the great poets she had imagined that she would suddenly get to know whole pages of romantic and heroic verse in the style of the vicomte de borelli only even more moving as for vermeer of delft she asked whether he had been made to suffer by a woman if it was a woman that had inspired him and once swann had told her that no one knew she had lost all interest in that painter she would often say i'm sure poetry well of course there'd be nothing like it if it was all true if the poets really believed the things they said but as often as not you'll find there's no one so mean and calculating as those fellows i know something about poetry i had a friend once who was in love with a poet of sorts in his verses he never spoke of anything but love and heaven and the stars oh she was properly taken in he had more than three hundred thousand francs out of her before he'd finished if then swann tried to shew her in what artistic beauty consisted how one ought to appreciate poetry or painting after a minute or two she would cease to listen saying yes i never thought it would be like that and he felt that her disappointment was so great that he preferred to lie to her assuring her that what he had said was nothing that he had only touched the surface that he had not time to go into it all properly that there was more in it than that then she would interrupt with a brisk more in it what do tell me but he did not tell her for he realised how petty it would appear to her and how different from what she had expected less sensational and less touching he was afraid too lest disillusioned in the matter of art she might at the same time be disillusioned in the greater matter of love with the result that she found swann inferior intellectually to what she had supposed you're always so reserved i can't make you out she marvelled increasingly at his indifference to money at his courtesy to everyone alike at the delicacy of his mind and indeed it happens often enough to a greater man than swann ever was to a scientist or artist when he is not wholly misunderstood by the people among whom he lives that the feeling in them which proves that they have been convinced of the superiority of his intellect is created not by any admiration for his ideas for those are entirely beyond them but by their respect for what they term his good qualities there was also the respect with which odette was inspired by the thought of swann's social position although she had no desire that he should attempt to secure invitations for herself perhaps she felt that such attempts would be bound to fail perhaps indeed she feared lest merely by speaking of her to his friends he should provoke disclosures of an unwelcome kind the fact remains that she had consistently held him to his promise never to mention her name her reason for not wishing to go into society was she had told him a quarrel which she had had long ago with another girl who had avenged herself by saying nasty things about her but swann objected surely people don't all know your friend yes don't you see it's like a spot of oil people are so horrid swann was unable frankly to appreciate this point on the other hand he knew that such generalisations as people are so horrid and a word of scandal spreads like a spot of oil were generally accepted as true there must therefore be cases to which they were literally applicable could odette's case be one of these he teased himself with the question though not for long for he too was subject to that mental oppression which had so weighed upon his father whenever he was faced by a difficult problem in any event that world of society which concealed such terrors for odette inspired her probably with no very great longing to enter it since it was too far removed from the world which she already knew for her to be able to form any clear conception of it at the same time while in certain respects she had retained a genuine simplicity she had for instance kept up a friendship with a little dressmaker now retired from business up whose steep and dark and fetid staircase she clambered almost every day she still thirsted to be in the fashion though her idea of it was not altogether that held by fashionable people for the latter fashion is a thing that emanates from a comparatively small number of leaders who project it to a considerable distance with more or less strength according as one is nearer to or farther from their intimate centre over the widening circle of their friends and the friends of their friends whose names form a sort of tabulated index people 'in society' know this index by heart they are gifted in such matters with an erudition from which they have extracted a sort of taste of tact so automatic in its operation that swann for example without needing to draw upon his knowledge of the world if he read in a newspaper the names of the people who had been guests at a dinner could tell at once how fashionable the dinner had been just as a man of letters merely by reading a phrase can estimate exactly the literary merit of its author but odette was one of those persons an extremely numerous class whatever the fashionable world may think and to be found in every section of society who do not share this knowledge but imagine fashion to be something of quite another kind which assumes different aspects according to the circle to which they themselves belong but has the special characteristic common alike to the fashion of which odette used to dream and to that before which mme cottard bowed of being directly accessible to all the other kind the fashion of 'fashionable people ' is it must be admitted accessible also but there are inevitable delays odette would say of some one he never goes to any place that isn't really smart and if swann were to ask her what she meant by that she would answer with a touch of contempt smart places why good heavens just fancy at your age having to be told what the smart places are in paris what do you expect me to say well on sunday mornings there's the avenue de l'impératrice and round the lake at five o'clock and on thursdays the eden théâtre and the hippodrome on fridays then there are the balls what balls why silly the balls people give in paris the smart ones i mean wait now herbinger you know who i mean the fellow who's in one of the jobbers' offices yes of course you must know him he's one of the best known men in paris that great big fair haired boy who wears such swagger clothes he always has a flower in his buttonhole and a light coloured overcoat with a fold down the back he goes about with that old image takes her to all the first nights very well he gave a ball the other night and all the smart people in paris were there i should have loved to go but you had to shew your invitation at the door and i couldn't get one anywhere after all i'm just as glad now that i didn't go i should have been killed in the crush and seen nothing still just to be able to say one had been to herbinger's ball you know how vain i am however you may be quite certain that half the people who tell you they were there are telling stories but i am surprised that you weren't there a regular 'tip topper' like you swann made no attempt however to modify this conception of fashion feeling that his own came no nearer to the truth was just as fatuous devoid of all importance he saw no advantage to be gained by imparting it to his mistress with the result that after a few months she ceased to take any interest in the people to whose houses he went except when they were the means of his obtaining tickets for the paddock at race meetings or first nights at the theatre she hoped that he would continue to cultivate such profitable acquaintances but she had come to regard them as less smart since the day when she had passed the marquise de villeparisis in the street wearing a black serge dress and a bonnet with strings but she looks like a pew opener like an old charwoman darling that a marquise goodness knows i'm not a marquise but you'd have to pay me a lot of money before you'd get me to go about paris rigged out like that nor could she understand swann's continuing to live in his house on the quai d'orléans which though she dared not tell him so she considered unworthy of him it was true that she claimed to be fond of 'antiques ' and used to assume a rapturous and knowing air when she confessed how she loved to spend the whole day 'rummaging' in second hand shops hunting for 'bric à brac ' and things of the 'right date ' although it was a point of honour to which she obstinately clung as though obeying some old family custom that she should never answer any questions never give any account of what she did during the daytime she spoke to swann once about a friend to whose house she had been invited and had found that everything in it was 'of the period ' swann could not get her to tell him what 'period' it was only after thinking the matter over she replied that it was 'mediaeval' by which she meant that the walls were panelled some time later she spoke to him again of her friend and added in the hesitating but confident tone in which one refers to a person whom one has met somewhere at dinner the night before of whom one had never heard until then but whom one's hosts seemed to regard as some one so celebrated and important that one hopes that one's listener will know quite well who is meant and will be duly impressed her dining room is eighteenth century incidentally she had thought it hideous all bare as though the house were still unfinished women looked frightful in it and it would never become the fashion she mentioned it again a third time when she shewed swann a card with the name and address of the man who had designed the dining room and whom she wanted to send for when she had enough money to see whether he could not do one for her too not one like that of course but one of the sort she used to dream of one which unfortunately her little house would not be large enough to contain with tall sideboards renaissance furniture and fireplaces like the château at blois it was on this occasion that she let out to swann what she really thought of his abode on the quai d'orléans he having ventured the criticism that her friend had indulged not in the louis xvi style for he went on although that was not of course done still it might be made charming but in the 'sham antique ' you wouldn't have her live like you among a lot of broken down chairs and threadbare carpets she exclaimed the innate respectability of the middle class housewife rising impulsively to the surface through the acquired dilettantism of the 'light woman ' people who enjoyed 'picking up' things who admired poetry despised sordid calculations of profit and loss and nourished ideals of honour and love she placed in a class by themselves superior to the rest of humanity there was no need actually to have those tastes provided one talked enough about them when a man had told her at dinner that he loved to wander about and get his hands all covered with dust in the old furniture shops that he would never be really appreciated in this commercial age since he was not concerned about the things that interested it and that he belonged to another generation altogether she would come home saying why he's an adorable creature so sensitive i had no idea and she would conceive for him a strong and sudden friendship but on the other hand men who like swann had these tastes but did not speak of them left her cold she was obliged of course to admit that swann was most generous with his money but she would add pouting it's not the same thing you see with him and as a matter of fact what appealed to her imagination was not the practice of disinterestedness but its vocabulary feeling that often he could not give her in reality the pleasures of which she dreamed he tried at least to ensure that she should be happy in his company tried not to contradict those vulgar ideas that bad taste which she displayed on every possible occasion which all the same he loved as he could not help loving everything that came from her which even fascinated him for were they not so many more of those characteristic features by virtue of which the essential qualities of the woman emerged and were made visible and so when she was in a happy mood because she was going to see the reine topaze or when her eyes grew serious troubled petulant if she was afraid of missing the flower show or merely of not being in time for tea with muffins and toast at the rue royale tea rooms where she believed that regular attendance was indispensable and set the seal upon a woman's certificate of 'smartness ' swann enraptured as all of us are at times by the natural behaviour of a child or by the likeness of a portrait which appears to be on the point of speaking would feel so distinctly the soul of his mistress rising to fill the outlines of her face that he could not refrain from going across and welcoming it with his lips oh then so little odette wants us to take her to the flower show does she she wants to be admired does she very well we will take her there we can but obey her wishes as swann's sight was beginning to fail he had to resign himself to a pair of spectacles which he wore at home when working while to face the world he adopted a single eyeglass as being less disfiguring the first time that she saw it in his eye she could not contain herself for joy i really do think for a man that is to say it is tremendously smart how nice you look with it every inch a gentleman all you want now is a title she concluded with a tinge of regret in her voice he liked odette to say these things just as if he had been in love with a breton girl he would have enjoyed seeing her in her coif and hearing her say that she believed in ghosts always until then as is common among men whose taste for the fine arts develops independently of their sensuality a grotesque disparity had existed between the satisfactions which he would accord to either taste simultaneously yielding to the seduction of works of art which grew more and more subtle as the women in whose company he enjoyed them grew more illiterate and common he would take a little servant girl to a screened box in a theatre where there was some decadent piece which he had wished to see performed or to an exhibition of impressionist painting with the conviction moreover that an educated 'society' woman would have understood them no better but would not have managed to keep quiet about them so prettily but now that he was in love with odette all this was changed to share her sympathies to strive to be one with her in spirit was a task so attractive that he tried to find satisfaction in the things that she liked and did find a pleasure not only in copying her habits but in adopting her opinions which was all the deeper because as those habits and opinions sprang from no roots in her intelligence they suggested to him nothing except that love for the sake of which he had preferred them to his own if he went again to serge panine if he looked out for opportunities of going to watch olivier métra conducting it was for the pleasure of being initiated into every one of the ideas in odette's mind of feeling that he had an equal share in all her tastes this charm of drawing him closer to her which her favourite plays and pictures and places possessed struck him as being more mysterious than the intrinsic charm of more beautiful things and places which appealed to him by their beauty but without recalling her besides having allowed the intellectual beliefs of his youth to grow faint until his scepticism as a finished 'man of the world ' had gradually penetrated them unawares he held or at least he had held for so long that he had fallen into the habit of saying that the objects which we admire have no absolute value in themselves that the whole thing is a matter of dates and castes and consists in a series of fashions the most vulgar of which are worth just as much as those which are regarded as the most refined and as he had decided that the importance which odette attached to receiving cards tot a private view was not in itself any more ridiculous than the pleasure which he himself had at one time felt in going to luncheon with the prince of wales so he did not think that the admiration which she professed for monte carlo or for the righi was any more unreasonable than his own liking for holland which she imagined as ugly and for versailles which bored her to tears and so he denied himself the pleasure of visiting those places consoling himself with the reflection that it was for her sake that he wished to feel to like nothing that was not equally felt and liked by her like everything else that formed part of odette's environment and was no more in a sense than the means whereby he might see and talk to her more often he enjoyed the society of the verdurins with them since at the heart of all their entertainments dinners musical evenings games suppers in fancy dress excursions to the country theatre parties even the infrequent 'big evenings' when they entertained 'bores ' there were the presence of odette the sight of odette conversation with odette an inestimable boon which the verdurins by inviting him to their house bestowed on swann he was happier in the little 'nucleus' than anywhere else and tried to find some genuine merit in each of its members imagining that his tastes would lead him to frequent their society for the rest of his life never daring to whisper to himself lest he should doubt the truth of the suggestion that he would always be in love with odette at least when he tried to suppose that he would always go to the verdurins' a proposition which a priori raised fewer fundamental objections on the part of his intelligence he saw himself for the future continuing to meet odette every evening that did not perhaps come quite to the same thing as his being permanently in love with her but for the moment while he was in love with her to feel that he would not one day cease to see her was all that he could ask what a charming atmosphere he said to himself how entirely genuine life is to these people they are far more intelligent far more artistic surely than the people one knows mme verdurin in spite of a few trifling exaggerations which are rather absurd has a sincere love of painting and music what a passion for works of art what anxiety to give pleasure to artists her ideas about some of the people one knows are not quite right but then their ideas about artistic circles are altogether wrong possibly i make no great intellectual demands upon conversation but i am perfectly happy talking to cottard although he does trot out those idiotic puns and as for the painter if he is rather unpleasantly affected when he tries to be paradoxical still he has one of the finest brains that i have ever come across besides what is most important one feels quite free there one does what one likes without constraint or fuss what a flow of humour there is every day in that drawing room certainly with a few rare exceptions i never want to go anywhere else again it will become more and more of a habit and i shall spend the rest of my life among them and as the qualities which he supposed to be an intrinsic part of the verdurin character were no more really than their superficial reflection of the pleasure which had been enjoyed in their society by his love for odette those qualities became more serious more profound more vital as that pleasure increased since mme verdurin gave swann now and then what alone could constitute his happiness since on an evening when he felt anxious because odette had talked rather more to one of the party than to another and in a spasm of irritation would not take the initiative by asking her whether she was coming home mme verdurin brought peace and joy to his troubled spirit by the spontaneous exclamation odette you'll see m swann home won't you since when the summer holidays came and after he had asked himself uneasily whether odette might not leave paris without him whether he would still be able to see her every day mme verdurin was going to invite them both to spend the summer with her in the country swann unconsciously allowing gratitude and self interest to filter into his intelligence and to influence his ideas went so far as to proclaim that mme verdurin was a great and noble soul should any of his old fellow pupils in the louvre school of painting speak to him of some rare or eminent artist i'd a hundred times rather he would reply have the verdurins and with a solemnity of diction which was new in him they are magnanimous creatures and magnanimity is after all the one thing that matters the one thing that gives us distinction here on earth look you there are only two classes of men the magnanimous and the rest and i have reached an age when one has to take sides to decide once and for all whom one is going to like and dislike to stick to the people one likes and to make up for the time one has wasted with the others never to leave them again as long as one lives very well he went on with the slight emotion which a man feels when even without being fully aware of what he is doing he says something not because it is true but because he enjoys saying it and listens to his own voice uttering the words as though they came from some one else the die is now cast i have elected to love none but magnanimous souls and to live only in an atmosphere of magnanimity you ask me whether mme verdurin is really intelligent i can assure you that she has given me proofs of a nobility of heart of a loftiness of soul to which no one could possibly attain how could they without a corresponding loftiness of mind without question she has a profound understanding of art but it is not perhaps in that that she is most admirable every little action ingeniously exquisitely kind which she has performed for my sake every friendly attention simple little things quite domestic and yet quite sublime reveal a more profound comprehension of existence than all your textbooks of philosophy he might have reminded himself all the same that there were various old friends of his family who were just as simple as the verdurins companions of his early days who were just as fond of art that he knew other 'great hearted creatures ' and that nevertheless since he had cast his vote in favour of simplicity the arts and magnanimity he had entirely ceased to see them but these people did not know odette and if they had known her would never have thought of introducing her to him and so there was probably not in the whole of the verdurin circle a single one of the 'faithful' who loved them or believed that he loved them as dearly as did swann and yet when m verdurin said that he was not satisfied with swann he had not only expressed his own sentiments he had unwittingly discovered his wife's doubtless swann had too particular an affection for odette as to which he had failed to take mme verdurin daily into his confidence doubtless the very discretion with which he availed himself of the verdurins' hospitality refraining often from coming to dine with them for a reason which they never suspected and in place of which they saw only an anxiety on his part not to have to decline an invitation to the house of some 'bore' or other doubtless also and despite all the precautions which he had taken to keep it from them the gradual discovery which they were making of his brilliant position in society doubtless all these things contributed to their general annoyance with swann but the real the fundamental reason was quite different what had happened was that they had at once discovered in him a locked door a reserved impenetrable chamber in which he still professed silently to himself that the princesse de sagan was not grotesque and that cottard's jokes were not amusing in a word and for all that he never once abandoned his friendly attitude towards them all or revolted from their dogmas they had discovered an impossibility of imposing those dogmas upon him of entirely converting him to their faith the like of which they had never come across in anyone before they would have forgiven his going to the houses of 'bores' to whom as it happened in his heart of hearts he infinitely preferred the verdurins and all their little 'nucleus' had he consented to set a good example by openly renouncing those 'bores' in the presence of the 'faithful ' but that was an abjuration which as they well knew they were powerless to extort what a difference was there in a 'newcomer' whom odette had asked them to invite although she herself had met him only a few times and on whom they were building great hopes the comte de forcheville it turned out that he was nothing more nor less than the brother in law of saniette a discovery which filled all the 'faithful' with amazement the manners of the old palaeographer were so humble that they had always supposed him to be of a class inferior socially to their own and had never expected to learn that he came of a rich and relatively aristocratic family of course forcheville was enormously the 'swell ' which swann was not or had quite ceased to be of course he would never dream of placing as swann now placed the verdurin circle above any other but he lacked that natural refinement which prevented swann from associating himself with the criticisms too obviously false to be worth his notice that mme verdurin levelled at people whom he knew as for the vulgar and affected tirades in which the painter sometimes indulged the bag man's pleasantries which cottard used to hazard whereas swann who liked both men sincerely could easily find excuses for these without having either the courage or the hypocrisy to applaud them forcheville on the other hand was on an intellectual level which permitted him to be stupified amazed by the invective without in the least understanding what it all was about and to be frankly delighted by the wit and the very first dinner at the verdurins' at which forcheville was present threw a glaring light upon all the differences between them made his qualities start into prominence and precipitated the disgrace of swann there was at this dinner besides the usual party a professor from the sorbonne one brichot who had met m and mme verdurin at a watering place somewhere and if his duties at the university and his other works of scholarship had not left him with very little time to spare would gladly have come to them more often for he had that curiosity that superstitious outlook on life which combined with a certain amount of scepticism with regard to the object of their studies earn for men of intelligence whatever their profession for doctors who do not believe in medicine for schoolmasters who do not believe in latin exercises the reputation of having broad brilliant and indeed superior minds he affected when at mme verdurin's to choose his illustrations from among the most topical subjects of the day when he spoke of philosophy or history principally because he regarded those sciences as no more really than a preparation for life itself and imagined that he was seeing put into practice by the 'little clan' what hitherto he had known only from books and also perhaps because having had drilled into him as a boy and having unconsciously preserved a feeling of reverence for certain subjects he thought that he was casting aside the scholar's gown when he ventured to treat those subjects with a conversational licence which seemed so to him only because the folds of the gown still clung early in the course of the dinner when m de forcheville seated on the right of mme verdurin who in the 'newcomer's' honour had taken great pains with her toilet observed to her quite original that white dress the doctor who had never taken his eyes off him so curious was he to learn the nature and attributes of what he called a de and was on the look out for an opportunity of attracting his attention so as to come into closer contact with him caught in its flight the adjective ' blanche ' and his eyes still glued to his plate snapped out blanche blanche of castile then without moving his head shot a furtive glance to right and left of him doubtful but happy on the whole while swann by the painful and futile effort which he made to smile testified that he thought the pun absurd forcheville had shewn at once that he could appreciate its subtlety and that he was a man of the world by keeping within its proper limits a mirth the spontaneity of which had charmed mme verdurin what are you to say of a scientist like that she asked forcheville you can't talk seriously to him for two minutes on end is that the sort of thing you tell them at your hospital she went on turning to the doctor they must have some pretty lively times there if that's the case i can see that i shall have to get taken in as a patient i think i heard the doctor speak of that wicked old humbug blanche of castile if i may so express myself am i not right madame brichot appealed to mme verdurin who swooning with merriment her eyes tightly closed had buried her face in her two hands from between which now and then escaped a muffled scream good gracious madame i would not dream of shocking the reverent minded if there are any such around this table sub rosa i recognise moreover that our ineffable and athenian oh how infinitely athenian republic is capable of honouring in the person of that obscurantist old she capet the first of our chiefs of police yes indeed my dear host yes indeed he repeated in his ringing voice which sounded a separate note for each syllable in reply to a protest by m verdurin the chronicle of saint denis and the authenticity of its information is beyond question leaves us no room for doubt on that point no one could be more fitly chosen as patron by a secularising proletariat than that mother of a saint who let him see some pretty fishy saints besides as suger says and other great st bernards of the sort for with her it was a case of taking just what you pleased who is that gentleman forcheville asked mme verdurin he seems to speak with great authority what do you mean to say you don't know the famous brichot why he's celebrated all over europe oh that's bréchot is it exclaimed forcheville who had not quite caught the name you must tell me all about him he went on fastening a pair of goggle eyes on the celebrity it's always interesting to meet well known people at dinner but i say you ask us to very select parties here no dull evenings in this house i'm sure well you know what it is really said mme verdurin modestly they feel safe here they can talk about whatever they like and the conversation goes off like fireworks now brichot this evening is nothing i've seen him don't you know when he's been with me simply dazzling you'd want to go on your knees to him well with anyone else he's not the same man he's not in the least witty you have to drag the words out of him he's even boring that's strange remarked forcheville with fitting astonishment a sort of wit like brichot's would have been regarded as out and out stupidity by the people among whom swann had spent his early life for all that it is quite compatible with real intelligence and the intelligence of the professor's vigorous and well nourished brain might easily have been envied by many of the people in society who seemed witty enough to swann but these last had so thoroughly inculcated into him their likes and dislikes at least in everything that pertained to their ordinary social existence including that annex to social existence which belongs strictly speaking to the domain of intelligence namely conversation that swann could not see anything in brichot's pleasantries to him they were merely pedantic vulgar and disgustingly coarse he was shocked too being accustomed to good manners by the rude almost barrack room tone which this student in arms adopted no matter to whom he was speaking finally perhaps he had lost all patience that evening as he watched mme verdurin welcoming with such unnecessary warmth this forcheville fellow whom it had been odette's unaccountable idea to bring to the house feeling a little awkward with swann there also she had asked him on her arrival what do you think of my guest and he suddenly realising for the first time that forcheville whom he had known for years could actually attract a woman and was quite a good specimen of a man had retorted beastly he had certainly no idea of being jealous of odette but did not feel quite so happy as usual and when brichot having begun to tell them the story of blanche of castile's mother who according to him had been with henry plantagenet for years before they were married tried to prompt swann to beg him to continue the story by interjecting isn't that so m swann in the martial accents which one uses in order to get down to the level of an unintelligent rustic or to put the 'fear of god' into a trooper swann cut his story short to the intense fury of their hostess by begging to be excused for taking so little interest in blanche of castile as he had something that he wished to ask the painter he it appeared had been that afternoon to an exhibition of the work of another artist also a friend of mme verdurin who had recently died and swann wished to find out from him for he valued his discrimination whether there had really been anything more in this later work than the virtuosity which had struck people so forcibly in his earlier exhibitions from that point of view it was extraordinary but it did not seem to me to be a form of art which you could call 'elevated ' said swann with a smile elevated to the height of an institute interrupted cottard raising his arms with mock solemnity the whole table burst out laughing what did i tell you said mme verdurin to forcheville it's simply impossible to be serious with him when you least expect it out he comes with a joke but she observed that swann and swann alone had not unbent for one thing he was none too well pleased with cottard for having secured a laugh at his expense in front of forcheville but the painter instead of replying in a way that might have interested swann as he would probably have done had they been alone together preferred to win the easy admiration of the rest by exercising his wit upon the talent of their dead friend i went up to one of them he began just to see how it was done i stuck my nose into it yes i don't think impossible to say whether it was done with glue with soap with sealing wax with sunshine with leaven with excrem and one make twelve shouted the doctor wittily but just too late for no one saw the point of his interruption it looks as though it were done with nothing at all resumed the painter no more chance of discovering the trick than there is in the 'night watch ' or the 'regents ' and it's even bigger work than either rembrandt or hals ever did it's all there and yet no i'll take my oath it isn't then just as singers who have reached the highest note in their compass proceed to hum the rest of the air in falsetto he had to be satisfied with murmuring smiling the while as if after all there had been something irresistibly amusing in the sheer beauty of the painting it smells all right it makes your head go round it catches your breath you feel ticklish all over and not the faintest clue to how it's done the man's a sorcerer the thing's a conjuring trick it's a miracle bursting outright into laughter it's dishonest then stopping solemnly raising his head pitching his voice on a double bass note which he struggled to bring into harmony he concluded and it's so loyal except at the moment when he had called it bigger than the 'night watch ' a blasphemy which had called forth an instant protest from mme verdurin who regarded the 'night watch' as the supreme masterpiece of the universe conjointly with the 'ninth' and the 'samothrace' and at the word excrement which had made forcheville throw a sweeping glance round the table to see whether it was 'all right ' before he allowed his lips to curve in a prudish and conciliatory smile all the party save swann had kept their fascinated and adoring eyes fixed upon the painter i do so love him when he goes up in the air like that cried mme verdurin the moment that he had finished enraptured that the table talk should have proved so entertaining on the very night that forcheville was dining with them for the first time hallo you she turned to her husband what's the matter with you sitting there gaping like a great animal you know though don't you she apologised for him to the painter that he can talk quite well when he chooses anybody would think it was the first time he had ever listened to you if you had only seen him while you were speaking he was just drinking it all in and to morrow he will tell us everything you said without missing a word no really i'm not joking protested the painter enchanted by the success of his speech you all look as if you thought i was pulling your legs that it was just a trick i'll take you to see the show and then you can say whether i've been exaggerating i'll bet you anything you like you'll come away more 'up in the air' than i am but we don't suppose for a moment that you're exaggerating we only want you to go on with your dinner and my husband too give m biche some more sole can't you see his has got cold we're not in any hurry you're dashing round as if the house was on fire wait a little don't serve the salad just yet mme cottard who was a shy woman and spoke but seldom was not lacking for all that in self assurance when a happy inspiration put the right word in her mouth she felt that it would be well received the thought gave her confidence and what she was doing was done with the object not so much of shining herself as of helping her husband on in his career and so she did not allow the word 'salad ' which mme verdurin had just uttered to pass unchallenged it's not a japanese salad is it she whispered turning towards odette and then in her joy and confusion at the combination of neatness and daring which there had been in making so discreet and yet so unmistakable an allusion to the new and brilliantly successful play by dumas she broke down in a charming girlish laugh not very loud but so irresistible that it was some time before she could control it who is that lady she seems devilish clever said forcheville no it is not but we will have one for you if you will all come to dinner on friday you will think me dreadfully provincial sir said mme cottard to swann but do you know i haven't been yet to this famous francillon that everybody's talking about the doctor has been i remember now he told me what a very great pleasure it had been to him to spend the evening with you there and i must confess i don't see much sense in spending money on seats for him to take me when he's seen the play already of course an evening at the théâtre français is never wasted really the acting's so good there always but we have some very nice friends mme cottard would hardly ever utter a proper name but restricted herself to some friends of ours or one of my friends as being more 'distinguished ' speaking in an affected tone and with all the importance of a person who need give names only when she chooses who often have a box and are kind enough to take us to all the new pieces that are worth going to and so i'm certain to see this francillon sooner or later and then i shall know what to think but i do feel such a fool about it i must confess for whenever i pay a call anywhere i find everybody talking it's only natural about that wretched japanese salad really and truly one's beginning to get just a little tired of hearing about it she went on seeing that swann seemed less interested than she had hoped in so burning a topic i must admit though that it's sometimes quite amusing the way they joke about it i've got a friend now who is most original though she's really a beautiful woman most popular in society goes everywhere and she tells me that she got her cook to make one of these japanese salads putting in everything that young m dumas says you're to put in in the play then she asked just a few friends to come and taste it i was not among the favoured few i'm sorry to say but she told us all about it on her next 'day' it seems it was quite horrible she made us all laugh till we cried i don't know perhaps it was the way she told it mme cottard added doubtfully seeing that swann still looked grave and imagining that it was perhaps because he had not been amused by francillon well i daresay i shall be disappointed with it after all i don't suppose it's as good as the piece mme de crécy worships serge panine there's a play if you like so deep makes you think but just fancy giving a receipt for a salad on the stage of the théâtre français now serge panine but then it's like everything that comes from the pen of m georges ohnet it's so well written i wonder if you know the maître des forges which i like even better than serge panine pardon me said swann with polite irony but i can assure you that my want of admiration is almost equally divided between those masterpieces really now that's very interesting and what don't you like about them won't you ever change your mind perhaps you think he's a little too sad well well what i always say is one should never argue about plays or novels everyone has his own way of looking at things and what may be horrible to you is perhaps just what i like best she was interrupted by forcheville's addressing swann what had happened was that while mme cottard was discussing francillon forcheville had been expressing to mme verdurin his admiration for what he called the little speech of the painter your friend has such a flow of language such a memory he had said to her when the painter had come to a standstill i've seldom seen anything like it he'd make a first rate preacher by jove i wish i was like that what with him and m bréchot you've drawn two lucky numbers to night though i'm not so sure that simply as a speaker this one doesn't knock spots off the professor it comes more naturally with him less like reading from a book of course the way he goes on he does use some words that are a bit realistic and all that but that's quite the thing nowadays anyhow it's not often i've seen a man hold the floor as cleverly as that 'hold the spittoon ' as we used to say in the regiment where by the way we had a man he rather reminds me of you could take anything you liked i don't know what this glass say and he'd talk away about it for hours no not this glass that's a silly thing to say i'm sorry but something a little bigger like the battle of waterloo or anything of that sort he'd tell you things you simply wouldn't believe why swann was in the regiment then he must have known him do you see much of m swann asked mme verdurin oh dear no he answered and then thinking that if he made himself pleasant to swann he might find favour with odette he decided to take this opportunity of flattering him by speaking of his fashionable friends but speaking as a man of the world himself in a tone of good natured criticism and not as though he were congratulating swann upon some undeserved good fortune isn't that so swann i never see anything of you do i but then where on earth is one to see him the creature spends all his time shut up with the la trémoïlles with the laumes and all that lot the imputation would have been false at any time and was all the more so now that for at least a year swann had given up going to almost any house but the verdurins' but the mere names of families whom the verdurins did not know were received by them in a reproachful silence m verdurin dreading the painful impression which the mention of these 'bores ' especially when flung at her in this tactless fashion and in front of all the 'faithful ' was bound to make on his wife cast a covert glance at her instinct with anxious solicitude he saw then that in her fixed resolution to take no notice to have escaped contact altogether with the news which had just been addressed to her not merely to remain dumb but to have been deaf as well as we pretend to be when a friend who has been in the wrong attempts to slip into his conversation some excuse which we should appear to be accepting should we appear to have heard it without protesting or when some one utters the name of an enemy the very mention of whom in our presence is forbidden mme verdurin so that her silence should have the appearance not of consent but of the unconscious silence which inanimate objects preserve had suddenly emptied her face of all life of all mobility her rounded forehead was nothing now but an exquisite study in high relief which the name of those la trémoïlles with whom swann was always 'shut up ' had failed to penetrate her nose just perceptibly wrinkled in a frown exposed to view two dark cavities that were surely modelled from life you would have said that her half opened lips were just about to speak it was all no more however than a wax cast a mask in plaster the sculptor's design for a monument a bust to be exhibited in the palace of industry where the public would most certainly gather in front of it and marvel to see how the sculptor in expressing the unchallengeable dignity of the verdurins as opposed to that of the la trémoïlles or laumes whose equals if not indeed their betters they were and the equals and betters of all other 'bores' upon the face of the earth had managed to invest with a majesty that was almost papal the whiteness and rigidity of his stone but the marble at last grew animated and let it be understood that it didn't do to be at all squeamish if one went to that house since the woman was always tipsy and the husband so uneducated that he called a corridor a 'collidor' you'd need to pay me a lot of money before i'd let any of that lot set foot inside my house mme verdurin concluded gazing imperially down on swann she could scarcely have expected him to capitulate so completely as to echo the holy simplicity of the pianist's aunt who at once exclaimed to think of that now what surprises me is that they can get anybody to go near them i'm sure i should be afraid one can't be too careful how can people be so common as to go running after them but he might at least have replied like forcheville gad she's a duchess there are still plenty of people who are impressed by that sort of thing which would at least have permitted mme verdurin the final retort and a lot of good may it do them instead of which swann merely smiled in a manner which shewed quite clearly that he could not of course take such an absurd suggestion seriously m verdurin who was still casting furtive and intermittent glances at his wife could see with regret and could understand only too well that she was now inflamed with the passion of a grand inquisitor who cannot succeed in stamping out a heresy and so in the hope of bringing swann round to a retractation for the courage of one's opinions is always a form of calculating cowardice in the eyes of the 'other side' he broke in tell us frankly now what you think of them yourself we shan't repeat it to them you may be sure to which swann answered why i'm not in the least afraid of the duchess if it is of the la trémoïlles that you're speaking i can assure you that everyone likes going to see her i don't go so far as to say that she's at all 'deep' he pronounced the word as if it meant something ridiculous for his speech kept the traces of certain mental habits which the recent change in his life a rejuvenation illustrated by his passion for music had inclined him temporarily to discard so that at times he would actually state his views with considerable warmth but i am quite sincere when i say that she is intelligent while her husband is positively a bookworm they are charming people his explanation was terribly effective mme verdurin now realised that this one state of unbelief would prevent her 'little nucleus' from ever attaining to complete unanimity and was unable to restrain herself in her fury at the obstinacy of this wretch who could not see what anguish his words were causing her but cried aloud from the depths of her tortured heart you may think so if you wish but at least you need not say so to us it all depends upon what you call intelligence forcheville felt that it was his turn to be brilliant come now swann tell us what you mean by intelligence there cried odette that's one of the big things i beg him to tell me about and he never will oh but protested swann oh but nonsense said odette a water butt asked the doctor to you pursued forcheville does intelligence mean what they call clever talk you know the sort of people who worm their way into society finish your sweet so that they can take your plate away said mme verdurin sourly to saniette who was lost in thought and had stopped eating and then perhaps a little ashamed of her rudeness it doesn't matter take your time about it there's no hurry i only reminded you because of the others you know it keeps the servants back there is began brichot with a resonant smack upon every syllable a rather curious definition of intelligence by that pleasing old anarchist fénelon just listen to this mme verdurin rallied forcheville and the doctor he's going to give us fénelon's definition of intelligence that's interesting it's not often you get a chance of hearing that but brichot was keeping fénelon's definition until swann should have given his own swann remained silent and by this fresh act of recreancy spoiled the brilliant tournament of dialectic which mme verdurin was rejoicing at being able to offer to forcheville you see it's just the same as with me odette was peevish i'm not at all sorry to see that i'm not the only one he doesn't find quite up to his level these de la trémouailles whom mme verdurin has exhibited to us as so little to be desired inquired brichot articulating vigorously are they by any chance descended from the couple whom that worthy old snob sévigné said she was delighted to know because it was so good for her peasants true the marquise had another reason which in her case probably came first for she was a thorough journalist at heart and always on the look out for 'copy ' and in the journal which she used to send regularly to her daughter it was mme de la trémouaille kept well informed through all her grand connections who supplied the foreign politics oh dear no i'm quite sure they aren't the same family said mme verdurin desperately saniette who ever since he had surrendered his untouched plate to the butler had been plunged once more in silent meditation emerged finally to tell them with a nervous laugh a story of how he had once dined with the duc de la trémoïlle the point of which was that the duke did not know that george sand was the pseudonym of a woman swann who really liked saniette felt bound to supply him with a few facts illustrative of the duke's culture which would prove that such ignorance on his part was literally impossible but suddenly he stopped short he had realised as he was speaking that saniette needed no proof but knew already that the story was untrue for the simple reason that he had at that moment invented it the worthy man suffered acutely from the verdurins' always finding him so dull and as he was conscious of having been more than ordinarily morose this evening he had made up his mind that he would succeed in being amusing at least once before the end of dinner he surrendered so quickly looked so wretched at the sight of his castle in ruins and replied in so craven a tone to swann appealing to him not to persist in a refutation which was already superfluous all right all right anyhow even if i have made a mistake that's not a crime i hope that swann longed to be able to console him by insisting that the story was indubitably true and exquisitely funny the doctor who had been listening had an idea that it was the right moment to interject se non è vero but he was not quite certain of the words and was afraid of being caught out after dinner forcheville went up to the doctor she can't have been at all bad looking mme verdurin anyhow she's a woman you can really talk to that's all i want of course she's getting a bit broad in the beam but mme de crécy there's a little woman who knows what's what all right upon my word and soul you can see at a glance she's got the american eye that girl has we are speaking of mme de crécy he explained as m verdurin joined them his pipe in his mouth i should say that as a specimen of the female form i'd rather have it in my bed than a clap of thunder the words came tumbling from cottard who had for some time been waiting in vain until forcheville should pause for breath so that he might get in his hoary old joke a chance for which might not he feared come again if the conversation should take a different turn and he produced it now with that excessive spontaneity and confidence which may often be noticed attempting to cover up the coldness and the slight flutter of emotion inseparable from a prepared recitation forcheville knew and saw the joke and was thoroughly amused as for m verdurin he was unsparing of his merriment having recently discovered a way of expressing it by a symbol different from his wife's but equally simple and obvious scarcely had he begun the movement of head and shoulders of a man who was 'shaking with laughter' than he would begin also to cough as though in laughing too violently he had swallowed a mouthful of smoke from his pipe and by keeping the pipe firmly in his mouth he could prolong indefinitely the dumb show of suffocation and hilarity so he and mme verdurin who at the other side of the room where the painter was telling her a story was shutting her eyes preparatory to flinging her face into her hands resembled two masks in a theatre each representing comedy but in a different way m verdurin had been wiser than he knew in not taking his pipe out of his mouth for cottard having occasion to leave the room for a moment murmured a witty euphemism which he had recently acquired and repeated now whenever he had to go to the place in question i must just go and see the duc d'aumale for a minute so drolly that m verdurin's cough began all over again now then take your pipe out of your mouth can't you see you'll choke if you try to bottle up your laughter like that counselled mme verdurin as she came round with a tray of liqueurs what a delightful man your husband is he has the wit of a dozen declared forcheville to mme cottard thank you thank you an old soldier like me can never say 'no' to a drink m de forcheville thinks odette charming m verdurin told his wife why do you know she wants so much to meet you again some day at luncheon we must arrange it but don't on any account let swann hear about it he spoils everything don't you know i don't mean to say that you're not to come to dinner too of course we hope to see you very often now that the warm weather's coming we're going to have dinner out of doors whenever we can that won't bore you will it a quiet little dinner now and then in the bois splendid splendid that will be quite delightful aren't you going to do any work this evening i say she screamed suddenly to the little pianist seeing an opportunity for displaying before a 'newcomer' of forcheville's importance at once her unfailing wit and her despotic power over the 'faithful ' m de forcheville was just going to say something dreadful about you mme cottard warned her husband as he reappeared in the room and he still following up the idea of forcheville's noble birth which had obsessed him all through dinner began again with i am treating a baroness just now baroness putbus weren't there some putbuses in the crusades anyhow they've got a lake in pomerania that's ten times the size of the place de la concorde i am treating her for dry arthritis she's a charming woman mme verdurin knows her too i believe which enabled forcheville a moment later finding himself alone with mme cottard to complete his favourable verdict on her husband with he's an interesting man too you can see that he knows some good people gad but they get to know a lot of things those doctors d'you want me to play the phrase from the sonata for m swann asked the pianist what the devil's that not the sonata snake i hope shouted m de forcheville hoping to create an effect but dr cottard who had never heard this pun missed the point of it and imagined that m de forcheville had made a mistake he dashed in boldly to correct it no no the word isn't serpent à sonates it's serpent à sonnettes he explained in a tone at once zealous impatient and triumphant forcheville explained the joke to him the doctor blushed you'll admit it's not bad eh doctor oh i've known it for ages then they were silenced heralded by the waving tremolo of the violin part which formed a bristling bodyguard of sound two octaves above it and as in a mountainous country against the seeming immobility of a vertically falling torrent one may distinguish two hundred feet below the tiny form of a woman walking in the valley the little phrase had just appeared distant but graceful protected by the long gradual unfurling of its transparent incessant and sonorous curtain and swann in his heart of hearts turned to it spoke to it as to a confidant in the secret of his love as to a friend of odette who would assure him that he need pay no attention to this forcheville ah you've come too late mme verdurin greeted one of the 'faithful ' whose invitation had been only 'to look in after dinner ' we've been having a simply incomparable brichot you never heard such eloquence but he's gone isn't that so m swann i believe it's the first time you've met him she went on to emphasize the fact that it was to her that swann owed the introduction isn't that so wasn't he delicious our brichot swann bowed politely no you weren't interested she asked dryly oh but i assure you i was quite enthralled he is perhaps a little too peremptory a little too jovial for my taste i should like to see him a little less confident at times a little more tolerant but one feels that he knows a great deal and on the whole he seems a very sound fellow the party broke up very late cottard's first words to his wife were i have rarely seen mme verdurin in such form as she was to night what exactly is your mme verdurin a bit of a bad hat eh said forcheville to the painter to whom he had offered a 'lift ' odette watched his departure with regret she dared not refuse to let swann take her home but she was moody and irritable in the carriage and when he asked whether he might come in replied i suppose so with an impatient shrug of her shoulders when they had all gone mme verdurin said to her husband did you notice the way swann laughed such an idiotic laugh when we spoke about mme la trémoïlle she had remarked more than once how swann and forcheville suppressed the particle 'de' before that lady's name never doubting that it was done on purpose to shew that they were not afraid of a title she had made up her mind to imitate their arrogance but had not quite grasped what grammatical form it ought to take moreover the natural corruptness of her speech overcoming her implacable republicanism she still said instinctively the de la trémoïlles or rather by an abbreviation sanctified by the usage of music hall singers and the writers of the 'captions' beneath caricatures who elide the 'de' the d'la trémoïlles but she corrected herself at once to madame la trémoïlle the duchess as swann calls her she added ironically with a smile which proved that she was merely quoting and would not herself accept the least responsibility for a classification so puerile and absurd i don't mind saying that i thought him extremely stupid m verdurin took it up he's not sincere he's a crafty customer always hovering between one side and the other he's always trying to run with the hare and hunt with the hounds what a difference between him and forcheville there at least you have a man who tells you straight out what he thinks either you agree with him or you don't not like the other fellow who's never definitely fish or fowl did you notice by the way that odette seemed all out for forcheville and i don't blame her either and then after all if swann tries to come the man of fashion over us the champion of distressed duchesses at any rate the other man has got a title he's always comte de forcheville he let the words slip delicately from his lips as though familiar with every page of the history of that dignity he were making a scrupulously exact estimate of its value in relation to others of the sort i don't mind saying mme verdurin went on that he saw fit to utter some most venomous and quite absurd insinuations against brichot naturally once he saw that brichot was popular in this house it was a way of hitting back at us of spoiling our party i know his sort the dear good friend of the family who pulls you all to pieces on the stairs as he's going away didn't i say so retorted her husband he's simply a failure a poor little wretch who goes through life mad with jealousy of anything that's at all big had the truth been known there was not one of the 'faithful' who was not infinitely more malicious than swann but the others would all take the precaution of tempering their malice with obvious pleasantries with little sparks of emotion and cordiality while the least indication of reserve on swann's part undraped in any such conventional formula as of course i don't want to say anything to which he would have scorned to descend appeared to them a deliberate act of treachery there are certain original and distinguished authors in whom the least 'freedom of speech' is thought revolting because they have not begun by flattering the public taste and serving up to it the commonplace expressions to which it is used it was by the same process that swann infuriated m verdurin in his case as in theirs it was the novelty of his language which led his audience to suspect the blackness of his designs swann was still unconscious of the disgrace that threatened him at the verdurins' and continued to regard all their absurdities in the most rosy light through the admiring eyes of love as a rule he made no appointments with odette except for the evenings he was afraid of her growing tired of him if he visited her during the day as well at the same time he was reluctant to forfeit even for an hour the place that he held in her thoughts and so was constantly looking out for an opportunity of claiming her attention in any way that would not be displeasing to her if in a florist's or a jeweller's window a plant or an ornament caught his eye he would at once think of sending them to odette imagining that the pleasure which the casual sight of them had given him would instinctively be felt also by her and would increase her affection for himself and he would order them to be taken at once to the rue la pérouse so as to accelerate the moment in which as she received an offering from him he might feel himself in a sense transported into her presence he was particularly anxious always that she should receive these presents before she went out for the evening so that her sense of gratitude towards him might give additional tenderness to her welcome when he arrived at the verdurins' might even for all he knew if the shopkeeper made haste bring him a letter from her before dinner or herself in person upon his doorstep come on a little extraordinary visit of thanks as in an earlier phase when he had experimented with the reflex action of anger and contempt upon her character he sought now by that of gratification to elicit from her fresh particles of her intimate feelings which she had never yet revealed often she was embarrassed by lack of money and under pressure from a creditor would come to him for assistance he enjoyed this as he enjoyed everything which could impress odette with his love for herself or merely with his influence with the extent of the use that she might make of him probably if anyone had said to him at the beginning it's your position that attracts her or at this stage it's your money that she's really in love with he would not have believed the suggestion nor would he have been greatly distressed by the thought that people supposed her to be attached to him that people felt them to be united by any ties so binding as those of snobbishness or wealth but even if he had accepted the possibility it might not have caused him any suffering to discover that odette's love for him was based on a foundation more lasting than mere affection or any attractive qualities which she might have found in him on a sound commercial interest an interest which would postpone for ever the fatal day on which she might be tempted to bring their relations to an end for the moment while he lavished presents upon her and performed all manner of services he could rely on advantages not contained in his person or in his intellect could forego the endless killing effort to make himself attractive and this delight in being a lover in living by love alone of the reality of which he was inclined to be doubtful the price which in the long run he must pay for it as a dilettante in immaterial sensations enhanced its value in his eyes as one sees people who are doubtful whether the sight of the sea and the sound of its waves are really enjoyable become convinced that they are as also of the rare quality and absolute detachment of their own taste when they have agreed to pay several pounds a day for a room in an hotel from which that sight and that sound may be enjoyed one day when reflections of this order had brought him once again to the memory of the time when some one had spoken to him of odette as of a 'kept' woman and when once again he had amused himself with contrasting that strange personification the 'kept' woman an iridescent mixture of unknown and demoniacal qualities embroidered as in some fantasy of gustave moreau with poison dripping flowers interwoven with precious jewels with that odette upon whose face he had watched the passage of the same expressions of pity for a sufferer resentment of an act of injustice gratitude for an act of kindness which he had seen in earlier days on his own mother's face and on the faces of friends that odette whose conversation had so frequently turned on the things that he himself knew better than anyone his collections his room his old servant his banker who kept all his title deeds and bonds the thought of the banker reminded him that he must call on him shortly to draw some money and indeed if during the current month he were to come less liberally to the aid of odette in her financial difficulties than in the month before when he had given her five thousand francs if he refrained from offering her a diamond necklace for which she longed he would be allowing her admiration for his generosity to decline that gratitude which had made him so happy and would even be running the risk of her imagining that his love for her as she saw its visible manifestations grow fewer had itself diminished and then suddenly he asked himself whether that was not precisely what was implied by 'keeping' a woman as if in fact that idea of 'keeping' could be derived from elements not at all mysterious nor perverse but belonging to the intimate routine of his daily life such as that thousand franc note a familiar and domestic object torn in places and mended with gummed paper which his valet after paying the household accounts and the rent had locked up in a drawer in the old writing desk whence he had extracted it to send it with four others to odette and whether it was not possible to apply to odette since he had known her for he never imagined for a moment that she could ever have taken a penny from anyone else before that title which he had believed so wholly inapplicable to her of 'kept' woman he could not explore the idea further for a sudden access of that mental lethargy which was with him congenital intermittent and providential happened at that moment to extinguish every particle of light in his brain as instantaneously as at a later period when electric lighting had been everywhere installed it became possible merely by fingering a switch to cut off all the supply of light from a house his mind fumbled for a moment in the darkness he took off his spectacles wiped the glasses passed his hands over his eyes but saw no light until he found himself face to face with a wholly different idea the realisation that he must endeavour in the coming month to send odette six or seven thousand franc notes instead of five simply as a surprise for her and to give her pleasure in the evening when he did not stay at home until it was time to meet odette at the verdurins' or rather at one of the open air restaurants which they liked to frequent in the bois and especially at saint cloud he would go to dine in one of those fashionable houses in which at one time he had been a constant guest he did not wish to lose touch with people who for all that he knew might be of use some day to odette and thanks to whom he was often in the meantime able to procure for her some privilege or pleasure besides he had been used for so long to the refinement and comfort of good society that side by side with his contempt there had grown up also a desperate need for it with the result that when he had reached the point after which the humblest lodgings appeared to him as precisely on a par with the most princely mansions his senses were so thoroughly accustomed to the latter that he could not enter the former without a feeling of acute discomfort he had the same regard to a degree of identity which they would never have suspected for the little families with small incomes who asked him to dances in their flats straight upstairs to the fifth floor and the door on the left as for the princesse de parme who gave the most splendid parties in paris but he had not the feeling of being actually 'at the ball' when he found himself herded with the fathers of families in the bedroom of the lady of the house while the spectacle of wash hand stands covered over with towels and of beds converted into cloak rooms with a mass of hats and great coats sprawling over their counterpanes gave him the same stifling sensation that nowadays people who have been used for half a lifetime to electric light derive from a smoking lamp or a candle that needs to be snuffed if he were dining out he would order his carriage for half past seven while he changed his clothes he would be wondering all the time about odette and in this way was never alone for the constant thought of odette gave to the moments in which he was separated from her the same peculiar charm as to those in which she was at his side he would get into his carriage and drive off but he knew that this thought had jumped in after him and had settled down upon his knee like a pet animal which he might take everywhere and would keep with him at the dinner table unobserved by his fellow guests he would stroke and fondle it warm himself with it and as a feeling of languor swept over him would give way to a slight shuddering movement which contracted his throat and nostrils a new experience this as he fastened the bunch of columbines in his buttonhole he had for some time been feeling neither well nor happy especially since odette had brought forcheville to the verdurins' and he would have liked to go away for a while to rest in the country but he could never summon up courage to leave paris even for a day while odette was there the weather was warm it was the finest part of the spring and for all that he was driving through a city of stone to immure himself in a house without grass or garden what was incessantly before his eyes was a park which he owned near combray where at four in the afternoon before coming to the asparagus bed thanks to the breeze that was wafted across the fields from méséglise he could enjoy the fragrant coolness of the air as well beneath an arbour of hornbeams in the garden as by the bank of the pond fringed with forget me not and iris and where when he sat down to dinner trained and twined by the gardener's skilful hand there ran all about his table currant bush and rose after dinner if he had an early appointment in the bois or at saint cloud he would rise from table and leave the house so abruptly especially if it threatened to rain and so to scatter the 'faithful' before their normal time that on one occasion the princesse des laumes at whose house dinner had been so late that swann had left before the coffee came in to join the verdurins on the island in the bois observed really if swann were thirty years older and had diabetes there might be some excuse for his running away like that he seems to look upon us all as a joke he persuaded himself that the spring time charm which he could not go down to combray to enjoy he would find at least on the he des cygnes or at saint cloud but as he could think only of odette he would return home not knowing even if he had tasted the fragrance of the young leaves or if the moon had been shining he would be welcomed by the little phrase from the sonata played in the garden on the restaurant piano if there was none in the garden the verdurins would have taken immense pains to have a piano brought out either from a private room or from the restaurant itself not because swann was now restored to favour far from it but the idea of arranging an ingenious form of entertainment for some one even for some one whom they disliked would stimulate them during the time spent in its preparation to a momentary sense of cordiality and affection now and then he would remind himself that another fine spring evening was drawing to a close and would force himself to notice the trees and the sky but the state of excitement into which odette's presence never failed to throw him added to a feverish ailment which for some time now had scarcely left him robbed him of that sense of quiet and comfort which is an indispensable background to the impressions that we derive from nature one evening when swann had consented to dine with the verdurins and had mentioned during dinner that he had to attend next day the annual banquet of an old comrades' association odette had at once exclaimed across the table in front of everyone in front of forcheville who was now one of the 'faithful ' in front of the painter in front of cottard yes i know you have your banquet to morrow i sha'n't see you then till i get home don't be too late and although swann had never yet taken offence at all seriously at odette's demonstrations of friendship for one or other of the 'faithful ' he felt an exquisite pleasure on hearing her thus avow before them all with that calm immodesty the fact that they saw each other regularly every evening his privileged position in her house and her own preference for him which it implied it was true that swann had often reflected that odette was in no way a remarkable woman and in the supremacy which he wielded over a creature so distinctly inferior to himself there was nothing that especially flattered him when he heard it proclaimed to all the 'faithful' but since he had observed that to several other men than himself odette seemed a fascinating and desirable woman the attraction which her body held for him had aroused a painful longing to secure the absolute mastery of even the tiniest particles of her heart and he had begun to attach an incalculable value to those moments passed in her house in the evenings when he held her upon his knee made her tell him what she thought about this or that and counted over that treasure to which alone of all his earthly possessions he still clung and so after this dinner drawing her aside he took care to thank her effusively seeking to indicate to her by the extent of his gratitude the corresponding intensity of the pleasures which it was in her power to bestow on him the supreme pleasure being to guarantee him immunity for as long as his love should last and he remain vulnerable from the assaults of jealousy when he came away from his banquet the next evening it was pouring rain and he had nothing but his victoria a friend offered to take him home in a closed carriage and as odette by the fact of her having invited him to come had given him an assurance that she was expecting no one else he could with a quiet mind and an untroubled heart rather than set off thus in the rain have gone home and to bed but perhaps if she saw that he seemed not to adhere to his resolution to end every evening without exception in her company she might grow careless and fail to keep free for him just the one evening on which he particularly desired it it was after eleven when he reached her door and as he made his apology for having been unable to come away earlier she complained that it was indeed very late the storm had made her unwell her head ached and she warned him that she would not let him stay longer than half an hour that at midnight she would send him away a little while later she felt tired and wished to sleep no cattleya then to night he asked and i've been looking forward so to a nice little cattleya but she was irresponsive saying nervously no dear no cattleya tonight can't you see i'm not well it might have done you good but i won't bother you she begged him to put out the light before he went he drew the curtains close round her bed and left her but when he was in his own house again the idea suddenly struck him that perhaps odette was expecting some one else that evening that she had merely pretended to be tired that she had asked him to put the light out only so that he should suppose that she was going to sleep that the moment he had left the house she had lighted it again and had reopened her door to the stranger who was to be her guest for the night he looked at his watch it was about an hour and a half since he had left her he went out took a cab and stopped it close to her house in a little street running at right angles to that other street which lay at the back of her house and along which he used to go sometimes to tap upon her bedroom window for her to let him in he left his cab the streets were all deserted and dark he walked a few yards and came out almost opposite her house amid the glimmering blackness of all the row of windows the lights in which had long since been put out he saw one and only one from which overflowed between the slats of its shutters dosed like a wine press over its mysterious golden juice the light that filled the room within a light which on so many evenings as soon as he saw it far off as he turned into the street had rejoiced his heart with its message she is there expecting you and now tortured him with she is there with the man she was expecting he must know who he tiptoed along by the wall until he reached the window but between the slanting bars of the shutters he could see nothing he could hear only in the silence of the night the murmur of conversation what agony he suffered as he watched that light in whose golden atmosphere were moving behind the closed sash the unseen and detested pair as he listened to that murmur which revealed the presence of the man who had crept in after his own departure the perfidy of odette and the pleasures which she was at that moment tasting with the stranger and yet he was not sorry that he had come the torment which had forced him to leave his own house had lost its sharpness when it lost its uncertainty now that odette's other life of which he had had at that first moment a sudden helpless suspicion was definitely there almost within his grasp before his eyes in the full glare of the lamp light caught and kept there an unwitting prisoner in that room into which when he would he might force his way to surprise and seize it or rather he would tap upon the shutters as he had often done when he had come there very late and by that signal odette would at least learn that he knew that he had seen the light and had heard the voices while he himself who a moment ago had been picturing her as laughing at him as sharing with that other the knowledge of how effectively he had been tricked now it was he that saw them confident and persistent in their error tricked and trapped by none other than himself whom they believed to be a mile away but who was there in person there with a plan there with the knowledge that he was going in another minute to tap upon the shutter and perhaps what he felt almost an agreeable feeling at that moment was something more than relief at the solution of a doubt at the soothing of a pain was an intellectual pleasure if since he had fallen in love things had recovered a little of the delicate attraction that they had had for him long ago though only when a light was shed upon them by a thought a memory of odette now it was another of the faculties prominent in the studious days of his youth that odette had quickened with new life the passion for truth but for a truth which too was interposed between himself and his mistress receiving its light from her alone a private and personal truth the sole object of which an infinitely precious object and one almost impersonal in its absolute beauty was odette odette in her activities her environment her projects and her past at every other period in his life the little everyday words and actions of another person had always seemed wholly valueless to swann if gossip about such things were repeated to him he would dismiss it as insignificant and while he listened it was only the lowest the most commonplace part of his mind that was interested at such moments he felt utterly dull and uninspired but in this strange phase of love the personality of another person becomes so enlarged so deepened that the curiosity which he could now feel aroused in himself to know the least details of a woman's daily occupation was the same thirst for knowledge with which he had once studied history and all manner of actions from which until now he would have recoiled in shame such as spying to night outside a window to morrow for all he knew putting adroitly provocative questions to casual witnesses bribing servants listening at doors seemed to him now to be precisely on a level with the deciphering of manuscripts the weighing of evidence the interpretation of old monuments that was to say so many different methods of scientific investigation each one having a definite intellectual value and being legitimately employable in the search for truth as his hand stole out towards the shutters he felt a pang of shame at the thought that odette would now know that he had suspected her that he had returned that he had posted himself outside her window she had often told him what a horror she had of jealous men of lovers who spied what he was going to do would be extremely awkward and she would detest him for ever after whereas now for the moment for so long as he refrained from knocking perhaps even in the act of infidelity she loved him still how often is not the prospect of future happiness thus sacrificed to one's impatient insistence upon an immediate gratification but his desire to know the truth was stronger and seemed to him nobler than his desire for her he knew that the true story of certain events which he would have given his life to be able to reconstruct accurately and in full was to be read within that window streaked with bars of light as within the illuminated golden boards of one of those precious manuscripts by whose wealth of artistic treasures the scholar who consults them cannot remain unmoved he yearned for the satisfaction of knowing the truth which so impassioned him in that brief fleeting precious transcript on that translucent page so warm so beautiful and besides the advantage which he felt which he so desperately wanted to feel that he had over them lay perhaps not so much in knowing as in being able to shew them that he knew he drew himself up on tiptoe he knocked they had not heard he knocked again louder their conversation ceased a man's voice he strained his ears to distinguish whose among such of odette's friends as he knew the voice could be asked who's that he could not be certain of the voice he knocked once again the window first then the shutters were thrown open it was too late now to retire and since she must know all so as not to seem too contemptible too jealous and inquisitive he called out in a careless hearty welcoming tone please don't bother i just happened to be passing and saw the light i wanted to know if you were feeling better he looked up two old gentlemen stood facing him in the window one of them with a lamp in his hand and beyond them he could see into the room a room that he had never seen before having fallen into the habit when he came late to odette of identifying her window by the fact that it was the only one still lighted in a row of windows otherwise all alike he had been misled this time by the light and had knocked at the window beyond hers in the adjoining house he made what apology he could and hurried home overjoyed that the satisfaction of his curiosity had preserved their love intact and that having feigned for so long when in odette's company a sort of indifference he had not now by a demonstration of jealousy given her that proof of the excess of his own passion which in a pair of lovers fully and finally dispenses the recipient from the obligation to love the other enough he never spoke to her of this misadventure he ceased even to think of it himself but now and then his thoughts in their wandering course would come upon this memory where it lay unobserved would startle it into life thrust it more deeply down into his consciousness and leave him aching with a sharp far rooted pain as though this had been a bodily pain swann's mind was powerless to alleviate it in the case of bodily pain however since it is independent of the mind the mind can dwell upon it can note that it has diminished that it has momentarily ceased but with this mental pain the mind merely by recalling it created it afresh to determine not to think of it was but to think of it still to suffer from it still and when in conversation with his friends he forgot his sufferings suddenly a word casually uttered would make him change countenance as a wounded man does when a clumsy hand has touched his aching limb when he came away from odette he was happy he felt calm he recalled the smile with which in gentle mockery she had spoken to him of this man or of that a smile which was all tenderness for himself he recalled the gravity of her head which she seemed to have lifted from its axis to let it droop and fall as though against her will upon his lips as she had done on that first evening in the carriage her languishing gaze at him while she lay nestling in his arms her bended head seeming to recede between her shoulders as though shrinking from the cold but then at once his jealousy as it had been the shadow of his love presented him with the complement with the converse of that new smile with which she had greeted him that very evening with which now perversely she was mocking swann while she tendered her love to another of that lowering of her head but lowered now to fall on other lips and but bestowed upon a stranger of all the marks of affection that she had shewn to him and all these voluptuous memories which he bore away from her house were as one might say but so many sketches rough plans like the schemes of decoration which a designer submits to one in outline enabling swann to form an idea of the various attitudes aflame or faint with passion which she was capable of adopting for others with the result that he came to regret every pleasure that he tasted in her company every new caress that he invented and had been so imprudent as to point out to her how delightful it was every fresh charm that he found in her for he knew that a moment later they would go to enrich the collection of instruments in his secret torture chamber a fresh turn was given to the screw when swann recalled a sudden expression which he had intercepted a few days earlier and for the first time in odette's eyes it was after dinner at the verdurins' whether it was because forcheville aware that saniette his brother in law was not in favour with them had decided to make a butt of him and to shine at his expense or because he had been annoyed by some awkward remark which saniette had made to him although it had passed unnoticed by the rest of the party who knew nothing of whatever tactless allusion it might conceal or possibly because he had been for some time looking out for an opportunity of securing the expulsion from the house of a fellow guest who knew rather too much about him and whom he knew to be so nice minded that he himself could not help feeling embarrassed at times merely by his presence in the room forcheville replied to saniette's tactless utterance with such a volley of abuse going out of his way to insult him emboldened the louder he shouted by the fear the pain the entreaties of his victim that the poor creature after asking mme verdurin whether he should stay and receiving no answer had left the house in stammering confusion and with tears in his eyes odette had looked on impassive at this scene but when the door had closed behind saniette she had forced the normal expression of her face down as the saying is by several pegs so as to bring herself on to the same level of vulgarity as forcheville her eyes had sparkled with a malicious smile of congratulation upon his audacity of ironical pity for the poor wretch who had been its victim she had darted at him a look of complicity in the crime which so clearly implied that's finished him off or i'm very much mistaken did you see what a fool he looked he was actually crying that forcheville when his eyes met hers sobered in a moment from the anger or pretended anger with which he was still flushed smiled as he explained he need only have made himself pleasant and he'd have been here still a good scolding does a man no harm at any time one day when swann had gone out early in the afternoon to pay a call and had failed to find the person at home whom he wished to see it occurred to him to go instead to odette at an hour when although he never went to her house then as a rule he knew that she was always at home resting or writing letters until tea time and would enjoy seeing her for a moment if it did not disturb her the porter told him that he believed odette to be in swann rang the bell thought that he heard a sound that he heard footsteps but no one came to the door anxious and annoyed he went round to the other little street at the back of her house and stood beneath her bedroom window the curtains were drawn and he could see nothing he knocked loudly upon the pane he shouted still no one came he could see that the neighbours were staring at him he turned away thinking that after all he had perhaps been mistaken in believing that he heard footsteps but he remained so preoccupied with the suspicion that he could turn his mind to nothing else after waiting for an hour he returned he found her at home she told him that she had been in the house when he rang but had been asleep the bell had awakened her she had guessed that it must be swann and had run out to meet him but he had already gone she had of course heard him knocking at the window swann could at once detect in this story one of those fragments of literal truth which liars when taken by surprise console themselves by introducing into the composition of the falsehood which they have to invent thinking that it can be safely incorporated and will lend the whole story an air of verisimilitude it was true that when odette had just done something which she did not wish to disclose she would take pains to conceal it in a secret place in her heart but as soon as she found herself face to face with the man to whom she was obliged to lie she became uneasy all her ideas melted like wax before a flame her inventive and her reasoning faculties were paralysed she might ransack her brain but would find only a void still she must say something and there lay within her reach precisely the fact which she had wished to conceal which being the truth was the one thing that had remained she broke off from it a tiny fragment of no importance in itself assuring herself that after all it was the best thing to do since it was a detail of the truth and less dangerous therefore than a falsehood at any rate this is true she said to herself that's always something to the good he may make inquiries he will see that this is true it won't be this anyhow that will give me away but she was wrong it was what gave her away she had not taken into account that this fragmentary detail of the truth had sharp edges which could not be made to fit in except to those contiguous fragments of the truth from which she had arbitrarily detached it edges which whatever the fictitious details in which she might embed it would continue to shew by their overlapping angles and by the gaps which she had forgotten to fill that its proper place was elsewhere she admits that she heard me ring and then knock that she knew it was myself that she wanted to see me swann thought to himself but that doesn't correspond with the fact that she did not let me in he did not however draw her attention to this inconsistency for he thought that if left to herself odette might perhaps produce some falsehood which would give him a faint indication of the truth she spoke he did not interrupt her he gathered up with an eager and sorrowful piety the words that fell from her lips feeling and rightly feeling since she was hiding the truth behind them as she spoke that like the veil of a sanctuary they kept a vague imprint traced a faint outline of that infinitely precious and alas undiscoverable truth what she had been doing that afternoon at three o'clock when he had called a truth of which he would never possess any more than these falsifications illegible and divine traces a truth which would exist henceforward only in the secretive memory of this creature who would contemplate it in utter ignorance of its value but would never yield it up to him it was true that he had now and then a strong suspicion that odette's daily activities were not in themselves passionately interesting and that such relations as she might have with other men did not exhale naturally in a universal sense or for every rational being a spirit of morbid gloom capable of infecting with fever or of inciting to suicide he realised at such moments that that interest that gloom existed in him only as a malady might exist and that once he was cured of the malady the actions of odette the kisses that she might have bestowed would become once again as innocuous as those of countless other women but the consciousness that the painful curiosity with which swann now studied them had its origin only in himself was not enough to make him decide that it was unreasonable to regard that curiosity as important and to take every possible step to satisfy it swann had in fact reached an age the philosophy of which supported in his case by the current philosophy of the day as well as by that of the circle in which he had spent most of his life the group that surrounded the princesse des laumes in which one's intelligence was understood to increase with the strength of one's disbelief in everything and nothing real and incontestable was to be discovered except the individual tastes of each of its members is no longer that of youth but a positive almost a medical philosophy the philosophy of men who instead of fixing their aspirations upon external objects endeavour to separate from the accumulation of the years already spent a definite residue of habits and passions which they can regard as characteristic and permanent and with which they will deliberately arrange before anything else that the kind of existence which they choose to adopt shall not prove inharmonious swann deemed it wise to make allowance in his life for the suffering which he derived from not knowing what odette had done just as he made allowance for the impetus which a damp climate always gave to his eczema to anticipate in his budget the expenditure of a considerable sum on procuring with regard to the daily occupations of odette information the lack of which would make him unhappy just as he reserved a margin for the gratification of other tastes from which he knew that pleasure was to be expected at least before he had fallen in love such as his taste for collecting things or for good cooking when he proposed to take leave of odette and to return home she begged him to stay a little longer and even detained him forcibly seizing him by the arm as he was opening the door to go but he gave no thought to that for among the crowd of gestures and speeches and other little incidents which go to make up a conversation it is inevitable that we should pass without noticing anything that arouses our interest by those that hide a truth for which our suspicions are blindly searching whereas we stop to examine others beneath which nothing lies concealed she kept on saying what a dreadful pity you never by any chance come in the afternoon and the one time you do come then i miss you he knew very well that she was not sufficiently in love with him to be so keenly distressed merely at having missed his visit but as she was a good natured woman anxious to give him pleasure and often sorry when she had done anything that annoyed him he found it quite natural that she should be sorry on this occasion that she had deprived him of that pleasure of spending an hour in her company which was so very great a pleasure if not to herself at any rate to him all the same it was a matter of so little importance that her air of unrelieved sorrow began at length to bewilder him she reminded him even more than was usual of the faces of some of the women created by the painter of the primavera ' she had at that moment their downcast heartbroken expression which seems ready to succumb beneath the burden of a grief too heavy to be borne when they are merely allowing the infant jesus to play with a pomegranate or watching moses pour water into a trough he had seen the same sorrow once before on her face but when he could no longer say then suddenly he remembered it it was when odette had lied in apologising to mme verdurin on the evening after the dinner from which she had stayed away on a pretext of illness but really so that she might be alone with swann surely even had she been the most scrupulous of women she could hardly have felt remorse for so innocent a lie but the lies which odette ordinarily told were less innocent and served to prevent discoveries which might have involved her in the most terrible difficulties with one or another of her friends and so when she lied smitten with fear feeling herself to be but feebly armed for her defence unconfident of success she was inclined to weep from sheer exhaustion as children weep sometimes when they have not slept she knew also that her lie as a rule was doing a serious injury to the man to whom she was telling it and that she might find herself at his mercy if she told it badly therefore she felt at once humble and culpable in his presence and when she had to tell an insignificant social lie its hazardous associations and the memories which it recalled would leave her weak with a sense of exhaustion and penitent with a consciousness of wrongdoing what depressing lie was she now concocting for swann's benefit to give her that pained expression that plaintive voice which seemed to falter beneath the effort that she was forcing herself to make and to plead for pardon he had an idea that it was not merely the truth about what had occurred that afternoon that she was endeavouring to hide from him but something more immediate something possibly which had not yet happened but might happen now at any time and when it did would throw a light upon that earlier event at that moment he heard the front door bell ring odette never stopped speaking but her words dwindled into an inarticulate moan her regret at not having seen swann that afternoon at not having opened the door to him had melted into a universal despair he could hear the gate being closed and the sound of a carriage as though some one were going away probably the person whom swann must on no account meet after being told that odette was not at home and then when he reflected that merely by coming at an hour when he was not in the habit of coming he had managed to disturb so many arrangements of which she did not wish him to know he had a feeling of discouragement that amounted almost to distress but since he was in love with odette since he was in the habit of turning all his thoughts towards her the pity with which he might have been inspired for himself he felt for her only and murmured poor darling when finally he left her she took up several letters which were lying on the table and asked him if he would be so good as to post them for her he walked along to the post office took the letters from his pocket and before dropping each of them into the box scanned its address they were all to tradesmen except the last which was to forcheville he kept it in his hand if i saw what was in this he argued i should know what she calls him what she says to him whether there really is anything between them perhaps if i don't look inside i shall be lacking in delicacy towards odette since in this way alone i can rid myself of a suspicion which is perhaps a calumny on her which must in any case cause her suffering and which can never possibly be set at rest once the letter is posted he left the post office and went home but he had kept the last letter in his pocket he lighted a candle and held up close to its flame the envelope which he had not dared to open at first he could distinguish nothing but the envelope was thin and by pressing it down on to the stiff card which it enclosed he was able through the transparent paper to read the concluding words they were a coldly formal signature if instead of its being himself who was looking at a letter addressed to forcheville it had been forcheville who had read a letter addressed to swann he might have found words in it of another a far more tender kind he took a firm hold of the card which was sliding to and fro the envelope being too large for it and then by moving it with his finger and thumb brought one line after another beneath the part of the envelope where the paper was not doubled through which alone it was possible to read in spite of all these manoeuvres he could not make it out clearly not that it mattered for he had seen enough to assure himself that the letter was about some trifling incident of no importance and had nothing at all to do with love it was something to do with odette's uncle swann had read quite plainly at the beginning of the line i was right but did not understand what odette had been right in doing until suddenly a word which he had not been able at first to decipher came to light and made the whole sentence intelligible i was right to open the door it was my uncle to open the door then forcheville had been there when swann rang the bell and she had sent him away hence the sound that swann had heard after that he read the whole letter at the end she apologised for having treated forcheville with so little ceremony and reminded him that he had left his cigarette case at her house precisely what she had written to swann after one of his first visits but to swann she had added why did you not forget your heart also i should never have let you have that back to forcheville nothing of that sort no allusion that could suggest any intrigue between them and really he was obliged to admit that in all this business forcheville had been worse treated than himself since odette was writing to him to make him believe that her visitor had been an uncle from which it followed that he swann was the man to whom she attached importance and for whose sake she had sent the other away and yet if there had been nothing between odette and forcheville why not have opened the door at once why have said i was right to open the door it was my uncle right if she was doing nothing wrong at that moment how could forcheville possibly have accounted for her not opening the door for a time swann stood still there heartbroken bewildered and yet happy gazing at this envelope which odette had handed to him without a scruple so absolute was her trust in his honour through its transparent window there had been disclosed to him with the secret history of an incident which he had despaired of ever being able to learn a fragment of the life of odette seen as through a narrow luminous incision cut into its surface without her knowledge then his jealousy rejoiced at the discovery as though that jealousy had had an independent existence fiercely egotistical gluttonous of every thing that would feed its vitality even at the expense of swann himself now it had food in store and swann could begin to grow uneasy afresh every evening over the visits that odette had received about five o'clock and could seek to discover where forcheville had been at that hour for swann's affection for odette still preserved the form which had been imposed on it from the beginning by his ignorance of the occupations in which she passed her days as well as by the mental lethargy which prevented him from supplementing that ignorance by imagination he was not jealous at first of the whole of odette's life but of those moments only in which an incident which he had perhaps misinterpreted had led him to suppose that odette might have played him false his jealousy like an octopus which throws out a first then a second and finally a third tentacle fastened itself irremovably first to that moment five o'clock in the afternoon then to another then to another again but swann was incapable of inventing his sufferings they were only the memory the perpetuation of a suffering that had come to him from without from without however everything brought him fresh suffering he decided to separate odette from forcheville by taking her away for a few days to the south but he imagined that she was coveted by every male person in the hotel and that she coveted them in return and so he who in old days when he travelled used always to seek out new people and crowded places might now be seen fleeing savagely from human society as if it had cruelly injured him and how could he not have turned misanthrope when in every man he saw a potential lover for odette thus his jealousy did even more than the happy passionate desire which he had originally felt for odette had done to alter swann's character completely changing in the eyes of the world even the outward signs by which that character had been intelligible a month after the evening on which he had intercepted and read odette's letter to forcheville swann went to a dinner which the verdurins were giving in the bois as the party was breaking up he noticed a series of whispered discussions between mme verdurin and several of her guests and thought that he heard the pianist being reminded to come next day to a party at chatou now he swann had not been invited to any party the verdurins had spoken only in whispers and in vague terms but the painter perhaps without thinking shouted out there must be no lights of any sort and he must play the moonlight sonata in the dark for us to see by mme verdurin seeing that swann was within earshot assumed that expression in which the two fold desire to make the speaker be quiet and to preserve oneself an appearance of guilelessness in the eyes of the listener is neutralised in an intense vacuity in which the unflinching signs of intelligent complicity are overlaid by the smiles of innocence an expression invariably adopted by anyone who has noticed a blunder the enormity of which is thereby at once revealed if not to those who have made it at any rate to him in whose hearing it ought not to have been made odette seemed suddenly to be in despair as though she had decided not to struggle any longer against the crushing difficulties of life and swann was anxiously counting the minutes that still separated him from the point at which after leaving the restaurant while he drove her home he would be able to ask for an explanation to make her promise either that she would not go to chatou next day or that she would procure an invitation for him also and to lull to rest in her arms the anguish that still tormented him at last the carriages were ordered mme verdurin said to swann good bye then we shall see you soon i hope trying by the friendliness of her manner and the constraint of her smile to prevent him from noticing that she was not saying as she would always have until then to morrow then at chatou and at my house the day after m and mme verdurin made forcheville get into their carriage swann's was drawn up behind it and he waited for theirs to start before helping odette into his own odette we'll take you said mme verdurin we've kept a little corner specially for you beside m de forcheville yes mme verdurin said odette meekly what i thought i was to take you home cried swann flinging discretion to the winds for the carriage door hung open time was precious and he could not in his present state go home without her but mme verdurin has asked me that's all right you can quite well go home alone we've left you like this dozens of times said mme verdurin but i had something important to tell mme de crécy very well you can write it to her instead good bye said odette holding out her hand he tried hard to smile but could only succeed in looking utterly dejected what do you think of the airs that swann is pleased to put on with us mme verdurin asked her husband when they had reached home i was afraid he was going to eat me simply because we offered to take odette back it really is too bad that sort of thing why doesn't he say straight out that we keep a disorderly house i can't conceive how odette can stand such manners he positively seems to be saying all the time 'you belong to me ' i shall tell odette exactly what i think about it all and i hope she will have the sense to understand me a moment later she added inarticulate with rage no but don't you see the filthy creature using unconsciously and perhaps in satisfaction of the same obscure need to justify herself like françoise at combray when the chicken refused to die the very words which the last convulsions of an inoffensive animal in its death agony wring from the peasant who is engaged in taking its life and when mme verdurin's carriage had moved on and swann's took its place his coachman catching sight of his face asked whether he was unwell or had heard bad news swann sent him away he preferred to walk and it was on foot through the bois that he came home he talked to himself aloud and in the same slightly affected tone which he had been used to adopt when describing the charms of the 'little nucleus' and extolling the magnanimity of the verdurins but just as the conversation the smiles the kisses of odette became as odious to him as he had once found them charming if they were diverted to others than himself so the verdurins' drawing room which not an hour before had still seemed to him amusing inspired with a genuine feeling for art and even with a sort of moral aristocracy now that it was another than himself whom odette was going to meet there to love there without restraint laid bare to him all its absurdities its stupidity its shame he drew a fanciful picture at which he shuddered in disgust of the party next evening at chatou imagine going to chatou of all places like a lot of drapers after closing time upon my word these people are sublime in their smugness they can't really exist they must all have come out of one of labiche's plays the cottards would be there possibly brichot could anything be more grotesque than the lives of these little creatures hanging on to one another like that they'd imagine they were utterly lost upon my soul they would if they didn't all meet again to morrow at chatou alas there would be the painter there also the painter who enjoyed match making who would invite forcheville to come with odette to his studio he could see odette in a dress far too smart for the country for she is so vulgar in that way and poor little thing she is such a fool he could hear the jokes that mme verdurin would make after dinner jokes which whoever the 'bore' might be at whom they were aimed had always amused him because he could watch odette laughing at them laughing with him her laughter almost a part of his now he felt that it was possibly at him that they would make odette laugh what a fetid form of humour he exclaimed twisting his mouth into an expression of disgust so violent that he could feel the muscles of his throat stiffen against his collar how in god's name can a creature made in his image find anything to laugh at in those nauseating witticisms the least sensitive nose must be driven away in horror from such stale exhalations it is really impossible to believe that any human being is incapable of understanding that in allowing herself merely to smile at the expense of a fellow creature who has loyally held out his hand to her she is casting herself into a mire from which it will be impossible with the best will in the world ever to rescue her i dwell so many miles above the puddles in which these filthy little vermin sprawl and crawl and bawl their cheap obscenities that i cannot possibly be spattered by the witticisms of a verdurin he cried tossing up his head and arrogantly straightening his body god knows that i have honestly attempted to pull odette out of that sewer and to teach her to breathe a nobler and a purer air but human patience has its limits and mine is at an end he concluded as though this sacred mission to tear odette away from an atmosphere of sarcasms dated from longer than a few minutes ago as though he had not undertaken it only since it had occurred to him that those sarcasms might perchance be directed at himself and might have the effect of detaching odette from him he could see the pianist sitting down to play the moonlight sonata and the grimaces of mme verdurin in terrified anticipation of the wrecking of her nerves by beethoven's music idiot liar he shouted and a creature like that imagines that she's fond of art she would say to odette after deftly insinuating a few words of praise for forcheville as she had so often done for himself you can make room for m de forcheville there can't you odette ' in the dark ' codfish pander 'pander' was the name he applied also to the music which would invite them to sit in silence to dream together to gaze in each other's eyes to feel for each other's hands he felt that there was much to be said after all for a sternly censorous attitude towards the arts such as plato adopted and bossuet and the old school of education in france in a word the life which they led at the verdurins' which he had so often described as 'genuine ' seemed to him now the worst possible form of life and their 'little nucleus' the most degraded class of society it really is he repeated beneath the lowest rung of the social ladder the nethermost circle of dante beyond a doubt the august words of the florentine refer to the verdurins when one comes to think of it surely people 'in society' and though one may find fault with them now and then still after all they are a very different matter from that gang of blackmailers shew a profound sagacity in refusing to know them or even to dirty the tips of their fingers with them what a sound intuition there is in that ' noli me tangere ' motto of the faubourg saint germain he had long since emerged from the paths and avenues of the bois he had almost reached his own house and still for he had not yet thrown off the intoxication of grief or his whim of insincerity but was ever more and more exhilarated by the false intonation the artificial sonority of his own voice he continued to perorate aloud in the silence of the night people 'in society' have their failings as no one knows better than i but after all they are people to whom some things at least are impossible so and so a fashionable woman whom he had known was far from being perfect but after all one did find in her a fundamental delicacy a loyalty in her conduct which made her whatever happened incapable of a felony which fixes a vast gulf between her and an old hag like verdurin verdurin what a name oh there's something complete about them something almost fine in their trueness to type they're the most perfect specimens of their disgusting class thank god it was high time that i stopped condescending to promiscuous intercourse with such infamy such dung but just as the virtues which he had still attributed an hour or so earlier to the verdurins would not have sufficed even although the verdurins had actually possessed them if they had not also favoured and protected his love to excite swann to that state of intoxication in which he waxed tender over their magnanimity an intoxication which even when disseminated through the medium of other persons could have come to him from odette alone so the immorality had it really existed which he now found in the verdurins would have been powerless if they had not invited odette with forcheville and without him to unstop the vials of his wrath and to make him scarify their 'infamy ' doubtless swann's voice shewed a finer perspicacity than his own when it refused to utter those words full of disgust at the verdurins and their circle and of joy at his having shaken himself free of it save in an artificial and rhetorical tone and as though his words had been chosen rather to appease his anger than to express his thoughts the latter in fact while he abandoned himself to invective were probably though he did not know it occupied with a wholly different matter for once he had reached his house no sooner had he closed the front door behind him than he suddenly struck his forehead and making his servant open the door again dashed out into the street shouting in a voice which this time was quite natural i believe i have found a way of getting invited to the dinner at chatou to morrow but it must have been a bad way for m swann was not invited dr cottard who having been summoned to attend a serious case in the country had not seen the verdurins for some days and had been prevented from appearing at chatou said on the evening after this dinner as he sat down to table at their house why aren't we going to see m swann this evening he is quite what you might call a personal friend i sincerely trust that we sha'n't cried mme verdurin heaven preserve us from him he's too deadly for words a stupid ill bred boor on hearing these words cottard exhibited an intense astonishment blended with entire submission as though in the face of a scientific truth which contradicted everything that he had previously believed but was supported by an irresistible weight of evidence with timorous emotion he bowed his head over his plate and merely replied oh oh oh oh oh traversing in an orderly retirement of his forces into the depths of his being along a descending scale the whole compass of his voice after which there was no more talk of swann at the verdurins' and so that drawing room which had brought swann and odette together became an obstacle in the way of their meeting she no longer said to him as she had said in the early days of their love we shall meet anyhow to morrow evening there's a supper party at the verdurins' but we sha'n't be able to meet to morrow evening there's a supper party at the verdurins' or else the verdurins were taking her to the opéra comique to see une nuit de cléopâtre and swann could read in her eyes that terror lest he should ask her not to go which but a little time before he could not have refrained from greeting with a kiss as it flitted across the face of his mistress but which now exasperated him yet i'm not really angry he assured himself when i see how she longs to run away and scratch from maggots in that dunghill of cacophony i'm disappointed not for myself but for her disappointed to find that after living for more than six months in daily contact with myself she has not been capable of improving her mind even to the point of spontaneously eradicating from it a taste for victor massé more than that to find that she has not arrived at the stage of understanding that there are evenings on which anyone with the least shade of refinement of feeling should be willing to forego an amusement when she is asked to do so she ought to have the sense to say 'i shall not go ' if it were only from policy since it is by what she answers now that the quality of her soul will be determined once and for all and having persuaded himself that it was solely after all in order that he might arrive at a favourable estimate of odette's spiritual worth that he wished her to stay at home with him that evening instead of going to the opéra comique he adopted the same line of reasoning with her with the same degree of insincerity as he had used with himself or even with a degree more for in her case he was yielding also to the desire to capture her by her own self esteem i swear to you he told her shortly before she was to leave for the theatre that in asking you not to go i should hope were i a selfish man for nothing so much as that you should refuse for i have a thousand other things to do this evening and i shall feel that i have been tricked and trapped myself and shall be thoroughly annoyed if after all you tell me that you are not going but my occupations my pleasures are not everything i must think of you also a day may come when seeing me irrevocably sundered from you you will be entitled to reproach me with not having warned you at the decisive hour in which i felt that i was going to pass judgment on you one of those stern judgments which love cannot long resist you see your nuit de cléopâtre what a title has no bearing on the point what i must know is whether you are indeed one of those creatures in the lowest grade of mentality and even of charm one of those contemptible creatures who are incapable of foregoing a pleasure for if you are such how could anyone love you for you are not even a person a definite imperfect but at least perceptible entity you are a formless water that will trickle down any slope that it may come upon a fish devoid of memory incapable of thought which all its life long in its aquarium will continue to dash itself a hundred times a day against a wall of glass always mistaking it for water do you realise that your answer will have the effect i do not say of making me cease from that moment to love you that goes without saying but of making you less attractive to my eyes when i realise that you are not a person that you are beneath everything in the world and have not the intelligence to raise yourself one inch higher obviously i should have preferred to ask you as though it had been a matter of little or no importance to give up your nuit de cléopâtre since you compel me to sully my lips with so abject a name in the hope that you would go to it none the less but since i had resolved to weigh you in the balance to make so grave an issue depend upon your answer i considered it more honourable to give you due warning meanwhile odette had shewn signs of increasing emotion and uncertainty although the meaning of his tirade was beyond her she grasped that it was to be included among the scenes of reproach or supplication scenes which her familiarity with the ways of men enabled her without paying any heed to the words that were uttered to conclude that men would not make unless they were in love that from the moment when they were in love it was superfluous to obey them since they would only be more in love later on and so she would have heard swann out with the utmost tranquillity had she not noticed that it was growing late and that if he went on speaking for any length of time she would never as she told him with a fond smile obstinate but slightly abashed get there in time for the overture on other occasions he had assured himself that the one thing which more than anything else would make him cease to love her would be her refusal to abandon the habit of lying even from the point of view of coquetry pure and simple he had told her can't you see how much of your attraction you throw away when you stoop to lying by a frank admission how many faults you might redeem really you are far less intelligent than i supposed in vain however did swann expound to her thus all the reasons that she had for not lying they might have succeeded in overthrowing any universal system of mendacity but odette had no such system she contented herself merely whenever she wished swann to remain in ignorance of anything that she had done with not telling him of it so that a lie was to her something to be used only as a special expedient and the one thing that could make her decide whether she should avail herself of a lie or not was a reason which too was of a special and contingent order namely the risk of swann's discovering that she had not told him the truth physically she was passing through an unfortunate phase she was growing stouter and the expressive sorrowful charm the surprised wistful expressions which she had formerly had seemed to have vanished with her first youth with the result that she became most precious to swann at the very moment when he found her distinctly less good looking he would gaze at her for hours on end trying to recapture the charm which he had once seen in her and could not find again and yet the knowledge that within this new and strange chrysalis it was still odette that lurked still the same volatile temperament artful and evasive was enough to keep swann seeking with as much passion as ever to captivate her then he would look at photographs of her taken two years before and would remember how exquisite she had been and that would console him a little for all the sufferings that he voluntarily endured on her account when the verdurins took her off to saint germain or to chatou or to meulan as often as not if the weather was fine they would propose to remain there for the night and not go home until next day mme verdurin would endeavour to set at rest the scruples of the pianist whose aunt had remained in paris she will be only too glad to be rid of you for a day how on earth could she be anxious when she knows you're with us anyhow i'll take you all under my wing she can put the blame on me if this attempt failed m verdurin would set off across country until he came to a telegraph office or some other kind of messenger after first finding out which of the 'faithful' had anyone whom they must warn but odette would thank him and assure him that she had no message for anyone for she had told swann once and for all that she could not possibly send messages to him before all those people without compromising herself sometimes she would be absent for several days on end when the verdurins took her to see the tombs at dreux or to compiègne on the painter's advice to watch the sun setting through the forest after which they went on to the château of pierrefonds to think that she could visit really historic buildings with me who have spent ten years in the study of architecture who am constantly bombarded by people who really count to take them over beauvais or saint loup de naud and refuse to take anyone but her and instead of that she trundles off with the lowest the most brutally degraded of creatures to go into ecstasies over the petrified excretions of louis philippe and viollet le duc one hardly needs much knowledge of art i should say to do that though surely even without any particularly refined sense of smell one would not deliberately choose to spend a holiday in the latrines so as to be within range of their fragrant exhalations but when she had set off for dreux or pierrefonds alas without allowing him to appear there as though by accident at her side for as she said that would create a dreadful impression he would plunge into the most intoxicating romance in the lover's library the railway timetable from which he learned the ways of joining her there in the afternoon in the evening even in the morning the ways more than that the authority the right to join her for after all the time table and the trains themselves were not meant for dogs if the public were carefully informed by means of printed advertisements that at eight o'clock in the morning a train started for pierrefonds which arrived there at ten that could only be because going to pierrefonds was a lawful act for which permission from odette would be superfluous an act moreover which might be performed from a motive altogether different from the desire to see odette since persons who had never even heard of her performed it daily and in such numbers as justified the labour and expense of stoking the engines so it came to this that she could not prevent him from going to pierrefonds if he chose to do so now that was precisely what he found that he did choose to do and would at that moment be doing were he like the travelling public not acquainted with odette for a long time past he had wanted to form a more definite impression of viollet le duc's work as a restorer and the weather being what it was he felt an overwhelming desire to spend the day roaming in the forest of compiègne it was indeed a piece of bad luck that she had forbidden him access to the one spot that tempted him to day to day why if he went down there in defiance of her prohibition he would be able to see her that very day but then whereas if she had met at pierrefonds some one who did not matter she would have hailed him with obvious pleasure what you here and would have invited him to come and see her at the hotel where she was staying with the verdurins if on the other hand it was himself swann that she encountered there she would be annoyed would complain that she was being followed would love him less in consequence might even turn away in anger when she caught sight of him so then i am not to be allowed to go away for a day anywhere she would reproach him on her return whereas in fact it was he himself who was not allowed to go he had had the sudden idea so as to contrive to visit compiègne and pierrefonds without letting it be supposed that his object was to meet odette of securing an invitation from one of his friends the marquis de forestelle who had a country house in that neighbourhood this friend to whom swann suggested the plan without disclosing its ulterior purpose was beside himself with joy he did not conceal his astonishment at swann's consenting at last after fifteen years to come down and visit his property and since he did not he told him wish to stay there promised to spend some days at least in taking him for walks and excursions in the district swann imagined himself down there already with m de forestelle even before he saw odette even if he did not succeed in seeing her there what a joy it would be to set foot on that soil where not knowing the exact spot in which at any moment she was to be found he would feel all around him the thrilling possibility of her suddenly appearing in the courtyard of the château now beautiful in his eyes since it was on her account that he had gone to visit it in all the streets of the town which struck him as romantic down every ride of the forest roseate with the deep and tender glow of sunset innumerable and alternative hiding places to which would fly simultaneously for refuge in the uncertain ubiquity of his hopes his happy vagabond and divided heart we mustn't on any account he would warn m de forestelle run across odette and the verdurins i have just heard that they are at pierrefonds of all places to day one has plenty of time to see them in paris it would hardly be worth while coming down here if one couldn't go a yard without meeting them and his host would fail to understand why once they had reached the place swann would change his plans twenty times in an hour inspect the dining rooms of all the hotels in compiègne without being able to make up his mind to settle down in any of them although he had found no trace anywhere of the verdurins seeming to be in search of what he had claimed to be most anxious to avoid and would in fact avoid the moment he found it for if he had come upon the little 'group ' he would have hastened away at once with studied indifference satisfied that he had seen odette and she him especially that she had seen him when he was not apparently thinking about her but no she would guess at once that it was for her sake that he had come there and when m de forestelle came to fetch him and it was time to start he excused himself no i'm afraid not i can't go to pierrefonds to day you see odette is there and swann was happy in spite of everything in feeling that if he alone among mortals had not the right to go to pierrefonds that day it was because he was in fact for odette some one who differed from all other mortals her lover and because that restriction which for him alone was set upon the universal right to travel freely where one would was but one of the many forms of that slavery that love which was so dear to him decidedly it was better not to risk a quarrel with her to be patient to wait for her return he spent his days in poring over a map of the forest of compiègne as though it had been that of the 'pays du tendre' he surrounded himself with photographs of the château of pierrefonds when the day dawned on which it was possible that she might return he opened the time table again calculated what train she must have taken and should she have postponed her departure what trains were still left for her to take he did not leave the house for fear of missing a telegram he did not go to bed in case having come by the last train she decided to surprise him with a midnight visit yes the front door bell rang there seemed some delay in opening the door he wanted to awaken the porter he leaned out of the window to shout to odette if it was odette for in spite of the orders which he had gone downstairs a dozen times to deliver in person they were quite capable of telling her that he was not at home it was only a servant coming in he noticed the incessant rumble of passing carriages to which he had never before paid any attention he could hear them one after another a long way off coming nearer passing his door without stopping and bearing away into the distance a message which was not for him he waited all night to no purpose for the verdurins had returned unexpectedly and odette had been in paris since midday it had not occurred to her to tell him not knowing what to do with herself she had spent the evening alone at a theatre had long since gone home to bed and was peacefully asleep as a matter of fact she had never given him a thought and such moments as these in which she forgot swann's very existence were of more value to odette did more to attach him to her than all her infidelities for in this way swann was kept in that state of painful agitation which had once before been effective in making his interest blossom into love on the night when he had failed to find odette at the verdurins' and had hunted for her all evening and he did not have as i had afterwards at combray in my childhood happy days in which to forget the sufferings that would return with the night for his days swann must pass them without odette and as he told himself now and then to allow so pretty a woman to go out by herself in paris was just as rash as to leave a case filled with jewels in the middle of the street in this mood he would scowl furiously at the passers by as though they were so many pickpockets but their faces a collective and formless mass escaped the grasp of his imagination and so failed to feed the flame of his jealousy the effort exhausted swann's brain until passing his hand over his eyes he cried out heaven help me as people after lashing themselves into an intellectual frenzy in their endeavours to master the problem of the reality of the external world or that of the immortality of the soul afford relief to their weary brains by an unreasoning act of faith but the thought of his absent mistress was incessantly indissolubly blended with all the simplest actions of swann's daily life when he took his meals opened his letters went for a walk or to bed by the fact of his regret at having to perform those actions without her like those initials of philibert the fair which in the church of brou because of her grief her longing for him margaret of austria intertwined everywhere with her own on some days instead of staying at home he would go for luncheon to a restaurant not far off to which he had been attracted some time before by the excellence of its cookery but to which he now went only for one of those reasons at once mystical and absurd which people call 'romantic' because this restaurant which by the way still exists bore the same name as the street in which odette lived the lapérouse sometimes when she had been away on a short visit somewhere several days would elapse before she thought of letting him know that she had returned to paris and then she would say quite simply without taking as she would once have taken the precaution of covering herself at all costs with a little fragment borrowed from the truth that she had just at that very moment arrived by the morning train what she said was a falsehood at least for odette it was a falsehood inconsistent lacking what it would have had if true the support of her memory of her actual arrival at the station she was even prevented from forming a mental picture of what she was saying while she said it by the contradictory picture in her mind of whatever quite different thing she had indeed been doing at the moment when she pretended to have been alighting from the train in swann's mind however these words meeting no opposition settled and hardened until they assumed the indestructibility of a truth so indubitable that if some friend happened to tell him that he had come by the same train and had not seen odette swann would have been convinced that it was his friend who had made a mistake as to the day or hour since his version did not agree with the words uttered by odette these words had never appeared to him false except when before hearing them he had suspected that they were going to be for him to believe that she was lying an anticipatory suspicion was indispensable it was also however sufficient given that everything that odette might say appeared to him suspect did she mention a name it was obviously that of one of her lovers once this supposition had taken shape he would spend weeks in tormenting himself on one occasion he even approached a firm of 'inquiry agents' to find out the address and the occupation of the unknown rival who would give him no peace until he could be proved to have gone abroad and who he ultimately learned was an uncle of odette and had been dead for twenty years although she would not allow him as a rule to meet her at public gatherings saying that people would talk it happened occasionally that at an evening party to which he and she had each been invited at forcheville's at the painter's or at a charity ball given in one of the ministries he found himself in the same room with her he could see her but dared not remain for fear of annoying her by seeming to be spying upon the pleasures which she tasted in other company pleasures which while he drove home in utter loneliness and went to bed as anxiously as i myself was to go to bed some years later on the evenings when he came to dine with us at combray seemed illimitable to him since he had not been able to see their end and once or twice he derived from such evenings that kind of happiness which one would be inclined did it not originate in so violent a reaction from an anxiety abruptly terminated to call peaceful since it consists in a pacifying of the mind he had looked in for a moment at a revel in the painter's studio and was getting ready to go home he was leaving behind him odette transformed into a brilliant stranger surrounded by men to whom her glances and her gaiety which were not for him seemed to hint at some voluptuous pleasure to be enjoyed there or elsewhere possibly at the bal des incohérents to which he trembled to think that she might be going on afterwards which made swann more jealous than the thought of their actual physical union since it was more difficult to imagine he was opening the door to go when he heard himself called back in these words which by cutting off from the party that possible ending which had so appalled him made the party itself seem innocent in retrospect made odette's return home a thing no longer inconceivable and terrible but tender and familiar a thing that kept close to his side like a part of his own daily life in his carriage a thing that stripped odette herself of the excess of brilliance and gaiety in her appearance shewed that it was only a disguise which she had assumed for a moment for his sake and not in view of any mysterious pleasures a disguise of which she had already wearied in these words which odette flung out after him as he was crossing the threshold can't you wait a minute for me i'm just going we'll drive back together and you can drop me it was true that on one occasion forcheville had asked to be driven home at the same time but when on reaching odette's gate he had begged to be allowed to come in too she had replied with a finger pointed at swann ah that depends on this gentleman you must ask him very well you may come in just for a minute if you insist but you mustn't stay long for i warn you he likes to sit and talk quietly with me and he's not at all pleased if i have visitors when he's here oh if you only knew the creature as i know him isn't that so my love there's no one that really knows you is there except me and swann was perhaps even more touched by the spectacle of her addressing him thus in front of forcheville not only in these tender words of predilection but also with certain criticisms such as i feel sure you haven't written yet to your friends about dining with them on sunday you needn't go if you don't want to but you might at least be polite or now have you left your essay on vermeer here so that you can do a little more to it to morrow what a lazy bones i'm going to make you work i can tell you which proved that odette kept herself in touch with his social engagements and his literary work that they had indeed a life in common and as she spoke she bestowed on him a smile which he interpreted as meaning that she was entirely his and then while she was making them some orangeade suddenly just as when the reflector of a lamp that is badly fitted begins by casting all round an object on the wall beyond it huge and fantastic shadows which in time contract and are lost in the shadow of the object itself all the terrible and disturbing ideas which he had formed of odette melted away and vanished in the charming creature who stood there before his eyes he had the sudden suspicion that this hour spent in odette's house in the lamp light was perhaps after all not an artificial hour invented for his special use with the object of concealing that frightening and delicious thing which was incessantly in his thoughts without his ever being able to form a satisfactory impression of it an hour of odette's real life of her life when he was not there looking on with theatrical properties and pasteboard fruits but was perhaps a genuine hour of odette's life that if he himself had not been there she would have pulled forward the same armchair for forcheville would have poured out for him not any unknown brew but precisely that orangeade which she was now offering to them both that the world inhabited by odette was not that other world fearful and supernatural in which he spent his time in placing her and which existed perhaps only in his imagination but the real universe exhaling no special atmosphere of gloom comprising that table at which he might sit down presently and write and this drink which he was being permitted now to taste all the objects which he contemplated with as much curiosity and admiration as gratitude for if in absorbing his dreams they had delivered him from an obsession they themselves were in turn enriched by the absorption they shewed him the palpable realisation of his fancies and they interested his mind they took shape and grew solid before his eyes and at the same time they soothed his troubled heart ah had fate but allowed him to share a single dwelling with odette so that in her house he should be in his own if when asking his servant what there would be for luncheon it had been odette's bill of fare that he had learned from the reply if when odette wished to go for a walk in the morning along the avenue du bois de boulogne his duty as a good husband had obliged him though he had no desire to go out to accompany her carrying her cloak when she was too warm and in the evening after dinner if she wished to stay at home and not to dress if he had been forced to stay beside her to do what she asked then how completely would all the trivial details of swann's life which seemed to him now so gloomy simply because they would at the same time have formed part of the life of odette have taken on like that lamp that orangeade that armchair which had absorbed so much of his dreams which materialised so much of his longing a sort of superabundant sweetness and a mysterious solidity and yet he was inclined to suspect that the state for which he so much longed was a calm a peace which would not have created an atmosphere favourable to his love when odette ceased to be for him a creature always absent regretted imagined when the feeling that he had for her was no longer the same mysterious disturbance that was wrought in him by the phrase from the sonata but constant affection and gratitude when those normal relations were established between them which would put an end to his melancholy madness then no doubt the actions of odette's daily life would appear to him as being of but little intrinsic interest as he had several times already felt that they might be on the day for instance when he had read through its envelope her letter to forcheville examining his complaint with as much scientific detachment as if he had inoculated himself with it in order to study its effects he told himself that when he was cured of it what odette might or might not do would be indifferent to him but in his morbid state to tell the truth he feared death itself no more than such a recovery which would in fact amount to the death of all that he then was after these quiet evenings swann's suspicions would be temporarily lulled he would bless the name of odette and next day in the morning would order the most attractive jewels to be sent to her because her kindnesses to him overnight had excited either his gratitude or the desire to see them repeated or a paroxysm of love for her which had need of some such outlet but at other times grief would again take hold of him he would imagine that odette was forcheville's mistress and that when they had both sat watching him from the depths of the verdurins' landau in the bois on the evening before the party at chatou to which he had not been invited while he implored her in vain with that look of despair on his face which even his coachman had noticed to come home with him and then turned away solitary crushed she must have employed to draw forcheville's attention to him while she murmured do look at him storming the same glance brilliant malicious sidelong cunning as on the evening when forcheville had driven saniette from the verdurins' at such times swann detested her but i've been a fool too he would argue i'm paying for other men's pleasures with my money all the same she'd better take care and not pull the string too often for i might very well stop giving her anything at all at any rate we'd better knock off supplementary favours for the time being to think that only yesterday when she said she would like to go to bayreuth for the season i was such an ass as to offer to take one of those jolly little places the king of bavaria has there for the two of us however she didn't seem particularly keen she hasn't said yes or no yet let's hope that she'll refuse good god think of listening to wagner for a fortnight on end with her who takes about as much interest in music as a fish does in little apples it will be fun and his hatred like his love needing to manifest itself in action he amused himself with urging his evil imaginings further and further because thanks to the perfidies with which he charged odette he detested her still more and would be able if it turned out as he tried to convince himself that she was indeed guilty of them to take the opportunity of punishing her emptying upon her the overflowing vials of his wrath in this way he went so far as to suppose that he was going to receive a letter from her in which she would ask him for money to take the house at bayreuth but with the warning that he was not to come there himself as she had promised forcheville and the verdurins to invite them oh how he would have loved it had it been conceivable that she would have that audacity what joy he would have in refusing in drawing up that vindictive reply the terms of which he amused himself by selecting and declaiming aloud as though he had actually received her letter the very next day her letter came she wrote that the verdurins and their friends had expressed a desire to be present at these performances of wagner and that if he would be so good as to send her the money she would be able at last after going so often to their house to have the pleasure of entertaining the verdurins in hers of him she said not a word it was to be taken for granted that their presence at bayreuth would be a bar to his then that annihilating answer every word of which he had carefully rehearsed overnight without venturing to hope that it could ever be used he had the satisfaction of having it conveyed to her alas he felt only too certain that with the money which she had or could easily procure she would be able all the same to take a house at bayreuth since she wished to do so she who was incapable of distinguishing between bach and clapisson let her take it then she would have to live in it more frugally that was all no means as there would have been if he had replied by sending her several thousand franc notes of organising each evening in her hired castle those exquisite little suppers after which she might perhaps be seized by the whim which it was possible had never yet seized her of falling into the arms of forcheville at any rate this loathsome expedition it would not be swann who had to pay for it ah if he could only manage to prevent it if she could sprain her ankle before starting if the driver of the carriage which was to take her to the station would consent no matter how great the bribe to smuggle her to some place where she could be kept for a time in seclusion that perfidious woman her eyes tinselled with a smile of complicity for forcheville which was what odette had become for swann in the last forty eight hours but she was never that for very long after a few days the shining crafty eyes lost their brightness and their duplicity that picture of an execrable odette saying to forcheville look at him storming began to grow pale and to dissolve then gradually reappeared and rose before him softly radiant the face of the other odette of that odette who also turned with a smile to forcheville but with a smile in which there was nothing but affection for swann when she said you mustn't stay long for this gentleman doesn't much like my having visitors when he's here oh if you only knew the creature as i know him that same smile with which she used to thank swann for some instance of his courtesy which she prized so highly for some advice for which she had asked him in one of those grave crises in her life when she could turn to him alone then to this other odette he would ask himself what could have induced him to write that outrageous letter of which probably until then she had never supposed him capable a letter which must have lowered him from the high from the supreme place which by his generosity by his loyalty he had won for himself in her esteem he would become less dear to her since it was for those qualities which she found neither in forcheville nor in any other that she loved him it was for them that odette so often shewed him a reciprocal kindness which counted for less than nothing in his moments of jealousy because it was not a sign of reciprocal desire was indeed a proof rather of affection than of love but the importance of which he began once more to feel in proportion as the spontaneous relaxation of his suspicions often accelerated by the distraction brought to him by reading about art or by the conversation of a friend rendered his passion less exacting of reciprocities now that after this swing of the pendulum odette had naturally returned to the place from which swann's jealousy had for the moment driven her in the angle in which he found her charming he pictured her to himself as full of tenderness with a look of consent in her eyes and so beautiful that he could not refrain from moving his lips towards her as though she had actually been in the room for him to kiss and he preserved a sense of gratitude to her for that bewitching kindly glance as strong as though she had really looked thus at him and it had not been merely his imagination that had portrayed it in order to satisfy his desire what distress he must have caused her certainly he found adequate reasons for his resentment but they would not have been sufficient to make him feel that resentment if he had not so passionately loved her had he not nourished grievances just as serious against other women to whom he would none the less render willing service to day feeling no anger towards them because he no longer loved them if the day ever came when he would find himself in the same state of indifference with regard to odette he would then understand that it was his jealousy alone which had led him to find something atrocious unpardonable in this desire after all so natural a desire springing from a childlike ingenuousness and also from a certain delicacy in her nature to be able in her turn when an occasion offered to repay the verdurins for their hospitality and to play the hostess in a house of her own he returned to the other point of view opposite to that of his love and of his jealousy to which he resorted at times by a sort of mental equity and in order to make allowance for different eventualities from which he tried to form a fresh judgment of odette based on the supposition that he had never been in love with her that she was to him just a woman like other women that her life had not been whenever he himself was not present different a texture woven in secret apart from him and warped against him wherefore believe that she would enjoy down there with forcheville or with other men intoxicating pleasures which she had never known with him and which his jealousy alone had fabricated in all their elements at bayreuth as in paris if it should happen that forcheville thought of him at all it would only be as of some one who counted for a great deal in the life of odette some one for whom he was obliged to make way when they met in her house if forcheville and she scored a triumph by being down there together in spite of him it was he who had engineered that triumph by striving in vain to prevent her from going there whereas if he had approved of her plan which for that matter was quite defensible she would have had the appearance of being there by his counsel she would have felt herself sent there housed there by him and for the pleasure which she derived from entertaining those people who had so often entertained her it was to him that she would have had to acknowledge her indebtedness and if instead of letting her go off thus at cross purposes with him without having seen him again he were to send her this money if he were to encourage her to take this journey and to go out of his way to make it comfortable and pleasant for her she would come running to him happy grateful and he would have the joy the sight of her face which he had not known for nearly a week a joy which none other could replace for the moment that swann was able to form a picture of her without revulsion that he could see once again the friendliness in her smile and that the desire to tear her away from every rival was no longer imposed by his jealousy upon his love that love once again became more than anything a taste for the sensations which odette's person gave him for the pleasure which he found in admiring as one might a spectacle or in questioning as one might a phenomenon the birth of one of her glances the formation of one of her smiles the utterance of an intonation of her voice and this pleasure different from every other had in the end created in him a need of her which she alone by her presence or by her letters could assuage almost as disinterested almost as artistic as perverse as another need which characterised this new period in swann's life when the sereness the depression of the preceding years had been followed by a sort of spiritual superabundance without his knowing to what he owed this unlooked for enrichment of his life any more than a person in delicate health who from a certain moment grows stronger puts on flesh and seems for a time to be on the road to a complete recovery this other need which too developed in him independently of the visible material world was the need to listen to music and to learn to know it and so by the chemical process of his malady after he had created jealousy out of his love he began again to generate tenderness pity for odette she had become once more the old odette charming and kind he was full of remorse for having treated her harshly he wished her to come to him and before she came he wished to have already procured for her some pleasure so as to watch her gratitude taking shape in her face and moulding her smile so too odette certain of seeing him come to her in a few days as tender and submissive as before and plead with her for a reconciliation became inured was no longer afraid of displeasing him or even of making him angry and refused him whenever it suited her the favours by which he set most store perhaps she did not realise how sincere he had been with her during their quarrel when he had told her that he would not send her any money but would do what he could to hurt her perhaps she did not realise either how sincere he still was if not with her at any rate with himself on other occasions when for the sake of their future relations to shew odette that he was capable of doing without her that a rupture was still possible between them he decided to wait some time before going to see her again sometimes several days had elapsed during which she had caused him no fresh anxiety and as from the next few visits which he would pay her he knew that he was likely to derive not any great pleasure but more probably some annoyance which would put an end to the state of calm in which he found himself he wrote to her that he was very busy and would not be able to see her on any of the days that he had suggested meanwhile a letter from her crossing his asked him to postpone one of those very meetings he asked himself why his suspicions his grief again took hold of him he could no longer abide in the new state of agitation into which he found himself plunged by the arrangements which he had made in his preceding state of comparative calm he would run to find her and would insist upon seeing her on each of the following days and even if she had not written first if she merely acknowledged his letter it was enough to make him unable to rest without seeing her for upsetting all swann's calculations odette's acceptance had entirely changed his attitude like everyone who possesses something precious so as to know what would happen if he ceased for a moment to possess it he had detached the precious object from his mind leaving as he thought everything else in the same state as when it was there but the absence of one part from a whole is not only that it is not simply a partial omission it is a disturbance of all the other parts a new state which it was impossible to foresee from the old but at other times when odette was on the point of going away for a holiday it was after some trifling quarrel for which he had chosen the pretext that he decided not to write to her and not to see her until her return giving the appearance and expecting the reward of a serious rupture which she would perhaps regard as final to a separation the greater part of which was inevitable since she was going away which in fact he was merely allowing to start a little sooner than it must at once he could imagine odette puzzled anxious distressed at having received neither visit nor letter from him and this picture of her by calming his jealousy made it easy for him to break himself of the habit of seeing her at odd moments no doubt in the furthest recesses of his brain where his determination had thrust it away and thanks to the length of the interval the three weeks' separation to which he had agreed it was with pleasure that he would consider the idea that he would see odette again on her return but it was also with so little impatience that he began to ask himself whether he would not readily consent to the doubling of the period of so easy an abstinence it had lasted so far but three days a much shorter time than he had often before passed without seeing odette and without having as on this occasion he had premeditated a separation and yet there and then some tiny trace of contrariety in his mind or of weakness in his body by inciting him to regard the present as an exceptional moment one not to be governed by the rules one in which prudence itself would allow him to take advantage of the soothing effects of a pleasure and to give his will until the time should come when its efforts might serve any purpose a holiday suspended the action of his will which ceased to exert its inhibitive control or without that even the thought of some information for which he had forgotten to ask odette such as if she had decided in what colour she would have her carriage repainted or with regard to some investment whether they were 'ordinary' or 'preference' shares that she wished him to buy for it was all very well to shew her that he could live without seeing her but if after that the carriage had to be painted over again if the shares produced no dividend a fine lot of good he would have done and suddenly like a stretched piece of elastic which is let go or the air in a pneumatic machine which is ripped open the idea of seeing her again from the remote point in time to which it had been attached sprang back into the field of the present and of immediate possibilities it sprang back thus without meeting any further resistance so irresistible in fact that swann had been far less unhappy in watching the end gradually approaching day by day of the fortnight which he must spend apart from odette than he was when kept waiting ten minutes while his coachman brought round the carriage which was to take him to her minutes which he passed in transports of impatience and joy in which he recaptured a thousand times over to lavish on it all the wealth of his affection that idea of his meeting with odette which by so abrupt a repercussion at a moment when he supposed it so remote was once more present and on the very surface of his consciousness the fact was that this idea no longer found as an obstacle in its course the desire to contrive without further delay to resist its coming which had ceased to have any place in swann's mind since having proved to himself or so at least he believed that he was so easily capable of resisting it he no longer saw any inconvenience in postponing a plan of separation which he was now certain of being able to put into operation whenever he would furthermore this idea of seeing her again came back to him adorned with a novelty a seductiveness armed with a virulence all of which long habit had enfeebled but which had acquired new vigour during this privation not of three days but of a fortnight for a period of abstinence may be calculated by anticipation as having lasted already until the final date assigned to it and had converted what had been until then a pleasure in store which could easily be sacrificed into an unlooked for happiness which he was powerless to resist finally the idea returned to him with its beauty enhanced by his own ignorance of what odette might have thought might perhaps have done on finding that he shewed no sign of life with the result that he was going now to meet with the entrancing revelation of an odette almost unknown but she just as she had supposed that his refusal to send her money was only a feint saw nothing but a pretext in the question which he came now to ask her about the repainting of her carriage or the purchase of stock for she could not reconstruct the several phases of these crises through which he passed and in the general idea which she formed of them she made no attempt to understand their mechanism looking only to what she knew beforehand their necessary never failing and always identical termination an imperfect idea though possibly all the more profound in consequence if one were to judge it from the point of view of swann who would doubtless have considered that odette failed to understand him just as a morphinomaniac or a consumptive each persuaded that he has been thrown back one by some outside event at the moment when he was just going to shake himself free from his inveterate habit the other by an accidental indisposition at the moment when he was just going to be finally cured feels himself to be misunderstood by the doctor who does not attach the same importance to these pretended contingencies mere disguises according to him assumed so as to be perceptible by his patients by the vice of one and the morbid state of the other which in reality have never ceased to weigh heavily and incurably upon them while they were nursing their dreams of normality and health and as a matter of fact swann's love had reached that stage at which the physician and in the case of certain affections the boldest of surgeons ask themselves whether to deprive a patient of his vice or to rid him of his malady is still reasonable or indeed possible certainly of the extent of this love swann had no direct knowledge when he sought to measure it it happened sometimes that he found it diminished shrunken almost to nothing for instance the very moderate liking amounting almost to dislike which in the days before he was in love with odette he had felt for her expressive features her faded complexion returned on certain days really i am making distinct headway he would tell himself on the morrow when i come to think it over carefully i find out that i got hardly any pleasure last night out of being in bed with her it's an odd thing but i actually thought her ugly and certainly he was sincere but his love extended a long way beyond the province of physical desire odette's person indeed no longer held any great place in it when his eyes fell upon the photograph of odette on his table or when she came to see him he had difficulty in identifying her face either in the flesh or on the pasteboard with the painful and continuous anxiety which dwelt in his mind he would say to himself almost with astonishment it is she as when suddenly some one shews us in a detached externalised form one of our own maladies and we find in it no resemblance to what we are suffering she he tried to ask himself what that meant for it is something like love like death rather than like those vague conceptions of maladies a thing which one repeatedly calls in question in order to make oneself probe further into it in the fear that the question will find no answer that the substance will escape our grasp the mystery of personality and this malady which was swann's love had so far multiplied was so closely interwoven with all his habits with all his actions with his thoughts his health his sleep his life even with what he hoped for after his death was so entirely one with him that it would have been impossible to wrest it away without almost entirely destroying him as surgeons say his case was past operation by this love swann had been so far detached from all other interests that when by chance he reappeared in the world of fashion reminding himself that his social relations like a beautifully wrought setting although she would not have been able to form any very exact estimate of its worth might still add a little to his own value in odette's eyes as indeed they might have done had they not been cheapened by his love itself which for odette depreciated everything that it touched by seeming to denounce such things as less precious than itself he would feel there simultaneously with his distress at being in places and among people that she did not know the same detached sense of pleasure as he would have derived from a novel or a painting in which were depicted the amusements of a leisured class just as at home he used to enjoy the thought of the smooth efficiency of his household the smartness of his own wardrobe and of his servants' liveries the soundness of his investments with the same relish as when he read in saint simon who was one of his favourite authors of the machinery of daily life at versailles what mme de maintenon ate and drank or the shrewd avarice and great pomp of lulli and in the small extent to which this detachment was not absolute the reason for this new pleasure which swann was tasting was that he could emigrate for a moment into those few and distant parts of himself which had remained almost foreign to his love and to his pain in this respect the personality with which my great aunt endowed him of 'young swann ' as distinct from the more individual personality of charles swann was that in which he now most delighted once when because it was the birthday of the princesse de parme and because she could often be of use indirectly to odette by letting her have seats for galas and jubilees and all that sort of thing he had decided to send her a basket of fruit and was not quite sure where or how to order it he had entrusted the task to a cousin of his mother who delighted to be doing a commission for him had written to him laying stress on the fact that she had not chosen all the fruit at the same place but the grapes from crapote whose speciality they were the straw berries from jauret the pears from chevet who always had the best am soon every fruit visited and examined one by one by myself and in the sequel by the cordiality with which the princess thanked him he had been able to judge of the flavour of the strawberries and of the ripeness of the pears but most of all that every fruit visited and examined one by one by myself had brought balm to his sufferings by carrying his mind off to a region which he rarely visited although it was his by right as the heir of a rich and respectable middle class family in which had been handed down from generation to generation the knowledge of the 'right places' and the art of ordering things from shops of a truth he had too long forgotten that he was 'young swann' not to feel when he assumed that part again for a moment a keener pleasure than he was capable of feeling at other times when indeed he was grown sick of pleasure and if the friendliness of the middle class people for whom he had never been anything else than 'young swann ' was less animated than that of the aristocrats though more flattering for all that since in the middle class mind friendship is inseparable from respect no letter from a royal personage offering him some princely entertainment could ever be so attractive to swann as the letter which asked him to be a witness or merely to be present at a wedding in the family of some old friends of his parents some of whom had 'kept up' with him like my grandfather who the year before these events had invited him to my mother's wedding while others barely knew him by sight but were they thought in duty bound to shew civility to the son to the worthy successor of the late m swann but by virtue of his intimacy already time honoured with so many of them the people of fashion in a certain sense were also a part of his house his service and his family he felt when his mind dwelt upon his brilliant connections the same external support the same solid comfort as when he looked at the fine estate the fine silver the fine table linen which had come down to him from his forebears and the thought that if he were seized by a sudden illness and confined to the house the people whom his valet would instinctively run to find would be the duc de chartres the prince de reuss the duc de luxembourg and the baron de charlus brought him the same consolation as our old françoise derived from the knowledge that she would one day be buried in her own fine clothes marked with her name not darned at all or so exquisitely darned that it merely enhanced one's idea of the skill and patience of the seamstress a shroud from the constant image of which in her mind's eye she drew a certain satisfactory sense if not actually of wealth and prosperity at any rate of self esteem but most of all since in every one of his actions and thoughts which had reference to odette swann was constantly subdued and swayed by the unconfessed feeling that he was perhaps not less dear but at least less welcome to her than anyone even the most wearisome of the verdurins' 'faithful ' when he betook himself to a world in which he was the paramount example of taste a man whom no pains were spared to attract whom people were genuinely sorry not to see he began once again to believe in the existence of a happier life almost to feel an appetite for it as an invalid may feel who has been in bed for months and on a strict diet when he picks up a newspaper and reads the account of an official banquet or the advertisement of a cruise round sicily if he was obliged to make excuses to his fashionable friends for not paying them visits it was precisely for the visits that he did pay her that he sought to excuse himself to odette he still paid them asking himself at the end of each month whether seeing that he had perhaps exhausted her patience and had certainly gone rather often to see her it would be enough if he sent her four thousand francs and for each visit he found a pretext a present that he had to bring her some information which she required m de charlus whom he had met actually going to her house and who had insisted upon swann's accompanying him and failing any excuse he would beg m de charlus to go to her at once and to tell her as though spontaneously in the course of conversation that he had just remembered something that he had to say to swann and would she please send a message to swann's house asking him to come to her then and there but as a rule swann waited at home in vain and m de charlus informed him later in the evening that his device had not proved successful with the result that if she was now frequently away from paris even when she was there he scarcely saw her that she who when she was in love with him used to say i am always free and what can it matter to me what other people think now whenever he wanted to see her appealed to the proprieties or pleaded some engagement when he spoke of going to a charity entertainment or a private view or a first night at which she was to be present she would expostulate that he wished to advertise their relations in public that he was treating her like a woman off the streets things came to such a pitch that in an effort to save himself from being altogether forbidden to meet her anywhere swann remembering that she knew and was deeply attached to my great uncle adolphe whose friend he himself also had been went one day to see him in his little flat in the rue de bellechasse to ask him to use his influence with odette as it happened she invariably adopted when she spoke to swann about my uncle a poetical tone saying ah he he is not in the least like you it is an exquisite thing a great a beautiful thing his friendship for me he's not the sort of man who would have so little consideration for me as to let himself be seen with me everywhere in public this was embarrassing for swann who did not know quite to what rhetorical pitch he should screw himself up in speaking of odette to my uncle he began by alluding to her excellence a priori the axiom of her seraphic super humanity the revelation of her inexpressible virtues no conception of which could possibly be formed i should like to speak to you about her he went on you who know what a woman supreme above all women what an adorable being what an angel odette is but you know also what life is in paris everyone doesn't see odette in the light in which you and i have been privileged to see her and so there are people who think that i am behaving rather foolishly she won't even allow me to meet her out of doors at the theatre now you in whom she has such enormous confidence couldn't you say a few words for me to her just to assure her that she exaggerate the harm which my bowing to her in the street might do her my uncle advised swann not to see odette for some days after which she would love him all the more he advised odette to let swann meet her everywhere and as often as he pleased a few days later odette told swann that she had just had a rude awakening she had discovered that my uncle was the same as other men he had tried to take her by assault she calmed swann who at first was for rushing out to challenge my uncle to a duel but he refused to shake hands with him when they met again he regretted this rupture all the more because he had hoped if he had met my uncle adolphe again sometimes and had contrived to talk things over with him in strict confidence to be able to get him to throw a light on certain rumours with regard to the life that odette had led in the old days at nice for my uncle adolphe used to spend the winter there and swann thought that it might indeed have been there perhaps that he had first known odette the few words which some one had let fall in his hearing about a man who it appeared had been odette's lover had left swann dumbfounded but the very things which he would before knowing them have regarded as the most terrible to learn and the most impossible to believe were once he knew them incorporated for all time in the general mass of his sorrow he admitted them he could no longer have understood their not existing only each one of them in its passage traced an indelible line altering the picture that he had formed of his mistress at one time indeed he felt that he could understand that this moral 'lightness ' of which he would never have suspected odette was perfectly well known and that at baden or nice when she had gone in the past to spend several months in one or the other place she had enjoyed a sort of amorous notoriety he attempted in order to question them to get into touch again with certain men of that stamp but these were aware that he knew odette and besides he was afraid of putting the thought of her into their heads of setting them once more upon her track but he to whom up till then nothing could have seemed so tedious as was all that pertained to the cosmopolitan life of baden or of nice now that he learned that odette had perhaps led a 'gay' life once in those pleasure cities although he could never find out whether it had been solely to satisfy a want of money which thanks to himself she no longer felt or from some capricious instinct which might at any moment revive in her he would lean in impotent anguish blinded and dizzy over the bottomless abyss into which had passed in which had been engulfed those years of his own early in macmahon's septennat in which one spent the winter on the promenade des anglais the summer beneath the limes of baden and would find in those years a sad but splendid profundity such as a poet might have lent to them and he would have devoted to the reconstruction of all the insignificant details that made up the daily round on the côte d'azur in those days if it could have helped him to understand something that still baffled him in the smile or in the eyes of odette more enthusiasm than does the aesthete who ransacks the extant documents of fifteenth century florence so as to try to penetrate further into the soul of the primavera the fair vanna or the venus of botticelli he would sit often without saying a word to her only gazing at her and dreaming and she would comment you do look sad it was not very long since from the idea that she was an excellent creature comparable to the best women that he had known he had passed to that of her being 'kept' and yet already by an inverse process he had returned from the odette de crécy perhaps too well known to the holiday makers to the 'ladies' men' of nice and baden to this face the expression on which was so often gentle to this nature so eminently human he would ask himself what does it mean after all to say that everyone at nice knows who odette de crécy is reputations of that sort even when they're true are always based upon other people's ideas he would reflect that this legend even if it were authentic was something external to odette was not inherent in her like a mischievous and ineradicable personality that the creature who might have been led astray was a woman with frank eyes a heart full of pity for the sufferings of others a docile body which he had pressed tightly in his arms and explored with his fingers a woman of whom he might one day come into absolute possession if he succeeded in making himself indispensable to her there she was often tired her face left blank for the nonce by that eager feverish preoccupation with the unknown things which made swann suffer she would push back her hair with both hands her forehead her whole face would seem to grow larger then suddenly some ordinary human thought some worthy sentiment such as is to be found in all creatures when in a moment of rest or meditation they are free to express themselves would flash out from her eyes like a ray of gold and immediately the whole of her face would light up like a grey landscape swathed in clouds which suddenly are swept away and the dull scene transfigured at the moment of the sun's setting the life which occupied odette at such times even the future which she seemed to be dreamily regarding swann could have shared with her no evil disturbance seemed to have left any effect on them rare as they became those moments did not occur in vain by the process of memory swann joined the fragments together abolished the intervals between them cast as in molten gold the image of an odette compact of kindness and tranquillity for whom he was to make later on as we shall see in the second part of this story sacrifices which the other odette would never have won from him but how rare those moments were and how seldom he now saw her even in regard to their evening meetings she would never tell him until the last minute whether she would be able to see him for reckoning on his being always free she wished first to be certain that no one else would offer to come to her she would plead that she was obliged to wait for an answer which was of the very greatest importance and if even after she had made swann come to her house any of her friends asked her half way through the evening to join them at some theatre or at supper afterwards she would jump for joy and dress herself with all speed as her toilet progressed every movement that she made brought swann nearer to the moment when he would have to part from her when she would fly off with irresistible force and when at length she was ready and plunging into her mirror a last glance strained and brightened by her anxiety to look well smeared a little salve on her lips fixed a stray loci of hair over her brow and called for her cloak of sky blue silk with golden tassels swann would be looking so wretched that she would be unable to restrain a gesture of impatience as she flung at him so that is how you thank me for keeping you here till the last minute and i thought i was being so nice to you well i shall know better another time sometime at the risk of annoying her he made up his mind that he would find out where she had gone and even dreamed of a defensive alliance with forcheville who might perhaps have been able to tell him but anyhow when he knew with whom she was spending the evening it was very seldom that he could not discover among all his innumerable acquaintance some one who knew if only indirectly the man with whom she had gone out and could easily obtain this or that piece of information about him and while he was writing to one of his friends asking him to try to get a little light thrown upon some point or other he would feel a sense of relief on ceasing to vex himself with questions to which there was no answer and transferring to some one else the strain of interrogation it is true that swann was little the wiser for such information as he did receive to know a thing does not enable us always to prevent its happening but after all the things that we know we do hold if not in our hands at any rate in our minds where we can dispose of them as we choose which gives us the illusion of a sort of power to control them he was quite happy whenever m de charlus was with odette he knew that between m de charlus and her nothing untoward could ever happen that when m de charlus went anywhere with her it was out of friendship for himself and that he would make no difficulty about telling him everything that she had done sometimes she had declared so emphatically to swann that it was impossible for him to see her on a particular evening she seemed to be looking forward so keenly to some outing that swann attached a very real importance to the fact that m de charlus was free to accompany her next day without daring to put many questions to m de charlus he would force him by appearing not quite to understand his first answers to give him more after each of which he would feel himself increasingly relieved for he very soon learned that odette had spent her evening in the most innocent of dissipations but what do you mean my dear mémé i don't quite understand you didn't go straight from her house to the musée grévin surely you went somewhere else first no that is very odd you don't know how amusing you are my dear mémé but what an odd idea of hers to go on to the chat noir afterwards it was her idea i suppose no yours that's strange after all it wasn't a bad idea she must have known dozens of people there no she never spoke to a soul how extraordinary then you sat there like that just you and she all by yourselves i can picture you sitting there you are a worthy fellow my dear mémé i'm exceedingly fond of you swann was now quite at ease to him who had so often happened when talking to friends who knew nothing of his love friends to whom he hardly listened to hear certain detached sentences as for instance i saw mme de crécy yesterday she was with a man i didn't know sentences which dropped into his heart and passed at once into a solid state grew hard as stalagmites and seared and tore him as they lay there irremovable how charming by way of contrast were the words she didn't know a soul she never spoke to a soul how freely they coursed through him how fluid they were how vaporous how easy to breathe and yet a moment later he was telling himself that odette must find him very dull if those were the pleasures that she preferred to his company and their very insignificance though it reassured him pained him as if her enjoyment of them had been an act of treachery even when he could not discover where she had gone it would have sufficed to alleviate the anguish that he then felt for which odette's presence the charm of her company was the sole specific a specific which in the long run served like many other remedies to aggravate the disease but at least brought temporary relief to his sufferings it would have sufficed had odette only permitted him to remain in her house while she was out to wait there until that hour of her return into whose stillness and peace would flow to be mingled and lost there all memory of those intervening hours which some sorcery some cursed spell had made him imagine as somehow different from the rest but she would not he must return home he forced himself on the way to form various plans ceased to think of odette he even reached the stage while he undressed of turning over all sorts of happy ideas in his mind it was with a light heart buoyed with the anticipation of going to see some favourite work of art on the morrow that he jumped into bed and turned out the light but no sooner had he made himself ready to sleep relaxing a self control of which he was not even conscious so habitual had it become than an icy shudder convulsed his body and he burst into sobs he did not wish to know why but dried his eyes saying with a smile this is delightful i'm becoming neurasthenic after which he could not save himself from utter exhaustion at the thought that next day he must begin afresh his attempt to find out what odette had been doing must use all his influence to contrive to see her this compulsion to an activity without respite without variety without result was so cruel a scourge that one day noticing a swelling over his stomach he felt an actual joy in the idea that he had perhaps a tumour which would prove fatal that he need not concern himself with anything further that it was his malady which was going to govern his life to make a plaything of him until the not distant end if indeed at this period it often happened that though without admitting it even to himself he longed for death it was in order to escape not so much from the keenness of his sufferings as from the monotony of his struggle and yet he would have wished to live until the time came when he no longer loved her when she would have no reason for lying to him when at length he might learn from her whether on the day when he had gone to see her in the afternoon she had or had not been in the arms of forcheville often for several days on end the suspicion that she was in love with some one else would distract his mind from the question of forcheville making it almost immaterial to him like those new developments of a continuous state of ill health which seem for a little time to have delivered us from their predecessors there were even days when he was not tormented by any suspicion he fancied that he was cured but next morning when he awoke he felt in the same place the same pain a sensation which the day before he had as it were diluted in the torrent of different impressions but it had not stirred from its place indeed it was the sharpness of this pain that had awakened him since odette never gave him any information as to those vastly important matters which took up so much of her time every day albeit he had lived long enough in the world to know that such matters are never anything else than pleasures he could not sustain for any length of time the effort to imagine them his brain would become a void then he would pass a finger over his tired eyelids in the same way as he might have wiped his eyeglass and would cease altogether to think there emerged however from this unexplored tract certain occupations which reappeared from time to time vaguely connected by odette with some obligation towards distant relatives or old friends who inasmuch as they were the only people whom she was in the habit of mentioning as preventing her from seeing him seemed to swann to compose the necessary unalterable setting of her life because of the tone in which she referred from time to time to the day when i go with my friend to the hippodrome if when he felt unwell and had thought perhaps odette would be kind and come to see me he remembered suddenly that it was one of those very days he would correct himself with an oh no it's not worth while asking her to come i should have thought of it before this is the day when she goes with her friend to the hippodrome we must confine ourselves to what is possible no use wasting our time in proposing things that can't be accepted and are declined in advance and this duty that was incumbent upon odette of going to the hippodrome to which swann thus gave way seemed to him to be not merely ineluctable in itself but the mark of necessity which stamped it seemed to make plausible and legitimate everything that was even remotely connected with it if when odette in the street had acknowledged the salute of a passer by which had aroused swann's jealousy she replied to his questions by associating the stranger with any of the two or three paramount duties of which she had often spoken to him if for instance she said that's a gentleman who was in my friend's box the other day the one i go to the hippodrome with that explanation would set swann's suspicions at rest it was after all inevitable that this friend should have other guests than odette in her box at the hippodrome but he had never sought to form or succeeded in forming any coherent impression of them oh how he would have loved to know her that friend who went to the hippodrome how he would have loved her to invite him there with odette how readily he would have sacrificed all his acquaintance for no matter what person who was in the habit of seeing odette were she but a manicurist or a girl out of a shop he would have taken more trouble incurred more expense for them than for queens would they not have supplied him out of what was contained in their knowledge of the life of odette with the one potent anodyne for his pain with what joy would he have hastened to spend his days with one or other of those humble folk with whom odette kept up friendly relations either with some ulterior motive or from genuine simplicity of nature how willingly would he have fixed his abode for ever in the attics of some sordid but enviable house where odette went but never took him and where if he had lived with the little retired dressmaker whose lover he would readily have pretended to be he would have been visited by odette almost daily in those regions that were almost slums what a modest existence abject if you please but delightful nourished by tranquillity and happiness he would have consented to lead indefinitely it sometimes happened again that when after meeting swann she saw some man approaching whom he did not know he could distinguish upon odette's face that look of sorrow which she had worn on the day when he had come to her while forcheville was there but this was rare for on the days when in spite of all that she had to do and of her dread of what people would think she did actually manage to see swann the predominant quality in her attitude now was self assurance a striking contrast perhaps an unconscious revenge for perhaps a natural reaction from the timorous emotion which in the early days of their friendship she had felt in his presence and even in his absence when she began a letter to him with the words my dear my hand trembles so that i can scarcely write so at least she pretended and a little of that emotion must have been sincere or she would not have been anxious to enlarge and emphasise it so swann had been pleasing to her then our hands do not tremble except for ourselves or for those whom we love when they have ceased to control our happiness how peaceful how easy how bold do we become in their presence in speaking to him in writing to him now she no longer employed those words by which she had sought to give herself the illusion that he belonged to her creating opportunities for saying my and mine when she referred to him you are all that i have in the world it is the perfume of our friendship i shall keep it nor spoke to him of the future of death itself as of a single adventure which they would have to share in those early days whatever he might say to her she would answer admiringly you know you will never be like other people she would gaze at his long slightly bald head of which people who know only of his successes used to think he's not regularly good looking if you like but he is smart that tuft that eyeglass that smile and with more curiosity perhaps to know him as he really was than desire to become his mistress she would sigh i do wish i could find out what there is in that head of yours but now whatever he might say she would answer in a tone sometimes of irritation sometimes indulgent ah so you never will be like other people she would gaze at his head which was hardly aged at all by his recent anxieties though people now thought of it by the same mental process which enables one to discover the meaning of a piece of symphonic music of which one has read the programme or the 'likenesses' in a child whose family one has known he's not positively ugly if you like but he is really rather absurd that eyeglass that tuft that smile realising in their imagination fed by suggestion the invisible boundary which divides at a few months' interval the head of an ardent lover from a cuckold's and would say oh i do wish i could change you put some sense into that head of yours always ready to believe in the truth of what he hoped if it was only odette's way of behaving to him that left room for doubt he would fling himself greedily upon her words you can if you like he would tell her and he tried to explain to her that to comfort him to control him to make him work would be a noble task to which numbers of other women asked for nothing better than to be allowed to devote themselves though it is only fair to add that in those other women's hands the noble task would have seemed to swann nothing more than an indiscreet and intolerable usurpation of his freedom of action if she didn't love me just a little he told himself she would not wish to have me altered to alter me she will have to see me more often and so he was able to trace in these faults which she found in him a proof at least of her interest perhaps even of her love and in fact she gave him so little now of the last that he was obliged to regard as proofs of her interest in him the various things which every now and then she forbade him to do one day she announced that she did not care for his coachman who she thought was perhaps setting swann against her and anyhow did not shew that promptness and deference to swann's orders which she would have liked to see she felt that he wanted to hear her say don't have him again when you come to me just as he might have wanted her to kiss him so being in a good temper she said it and he was deeply moved that evening when talking to m de charlus with whom he had the satisfaction of being able to speak of her openly for the most trivial remarks that he uttered now even to people who had never heard of her had always some sort of reference to odette he said to him i believe all the same that she loves me she is so nice to me now and she certainly takes an interest in what i do and if when he was starting off for her house getting into his carriage with a friend whom he was to drop somewhere on the way his friend said hullo that isn't loredan on the box with what melancholy joy would swann answer him oh good heavens no i can tell you i daren't take loredan when i go to the rue la pérouse odette doesn't like me to have loredan she thinks he doesn't suit me what on earth is one to do women you know women my dear fellow she would be furious oh lord yes i've only to take rémi there i should never hear the last of it these new manners indifferent listless irritable which odette now adopted with swann undoubtedly made him suffer but he did not realise how much he suffered since it had been with a regular progression day after day that odette had chilled towards him it was only by directly contrasting what she was to day with what she had been at first that he could have measured the extent of the change that had taken place now this change was his deep his secret wound which pained him day and night and whenever he felt that his thoughts were straying too near it he would quickly turn them into another channel for fear of being made to suffer too keenly he might say to himself in a vague way there was a time when odette loved me more but he never formed any definite picture of that time just as he had in his study a cupboard at which he contrived never to look which he turned aside to avoid passing whenever he entered or left the room because in one of its drawers he had locked away the chrysanthemum which she had given him on one of those first evenings when he had taken her home in his carriage and the letters in which she said why did you not forget your heart also i should never have let you have that back and at whatever hour of the day or night you may need me just send me a word and dispose of me as you please so there was a place in his heart to which he would never allow his thoughts to trespass too near forcing them if need be to evade it by a long course of reasoning so that they should not have to pass within reach of it the place in which lingered his memories of happy days but his so meticulous prudence was defeated one evening when he had gone out to a party it was at the marquise de saint euverte's on the last for that season of the evenings on which she invited people to listen to the musicians who would serve later on for her charity concerts swann who had intended to go to each of the previous evenings in turn but had never been able to make up his mind received while he was dressing for this party a visit from the baron de charlus who came with an offer to go with him to the marquise's if his company could be of any use in helping swann not to feel quite so bored when he got there to be a little less unhappy but swann had thanked him with you can't conceive how glad i should be of your company but the greatest pleasure that you can give me will be if you will go instead to see odette you know what a splendid influence you have over her i don't suppose she'll be going anywhere this evening unless she goes to see her old dressmaker and i'm sure she would be delighted if you went with her there in any case you'll find her at home before then try to keep her amused and also to give her a little sound advice if you could arrange something for to morrow which would please her something that we could all three do together try to put out a feeler too for the summer see if there's anything she wants to do a cruise that we might all three take anything you can think of i don't count upon seeing her to night myself still if she would like me to come or if you find a loophole you've only to send me a line at mme de saint euverte's up till midnight after that i shall be here ever so many thanks for all you are doing for me you know what i feel about you his friend promised to go and do as swann wished as soon as he had deposited him at the door of the saint euverte house where he arrived soothed by the thought that m de charlus would be spending the evening in the rue la pérouse but in a state of melancholy indifference to everything that did not involve odette and in particular to the details of fashionable life a state which invested them with the charm that is to be found in anything which being no longer an object of our desire appears to us in its own guise on alighting from his carriage in the foreground of that fictitious summary of their domestic existence which hostesses are pleased to offer to their guests on ceremonial occasions and in which they shew a great regard for accuracy of costume and setting swann was amused to discover the heirs and successors of balzac's 'tigers' now 'grooms' who normally followed their mistress when she walked abroad but now hatted and booted were posted out of doors in front of the house on the gravelled drive or outside the stables as gardeners might be drawn up for inspection at the ends of their several flower beds the peculiar tendency which he had always had to look for analogies between living people and the portraits in galleries reasserted itself here but in a more positive and more general form it was society as a whole now that he was detached from it which presented itself to him in a series of pictures in the cloak room into which in the old days when he was still a man of fashion he would have gone in his overcoat to emerge from it in evening dress but without any impression of what had occurred there his mind having been during the minute or two that he had spent in it either still at the party which he had just left or already at the party into which he was just about to be ushered he now noticed for the first time roused by the unexpected arrival of so belated a guest the scattered pack of splendid effortless animals the enormous footmen who were drowsing here and there upon benches and chests until pointing their noble greyhound profiles they towered upon their feet and gathered in a circle round about him one of them of a particularly ferocious aspect and not unlike the headsman in certain renaissance pictures which represent executions tortures and the like advanced upon him with an implacable air to take his 'things ' but the harshness of his steely glare was compensated by the softness of his cotton gloves so effectively that as he approached swann he seemed to be exhibiting at once an utter contempt for his person and the most tender regard for his hat he took it with a care to which the precision of his movements imparted something that was almost over fastidious and with a delicacy that was rendered almost touching by the evidence of his splendid strength then he passed it to one of his satellites a novice and timid who was expressing the panic that overpowered him by casting furious glances in every direction and displayed all the dumb agitation of a wild animal in the first hours of its captivity a few feet away a strapping great lad in livery stood musing motionless statuesque useless like that purely decorative warrior whom one sees in the most tumultuous of mantegna's paintings lost in dreams leaning upon his shield while all around him are fighting and bloodshed and death detached from the group of his companions who were thronging about swann he seemed as determined to remain unconcerned in the scene which he followed vaguely with his cruel greenish eyes as if it had been the massacre of the innocents or the martyrdom of saint james he seemed precisely to have sprung from that vanished race if indeed it ever existed save in the reredos of san zeno and the frescoes of the eremitani where swann had come in contact with it and where it still dreams fruit of the impregnation of a classical statue by some one of the master's paduan models or of albert duerer's saxons and the locks of his reddish hair crinkled by nature but glued to his head by brilliantine were treated broadly as they are in that greek sculpture which the mantuan painter never ceased to study and which if in its creator's purpose it represents but man manages at least to extract from man's simple outlines such a variety of richness borrowed as it were from the whole of animated nature that a head of hair by the glossy undulation and beak like points of its curls or in the overlaying of the florid triple diadem of its brushed tresses can suggest at once a bunch of seaweed a brood of fledgling doves a bed of hyacinths and a serpent's writhing back others again no less colossal were disposed upon the steps of a monumental staircase which by their decorative presence and marmorean immobility was made worthy to be named like that god crowned ascent in the palace of the doges the 'staircase of the giants ' and on which swann now set foot saddened by the thought that odette had never climbed it ah with what joy would he on the other hand have raced up the dark evil smelling breakneck flights to the little dressmaker's in whose attic he would so gladly have paid the price of a weekly stage box at the opera for the right to spend the evening there when odette came and other days too for the privilege of talking about her of living among people whom she was in the habit of seeing when he was not there and who on that account seemed to keep secret among themselves some part of the life of his mistress more real more inaccessible and more mysterious than anything that he knew whereas upon that pestilential enviable staircase to the old dressmaker's since there was no other no service stair in the building one saw in the evening outside every door an empty unwashed milk can set out in readiness for the morning round upon the door mat on the despicable enormous staircase which swann was at that moment climbing on either side of him at different levels before each anfractuosity made in its walls by the window of the porter's lodge or the entrance to a set of rooms representing the departments of indoor service which they controlled and doing homage for them to the guests a gate keeper a major domo a steward worthy men who spent the rest of the week in semi independence in their own domains dined there by themselves like small shopkeepers and might to morrow lapse to the plebeian service of some successful doctor or industrial magnate scrupulous in carrying out to the letter all the instructions that had been heaped upon them before they were allowed to don the brilliant livery which they wore only at long intervals and in which they did not feel altogether at their ease stood each in the arcade of his doorway their splendid pomp tempered by a democratic good fellowship like saints in their niches and a gigantic usher dressed swiss guard fashion like the beadle in a church struck the pavement with his staff as each fresh arrival passed him coming to the top of the staircase up which he had been followed by a servant with a pallid countenance and a small pigtail clubbed at the back of his head like one of goya's sacristans or a tabellion in an old play swann passed by an office in which the lackeys seated like notaries before their massive registers rose solemnly to their feet and inscribed his name he next crossed a little hall which just as certain rooms are arranged by their owners to serve as the setting for a single work of art from which they take their name and in their studied bareness contain nothing else besides displayed to him as he entered it like some priceless effigy by benvenuto cellini of an armed watchman a young footman his body slightly bent forward rearing above his crimson gorget an even more crimson face from which seemed to burst forth torrents of fire timidity and zeal who as he pierced the aubusson tapestries that screened the door of the room in which the music was being given with his impetuous vigilant desperate gaze appeared with a soldierly impassibility or a supernatural faith an allegory of alarums incarnation of alertness commemoration of a riot to be looking out angel or sentinel from the tower of dungeon or cathedral for the approach of the enemy or for the hour of judgment swann had now only to enter the concert room the doors of which were thrown open to him by an usher loaded with chains who bowed low before him as though tendering to him the keys of a conquered city but he thought of the house in which at that very moment he might have been if odette had but permitted and the remembered glimpse of an empty milk can upon a door mat wrung his heart he speedily recovered his sense of the general ugliness of the human male when on the other side of the tapestry curtain the spectacle of the servants gave place to that of the guests but even this ugliness of faces which of course were mostly familiar to him seemed something new and uncanny now that their features instead of being to him symbols of practical utility in the identification of this or that man who until then had represented merely so many pleasures to be sought after boredoms to be avoided or courtesies to be acknowledged were at rest measurable by aesthetic co ordinates alone in the autonomy of their curves and angles and in these men in the thick of whom swann now found himself packed there was nothing even to the monocle which many of them wore and which previously would at the most have enabled swann to say that so and so wore a monocle which no longer restricted to the general connotation of a habit the same in all of them did not now strike him with a sense of individuality in each perhaps because he did not regard general de froberville and the marquis de bréaute who were talking together just inside the door as anything more than two figures in a picture whereas they were the old and useful friends who had put him up for the jockey club and had supported him in duels the general's monocle stuck like a shell splinter in his common scarred victorious overbearing face in the middle of a forehead which it left half blinded like the single eyed flashing front of the cyclops appeared to swann as a monstrous wound which it might have been glorious to receive but which it was certainly not decent to expose while that which m de bréaute wore as a festive badge with his pearl grey gloves his crush hat and white tie substituting it for the familiar pair of glasses as swann himself did when he went out to places bore glued to its other side like a specimen prepared on a slide for the microscope an infinitesimal gaze that swarmed with friendly feeling and never ceased to twinkle at the loftiness of ceilings the delightfulness of parties the interestingness of programmes and the excellence of refreshments hallo you here why it's ages since i've seen you the general greeted swann and noticing the look of strain on his face and concluding that it was perhaps a serious illness that had kept him away went on you're looking well old man while m de bréauté turned with my dear fellow what on earth are you doing here to a 'society novelist' who had just fitted into the angle of eyebrow and cheek his own monocle the sole instrument that he used in his psychological investigations and remorseless analyses of character and who now replied with an air of mystery and importance rolling the 'r' i am observing the marquis de forestelle's monocle was minute and rimless and by enforcing an incessant and painful contraction of the eye over which it was incrusted like a superfluous cartilage the presence of which there was inexplicable and its substance unimaginable it gave to his face a melancholy refinement and led women to suppose him capable of suffering terribly when in love but that of m de saint candé girdled like saturn with an enormous ring was the centre of gravity of a face which composed itself afresh every moment in relation to the glass while his thrusting red nose and swollen sarcastic lips endeavoured by their grimaces to rise to the level of the steady flame of wit that sparkled in the polished disk and saw itself preferred to the most ravishing eyes in the world by the smart depraved young women whom it set dreaming of artificial charms and a refinement of sensual bliss and then behind him m de palancy who with his huge carp's head and goggling eyes moved slowly up and down the stream of festive gatherings unlocking his great mandibles at every moment as though in search of his orientation had the air of carrying about upon his person only an accidental and perhaps purely symbolical fragment of the glass wall of his aquarium a part intended to suggest the whole which recalled to swann a fervent admirer of giotto's vices and virtues at padua that injustice by whose side a leafy bough evokes the idea of the forests that enshroud his secret lair swann had gone forward into the room under pressure from mme de saint euverte and in order to listen to an aria from orfeo which was being rendered on the flute and had taken up a position in a corner from which unfortunately his horizon was bounded by two ladies of 'uncertain' age seated side by side the marquise de cambremer and the vicomtesse de franquetot who because they were cousins used to spend their time at parties in wandering through the rooms each clutching her bag and followed by her daughter hunting for one another like people at a railway station and could never be at rest until they had reserved by marking them with their fans or handkerchiefs two adjacent chairs mme de cambremer since she knew scarcely anyone being all the more glad of a companion while mme de franquetot who on the contrary was extremely popular thought it effective and original to shew all her fine friends that she preferred to their company that of an obscure country cousin with whom she had childish memories in common filled with ironical melancholy swann watched them as they listened to the pianoforte intermezzo liszt's 'saint francis preaching to the birds' which came after the flute and followed the virtuoso in his dizzy flight mme de franquetot anxiously her eyes starting from her head as though the keys over which his fingers skipped with such agility were a series of trapezes from any one of which he might come crashing a hundred feet to the ground stealing now and then a glance of astonishment and unbelief at her companion as who should say it isn't possible i would never have believed that a human being could do all that mme de cambremer as a woman who had received a sound musical education beating time with her head transformed for the nonce into the pendulum of a metronome the sweep and rapidity of whose movements from one shoulder to the other performed with that look of wild abandonment in her eye which a sufferer shews who is no longer able to analyse his pain nor anxious to master it and says merely i can't help it so increased that at every moment her diamond earrings caught in the trimming of her bodice and she was obliged to put straight the bunch of black grapes which she had in her hair though without any interruption of her constantly accelerated motion on the other side and a little way in front of mme de franquetot was the marquise de gallardon absorbed in her favourite meditation namely upon her own kinship with the guermantes family from which she derived both publicly and in private a good deal of glory not unmingled with shame the most brilliant ornaments of that house remaining somewhat aloof from her perhaps because she was just a tiresome old woman or because she was a scandalous old woman or because she came of an inferior branch of the family or very possibly for no reason at all when she found herself seated next to some one whom she did not know as she was at this moment next to mme de franquetot she suffered acutely from the feeling that her own consciousness of her guermantes connection could not be made externally manifest in visible character like those which in the mosaics in byzantine churches placed one beneath another inscribe in a vertical column by the side of some sacred personage the words which he is supposed to be uttering at this moment she was pondering the fact that she had never received an invitation or even call from her young cousin the princesse des laumes during the six years that had already elapsed since the latter's marriage the thought filled her with anger and with pride for by virtue of having told everyone who expressed surprise at never seeing her at mme des laumes's that it was because of the risk of meeting the princesse mathilde there a degradation which her own family the truest and bluest of legitimists would never have forgiven her she had come gradually to believe that this actually was the reason for her not visiting her young cousin she remembered it is true that she had several times inquired of mme des laumes how they might contrive to meet but she remembered it only in a confused way and besides did more than neutralise this slightly humiliating reminiscence by murmuring after all it isn't for me to take the first step i am at least twenty years older than she is and fortified by these unspoken words she flung her shoulders proudly back until they seemed to part company with her bust while her head which lay almost horizontally upon them made one think of the 'stuck on' head of a pheasant which is brought to the table regally adorned with its feathers not that she in the least degree resembled a pheasant having been endowed by nature with a short and squat and masculine figure but successive mortifications had given her a backward tilt such as one may observe in trees which have taken root on the very edge of a precipice and are forced to grow backwards to preserve their balance since she was obliged in order to console herself for not being quite on a level with the rest of the guermantes to repeat to herself incessantly that it was owing to the uncompromising rigidity of her principles and pride that she saw so little of them the constant iteration had gradually remoulded her body and had given her a sort of 'bearing' which was accepted by the plebeian as a sign of breeding and even kindled at times a momentary spark in the jaded eyes of old gentlemen in clubs had anyone subjected mme de gallardon's conversation to that form of analysis which by noting the relative frequency of its several terms would furnish him with the key to a ciphered message he would at once have remarked that no expression not even the commonest forms of speech occurred in it nearly so often as at my cousins the guermantes's at my aunt guermantes's elzéar de guermantes's health my cousin guermantes's box if anyone spoke to her of a distinguished personage she would reply that although she was not personally acquainted with him she had seen him hundreds of times at her aunt guermantes's but she would utter this reply in so icy a tone with such a hollow sound that it was at once quite clear that if she did not know the celebrity personally that was because of all the obstinate ineradicable principles against which her arching shoulders were stretched back to rest as on one of those ladders on which gymnastic instructors make us 'extend' so as to develop the expansion of our chests at this moment the princesse des laumes who had not been expected to appear at mme de saint euverte's that evening did in fact arrive to shew that she did not wish any special attention in a house to which she had come by an act of condescension to be paid to her superior rank she had entered the room with her arms pressed close to her sides even when there was no crowd to be squeezed through no one attempting to get past her staying purposely at the back with the air of being in her proper place like a king who stands in the waiting procession at the doors of a theatre where the management have not been warned of his coming and strictly limiting her field of vision so as not to seem to be advertising her presence and claiming the consideration that was her due to the study of a pattern in the carpet or of her own skirt she stood there on the spot which had struck her as the most modest and from which as she very well knew a cry of rapture from mme de saint euverte would extricate her as soon as her presence there was noticed next to mme de cambremer whom however she did not know she observed the dumb show by which her neighbour was expressing her passion for music but she refrained from copying it this was not to say that for once that she had consented to spend a few minutes in mme de saint euverte's house the princesse des laumes would not have wished so that the act of politeness to her hostess which she had performed by coming might so to speak 'count double' to shew herself as friendly and obliging as possible but she had a natural horror of what she called 'exaggerating ' and always made a point of letting people see that she 'simply must not' indulge in any display of emotion that was not in keeping with the tone of the circle in which she moved although such displays never failed to make an impression upon her by virtue of that spirit of imitation akin to timidity which is developed in the most self confident persons by contact with an unfamiliar environment even though it be inferior to their own she began to ask herself whether these gesticulations might not perhaps be a necessary concomitant of the piece of music that was being played a piece which it might be was in a different category from all the music that she had ever heard before and whether to abstain from them was not a sign of her own inability to understand the music and of discourtesy towards the lady of the house with the result that in order to express by a compromise both of her contradictory inclinations in turn at one moment she would merely straighten her shoulder straps or feel in her golden hair for the little balls of coral or of pink enamel frosted with tiny diamonds which formed its simple but effective ornament studying with a cold interest her impassioned neighbour while at another she would beat time for a few bars with her fan but so as not to forfeit her independence she would beat a different time from the pianist's when he had finished the liszt intermezzo and had begun a prelude by chopin mme de cambremer turned to mme de franquetot with a tender smile full of intimate reminiscence as well as of satisfaction that of a competent judge with the performance she had been taught in her girlhood to fondle and cherish those long necked sinuous creatures the phrases of chopin so free so flexible so tactile which begin by seeking their ultimate resting place somewhere beyond and far wide of the direction in which they started the point which one might have expected them to reach phrases which divert themselves in those fantastic bypaths only to return more deliberately with a more premeditated reaction with more precision as on a crystal bowl which if you strike it will ring and throb until you cry aloud in anguish to clutch at one's heart brought up in a provincial household with few friends or visitors hardly ever invited to a ball she had fuddled her mind in the solitude of her old manor house over setting the pace now crawling slow now passionate whirling breathless for all those imaginary waltzing couples gathering them like flowers leaving the ball room for a moment to listen where the wind sighed among the pine trees on the shore of the lake and seeing of a sudden advancing towards her more different from anything one had ever dreamed of than earthly lovers are a slender young man whose voice was resonant and strange and false in white gloves but nowadays the old fashioned beauty of this music seemed to have become a trifle stale having forfeited some years back the esteem of 'really musical' people it had lost its distinction and its charm and even those whose taste was frankly bad had ceased to find in it more than a moderate pleasure to which they hardly liked to confess mme de cambremer cast a furtive glance behind her she knew that her young daughter in law full of respect for her new and noble family except in such matters as related to the intellect upon which having 'got as far' as harmony and the greek alphabet she was specially enlightened despised chopin and fell quite ill when she heard him played but finding herself free from the scrutiny of this wagnerian who was sitting at some distance in a group of her own contemporaries mme de cambremer let herself drift upon a stream of exquisite memories and sensations the princesse des laumes was touched also though without any natural gift for music she had received some fifteen years earlier the instruction which a music mistress of the faubourg saint germain a woman of genius who had been towards the end of her life reduced to penury had started at seventy to give to the daughters and granddaughters of her old pupils this lady was now dead but her method an echo of her charming touch came to life now and then in the fingers of her pupils even of those who had been in other respects quite mediocre had given up music and hardly ever opened a piano and so mme des laumes could let her head sway to and fro fully aware of the cause with a perfect appreciation of the manner in which the pianist was rendering this prelude since she knew it by heart the closing notes of the phrase that he had begun sounded already on her lips and she murmured how charming it is with a stress on the opening consonants of the adjective a token of her refinement by which she felt her lips so romantically compressed like the petals of a beautiful budding flower that she instinctively brought her eyes into harmony illuminating them for a moment with a vague and sentimental gaze meanwhile mme de gallardon had arrived at the point of saying to herself how annoying it was that she had so few opportunities of meeting the princesse des laumes for she meant to teach her a lesson by not acknowledging her bow she did not know that her cousin was in the room a movement of mme franquetot's head disclosed the princess at once mme de gallardon dashed towards her upsetting all her neighbours although determined to preserve a distant and glacial manner which should remind everyone present that she had no desire to remain on friendly terms with a person in whose house one might find oneself any day cheek by jowl with the princesse mathilde and to whom it was not her duty to make advances since she was not 'of her generation ' she felt bound to modify this air of dignity and reserve by some non committal remark which would justify her overture and would force the princess to engage in conversation and so when she reached her cousin mme de gallardon with a stern countenance and one hand thrust out as though she were trying to 'force' a card began with how is your husband in the same anxious tone that she would have used if the prince had been seriously ill the princess breaking into a laugh which was one of her characteristics and was intended at once to shew the rest of an assembly that she was making fun of some one and also to enhance her own beauty by concentrating her features around her animated lips and sparkling eyes answered why he's never been better in his life and she went on laughing mme de gallardon then drew herself up and chilling her expression still further perhaps because she was still uneasy about the prince's health said to her cousin oriane at once mme des laumes looked with amused astonishment towards an invisible third whom she seemed to call to witness that she had never authorised mme de gallardon to use her christian name i should be so pleased if you would look in just for a minute to morrow evening to hear a quintet with the clarinet by mozart i should like to have your opinion of it she seemed not so much to be issuing an invitation as to be asking favour and to want the princess's opinion of the mozart quintet just though it had been a dish invented by a new cook whose talent it was most important that an epicure should come to judge but i know that quintet quite well i can tell you now that i adore it you know my husband isn't at all well it's his liver he would like so much to see you mme de gallardon resumed making it now a corporal work of charity for the princess to appear at her party the princess never liked to tell people that she would not go to their houses every day she would write to express her regret at having been kept away by the sudden arrival of her husband's mother by an invitation from his brother by the opera by some excursion to the country from some party to which she had never for a moment dreamed of going in this way she gave many people the satisfaction of feeling that she was on intimate terms with them that she would gladly have come to their houses and that she had been prevented from doing so only by some princely occurrence which they were flattered to find competing with their own humble entertainment and then as she belonged to that witty 'guermantes set' in which there survived something of the alert mentality stripped of all commonplace phrases and conventional sentiments which dated from mérimée and found its final expression in the plays of meilhac and halévy she adapted its formula so as to suit even her social engagements transposed it into the courtesy which was always struggling to be positive and precise to approximate itself to the plain truth she would never develop at any length to a hostess the expression of her anxiety to be present at her party she found it more pleasant to disclose to her all the various little incidents on which it would depend whether it was or was not possible for her to come listen and i'll explain she began to mme de gallardon to morrow evening i must go to a friend of mine who has been pestering me to fix a day for ages if she takes us to the theatre afterwards then i can't possibly come to you much as i should love to but if we just stay in the house i know there won't be anyone else there so i can slip away tell me have you seen your friend m swann no my precious charles i never knew he was here where is he i must catch his eye it's a funny thing that he should come to old saint euverte's mme de gallardon went on oh i know he's very clever meaning by that 'very cunning ' but that makes no difference fancy a jew here and she the sister and sister in law of two archbishops i am ashamed to confess that i am not in the least shocked said the princesse des laumes i know he's a converted jew and all that and his parents and grandparents before him but they do say that the converted ones are worse about their religion than the practising ones that it's all just a pretence is that true d'you think i can throw no light at all on the matter the pianist who was 'down' to play two pieces by chopin after finishing the prelude had at once attacked a polonaise but once mme de gallardon had informed her cousin that swann was in the room chopin himself might have risen from the grave and played all his works in turn without mme des laumes's paying him the slightest attention she belonged to that one of the two divisions of the human race in which the untiring curiosity which the other half feels about the people whom it does not know is replaced by an unfailing interest in the people whom it does as with many women of the faubourg saint germain the presence in any room in which she might find herself of another member of her set even although she had nothing in particular to say to him would occupy her mind to the exclusion of every other consideration from that moment in the hope that swann would catch sight of her the princess could do nothing but like a tame white mouse when a lump of sugar is put down before its nose and then taken away turn her face in which were crowded a thousand signs of intimate connivance none of them with the least relevance to the sentiment underlying chopin's music in the direction where swann was and if he moved divert accordingly the course of her magnetic smile oriane don't be angry with me resumed mme de gallardon who could never restrain herself from sacrificing her highest social ambitions and the hope that she might one day emerge into a light that would dazzle the world to the immediate and secret satisfaction of saying something disagreeable people do say about your m swann that he's the sort of man one can't have in the house is that true why you of all people ought to know that it's true replied the princesse des laumes for you must have asked him a hundred times and he's never been to your house once and leaving her cousin mortified afresh she broke out again into a laugh which scandalised everyone who was trying to listen to the music but attracted the attention of mme de saint euverte who had stayed out of politeness near the piano and caught sight of the princess now for the first time mme de saint euverte was all the more delighted to see mme des laumes as she imagined her to be still at guermantes looking after her father in law who was ill my dear princess you here yes i tucked myself away in a corner and i've been hearing such lovely things what you've been in the room quite a time oh yes quite a long time which seemed very short it was only long because i couldn't see you mme de saint euverte offered her own chair to the princess who declined it with oh please no why should you it doesn't matter in the least where i sit and deliberately picking out so as the better to display the simplicity of a really great lady a low seat without a back there now that hassock that's all i want it will make me keep my back straight oh good heavens i'm making a noise again they'll be telling you to have me 'chucked out' meanwhile the pianist having doubled his speed the emotion of the music lovers was reaching its climax a servant was handing refreshments about on a salver and was making the spoons rattle and as on every other 'party night' mme de saint euverte was making signs to him which he never saw to leave the room a recent bride who had been told that a young woman ought never to appear bored was smiling vigorously trying to catch her hostess's eye so as to flash a token of her gratitude for the other's having 'thought of her' in connection with so delightful an entertainment and yet although she remained more calm than mme de franquetot it was not without some uneasiness that she followed the flying fingers what alarmed her being not the pianist's fate but the piano's on which a lighted candle jumping at each fortissimo threatened if not to set its shade on fire at least to spill wax upon the ebony at last she could contain herself no longer and running up the two steps of the platform on which the piano stood flung herself on the candle to adjust its sconce but scarcely had her hand come within reach of it when on a final chord the piece finished and the pianist rose to his feet nevertheless the bold initiative shewn by this young woman and the moment of blushing confusion between her and the pianist which resulted from it produced an impression that was favourable on the whole did you see what that girl did just now princess asked general de froberville who had come up to mme des laumes as her hostess left her for a moment odd wasn't it is she one of the performers no she's a little mme de cambremer replied the princess carelessly and then with more animation i am only repeating what i heard just now myself i haven't the faintest notion who said it it was some one behind me who said that they were neighbours of mme de saint euverte in the country but i don't believe anyone knows them really they must be 'country cousins' by the way i don't know whether you're particularly 'well up' in the brilliant society which we see before us because i've no idea who all these astonishing people can be what do you suppose they do with themselves when they're not at mme de saint euverte's parties she must have ordered them in with the musicians and the chairs and the food 'universal providers ' you know you must admit they're rather splendid general but can she really have the courage to hire the same 'supers' every week it isn't possible oh but cambremer is quite a good name old too protested the general i see no objection to its being old the princess answered dryly but whatever else it is it's not euphonious she went on isolating the word euphonious as though between inverted commas a little affectation to which the guermantes set were addicted you think not eh she's a regular little peach though said the general whose eyes never strayed from mme de cambremer don't you agree with me princess she thrusts herself forward too much i think in so young a woman that's not very nice for i don't suppose she's my generation replied mme des laumes the last word being common it appeared to gallardon and guermantes and then seeing that m de froberville was still gazing at mme de cambremer she added half out of malice towards the lady half wishing to oblige the general not very nice for her husband i am sorry that i do not know her since she seems to attract you so much i might have introduced you to her said the princess who if she had known the young woman would most probably have done nothing of the sort and now i must say good night because one of my friends is having a birthday party and i must go and wish her many happy returns she explained modestly and with truth reducing the fashionable gathering to which she was going to the simple proportions of a ceremony which would be boring in the extreme but at which she was obliged to be present and there would be something touching about her appearance besides i must pick up basin while i've been here he's gone to see those friends of his you know them too i'm sure who are called after a bridge oh yes the iénas it was a battle before it was a bridge princess it was a victory said the general i mean to say to an old soldier like me he went on wiping his monocle and replacing it as though he were laying a fresh dressing on the raw wound underneath while the princess instinctively looked away that empire nobility well of course it's not the same thing but after all taking it as it is it's very fine of its kind they were people who really did fight like heroes but i have the deepest respect for heroes the princess assented though with a faint trace of irony if i don't go with basin to see this princesse d'iéna it isn't for that at all it's simply because i don't know them basin knows them he worships them oh no it's not what you think he's not in love with her i've nothing to set my face against besides what good has it ever done when i have set my face against them she queried sadly for the whole world knew that ever since the day upon which the prince des laumes had married his fascinating cousin he had been consistently unfaithful to her anyhow it isn't that at all they're people he has known for ever so long they do him very well and that suits me down to the ground but i must tell you what he's told me about their house it's quite enough can you imagine it all their furniture is 'empire' but my dear princess that's only natural it belonged to their grandparents i don't quite say it didn't but that doesn't make it any less ugly i quite understand that people can't always have nice things but at least they needn't have things that are merely grotesque what do you say i can think of nothing more devastating more utterly smug than that hideous style cabinets covered all over with swans' heads like bath taps but i believe all the same that they've got some lovely things why they must have that famous mosaic table on which the treaty of oh i don't deny they may have things that are interesting enough from the historic point of view but things like that can't ever be beautiful because they're simply horrible i've got things like that myself that came to basin from the montesquious only they're up in the attics at guermantes where nobody ever sees them but after all that's not the point i would fly to see them with basin i would even go to see them among all their sphinxes and brasses if i knew them but i don't know them d'you know i was always taught when i was a little girl that it was not polite to call on people one didn't know she assumed a tone of childish gravity and so i am just doing what i was taught to do can't you see those good people with a totally strange woman bursting into their house why i might get a most hostile reception and she coquettishly enhanced the charm of the smile which the idea had brought to her lips by giving to her blue eyes which were fixed on the general a gentle dreamy expression my dear princess you know that they'd be simply wild with joy no why she inquired with the utmost vivacity either so as to seem unaware that it would be because she was one of the first ladies in france or so as to have the pleasure of hearing the general tell her so why how can you tell perhaps they would think it the most unpleasant thing that could possibly happen i know nothing about them but if they're anything like me i find it quite boring enough to see the people i do know i'm sure if i had to see people i didn't know as well even if they had 'fought like heroes ' i should go stark mad besides except when it's an old friend like you whom one knows quite apart from that i'm not sure that 'heroism' takes one very far in society it's often quite boring enough to have to give a dinner party but if one had to offer one's arm to spartacus to let him take one down really no it would never be vercingetorix i should send for to make a fourteenth i feel sure i should keep him for really big 'crushes ' and as i never give any ah princess it's easy to see you're not a guermantes for nothing you have your share of it all right the 'wit of the guermantes' but people always talk about the wit of the guermantes i never could make out why do you really know any others who have it she rallied him with a rippling flow of laughter her features concentrated yoked to the service of her animation her eyes sparkling blazing with a radiant sunshine of gaiety which could be kindled only by such speeches even if the princess had to make them herself as were in praise of her wit or of her beauty look there's swann talking to your cambremer woman over there beside old saint euverte don't you see him ask him to introduce you but hurry up he seems to be just going did you notice how dreadfully ill he's looking asked the general my precious charles ah he's coming at last i was beginning to think he didn't want to see me swann was extremely fond of the princesse des laumes and the sight of her recalled to him guermantes a property close to combray and all that country which he so dearly loved and had ceased to visit so as not to be separated from odette slipping into the manner half artistic half amorous with which he could always manage to amuse the princess a manner which came to him quite naturally whenever he dipped for a moment into the old social atmosphere and wishing also to express in words for his own satisfaction the longing that he felt for the country ah he exclaimed or rather intoned in such a way as to be audible at once to mme de saint euverte to whom he spoke and to mme des laumes for whom he was speaking behold our charming princess see she has come up on purpose from guermantes to hear saint francis preach to the birds and has only just had time like a dear little tit mouse to go and pick a few little hips and haws and put them in her hair there are even some drops of dew upon them still a little of the hoar frost which must be making the duchess down there shiver it is very pretty indeed my dear princess what the princess came up on purpose from guermantes but that's too wonderful i never knew i'm quite bewildered mme de saint euverte protested with quaint simplicity being but little accustomed to swann's way of speaking and then examining the princess's headdress why you're quite right it is copied from what shall i say not chestnuts no oh it's a delightful idea but how can the princess have known what was going to be on my programme the musicians didn't tell me even swann who was accustomed when he was with a woman whom he had kept up the habit of addressing in terms of gallantry to pay her delicate compliments which most other people would not and need not understand did not condescend to explain to mme de saint euverte that he had been speaking metaphorically as for the princess she was in fits of laughter both because swann's wit was highly appreciated by her set and because she could never hear a compliment addressed to herself without finding it exquisitely subtle and irresistibly amusing indeed i'm delighted charles if my little hips and haws meet with your approval but tell me why did you bow to that cambremer person are you also her neighbour in the country mme de saint euverte seeing that the princess seemed quite happy talking to swann had drifted away but you are yourself princess i why they must have 'countries' everywhere those creatures don't i wish i had no not the cambremers her own people she was a legrandin and used to come to combray i don't know whether you are aware that you are comtesse de combray and that the chapter owes you a due i don't know what the chapter owes me but i do know that i'm 'touched' for a hundred francs every year by the curé which is a due that i could very well do without but surely these cambremers have rather a startling name it ends just in time but it ends badly she said with a laugh it begins no better swann took the point yes that double abbreviation some one very angry and very proper who didn't dare to finish the first word but since he couldn't stop himself beginning the second he'd have done better to finish the first and be done with it we are indulging in the most refined form of humour my dear charles in the very best of taste but how tiresome it is that i never see you now she went on in a coaxing tone i do so love talking to you just imagine i could not make that idiot froberville see that there was anything funny about the name cambremer do agree that life is a dreadful business it's only when i see you that i stop feeling bored which was probably not true but swann and the princess had the same way of looking at the little things of life the effect if not the cause of which was a close analogy between their modes of expression and even of pronunciation this similarity was not striking because no two things could have been more unlike than their voices but if one took the trouble to imagine swann's utterances divested of the sonority that enwrapped them of the moustache from under which they emerged one found that they were the same phrases the same inflexions that they had the 'tone' of the guermantes set on important matters swann and the princess had not an idea in common but since swann had become so melancholy and was always in that trembling condition which precedes a flood of tears he had the same need to speak about his grief that a murderer has to tell some one about his crime and when he heard the princess say that life was a dreadful business he felt as much comforted as if she had spoken to him of odette yes life is a dreadful business we must meet more often my dear friend what is so nice about you is that you are not cheerful we could spend a most pleasant evening together i'm sure we could why not come down to guermantes my mother in law would be wild with joy it's supposed to be very ugly down there but i must say i find the neighborhood not at all unattractive i have a horror of 'picturesque spots' i know it well it's delightful replied swann it's almost too beautiful too much alive for me just at present it's a country to be happy in it's perhaps because i have lived there but things there speak to me so as soon as a breath of wind gets up and the cornfields begin to stir i feel that some one is going to appear suddenly that i am going to hear some news and those little houses by the water's edge i should be quite wretched oh my dearest charles do take care there's that appalling rampillon woman she's seen me hide me somewhere do tell me again quickly what it was that happened to her i get so mixed up she's just married off her daughter or her lover i never can remember perhaps both to each other oh no i remember now she's been dropped by her prince pretend to be talking so that the poor old berenice sha'n't come and invite me to dinner anyhow i'm going listen my dearest charles now that i have seen you once in a blue moon won't you let me carry you off and take you to the princesse de parme's who would be so pleased to see you you know and basin too for that matter he's meeting me there if one didn't get news of you sometimes from mémé remember i never see you at all now swann declined having told m de charlus that on leaving mme de saint euverte's he would go straight home he did not care to run the risk by going on now to the princesse de parme's of missing a message which he had all the time been hoping to see brought in to him by one of the footmen during the party and which he was perhaps going to find left with his own porter at home poor swann said mme des laumes that night to her husband he is always charming but he does look so dreadfully unhappy you will see for yourself for he has promised to dine with us one of these days i do feel that it's really absurd that a man of his intelligence should let himself be made to suffer by a creature of that kind who isn't even interesting for they tell me she's an absolute idiot she concluded with the wisdom invariably shewn by people who not being in love themselves feel that a clever man ought to be unhappy only about such persons as are worth his while which is rather like being astonished that anyone should condescend to die of cholera at the bidding of so insignificant a creature as the common bacillus swann now wished to go home but just as he was making his escape general de froberville caught him and asked for an introduction to mme de cambremer and he was obliged to go back into the room to look for her i say swann i'd rather be married to that little woman than killed by savages what do you say the words 'killed by savages' pierced swann's aching heart and at once he felt the need of continuing the conversation ah he began some fine lives have been lost in that way there was you remember that explorer whose remains dumont d'urville brought back la pérouse and he was at once happy again as though he had named odette he was a fine character and interests me very much does la pérouse he ended sadly oh yes of course la pérouse said the general it's quite a well known name there's a street called that do you know anyone in the rue la pérouse asked swann excitedly only mme de chanlivault the sister of that good fellow chaussepierre she gave a most amusing theatre party the other evening that's a house that will be really smart some day you'll see oh so she lives in the rue la pérouse it's attractive i like that street it's so sombre indeed it isn't you can't have been in it for a long time it's not at all sombre now they're beginning to build all round there when swann did finally introduce m de froberville to the young mme de cambremer since it was the first time that she had heard the general's name she hastily outlined upon her lips the smile of joy and surprise with which she would have greeted him if she had never in the whole of her life heard anything else for as she did not yet know all the friends of her new family whenever anyone was presented to her she assumed that he must be one of them and thinking that she would shew her tact by appearing to have heard 'such a lot about him' since her marriage she would hold out her hand with an air of hesitation which was meant as a proof at once of the inculcated reserve which she had to overcome and of the spontaneous friendliness which successfully overcame it and so her parents in law whom she still regarded as the most eminent pair in france declared that she was an angel all the more that they preferred to appear in marrying her to their son to have yielded to the attraction rather of her natural charm than of her considerable fortune it's easy to see that you're a musician heart and soul madame said the general alluding to the incident of the candle meanwhile the concert had begun again and swann saw that he could not now go before the end of the new number he suffered greatly from being shut up among all these people whose stupidity and absurdities wounded him all the more cruelly since being ignorant of his love incapable had they known of it of taking any interest or of doing more than smile at it as at some childish joke or deplore it as an act of insanity they made it appear to him in the aspect of a subjective state which existed for himself alone whose reality there was nothing external to confirm he suffered overwhelmingly to the point at which even the sound of the instruments made him want to cry from having to prolong his exile in this place to which odette would never come in which no one nothing was aware of her existence from which she was entirely absent but suddenly it was as though she had entered and this apparition tore him with such anguish that his hand rose impulsively to his heart what had happened was that the violin had risen to a series of high notes on which it rested as though expecting something an expectancy which it prolonged without ceasing to hold on to the notes in the exaltation with which it already saw the expected object approaching and with a desperate effort to continue until its arrival to welcome it before itself expired to keep the way open for a moment longer with all its remaining strength that the stranger might enter in as one holds a door open that would otherwise automatically close and before swann had had time to understand what was happening to think it is the little phrase from vinteuil's sonata i mustn't listen all his memories of the days when odette had been in love with him which he had succeeded up till that evening in keeping invisible in the depths of his being deceived by this sudden reflection of a season of love whose sun they supposed had dawned again had awakened from their slumber had taken wing and risen to sing maddeningly in his ears without pity for his present desolation the forgotten strains of happiness in place of the abstract expressions the time when i was happy the time when i was loved which he had often used until then and without much suffering for his intelligence had not embodied in them anything of the past save fictitious extracts which preserved none of the reality he now recovered everything that had fixed unalterably the peculiar volatile essence of that lost happiness he could see it all the snowy curled petals of the chrysanthemum which she had tossed after him into his carriage which he had kept pressed to his lips the address 'maison dorée ' embossed on the note paper on which he had read my hand trembles so as i write to you the frowning contraction of her eyebrows when she said pleadingly you won't let it be very long before you send for me he could smell the heated iron of the barber whom he used to have in to singe his hair while loredan went to fetch the little working girl could feel the torrents of rain which fell so often that spring the ice cold homeward drive in his victoria by moonlight all the network of mental habits of seasonable impressions of sensory reactions which had extended over a series of weeks its uniform meshes by which his body now found itself inextricably held at that time he had been satisfying a sensual curiosity to know what were the pleasures of those people who lived for love alone he had supposed that he could stop there that he would not be obliged to learn their sorrows also how small a thing the actual charm of odette was now in comparison with that formidable terror which extended it like a cloudy halo all around her that enormous anguish of not knowing at every hour of the day and night what she had been doing of not possessing her wholly at all times and in all places alas he recalled the accents in which she had exclaimed but i can see you at any time i am always free she who was never free now the interest the curiosity that she had shewn in his life her passionate desire that he should do her the favour of which it was he who then had felt suspicious as of a possibly tedious waste of his time and disturbance of his arrangements of granting her access to his study how she had been obliged to beg that he would let her take him to the verdurins' and when he did allow her to come to him once a month how she had first before he would let himself be swayed had to repeat what a joy it would be to her that custom of their seeing each other daily for which she had longed at a time when to him it had seemed only a tiresome distraction for which since that time she had conceived a distaste and had definitely broken herself of it while it had become for him so insatiable so dolorous a need little had he suspected how truly he spoke when on their third meeting as she repeated but why don't you let me come to you oftener he had told her laughing and in a vein of gallantry that it was for fear of forming a hopeless passion now alas it still happened at times that she wrote to him from a restaurant or hotel on paper which bore a printed address but printed in letters of fire that seared his heart written from the hôtel vouillemont what on earth can she have gone there for with whom what happened there he remembered the gas jets that were being extinguished along the boulevard des italiens when he had met her when all hope was gone among the errant shades upon that night which had seemed to him almost supernatural and which now that night of a period when he had not even to ask himself whether he would be annoying her by looking for her and by finding her so certain was he that she knew no greater happiness than to see him and to let him take her home belonged indeed to a mysterious world to which one never may return again once its doors are closed and swann could distinguish standing motionless before that scene of happiness in which it lived again a wretched figure which filled him with such pity because he did not at first recognise who it was that he must lower his head lest anyone should observe that his eyes were filled with tears it was himself when he had realised this his pity ceased he was jealous now of that other self whom she had loved he was jealous of those men of whom he had so often said without much suffering perhaps she's in love with them now that he had exchanged the vague idea of loving in which there is no love for the petals of the chrysanthemum and the 'letter heading' of the maison d'or for they were full of love and then his anguish becoming too keen he passed his hand over his forehead let the monocle drop from his eye and wiped its glass and doubtless if he had caught sight of himself at that moment he would have added to the collection of the monocles which he had already identified this one which he removed like an importunate worrying thought from his head while from its misty surface with his handkerchief he sought to obliterate his cares there are in the music of the violin if one does not see the instrument itself and so cannot relate what one hears to its form which modifies the fullness of the sound accents which are so closely akin to those of certain contralto voices that one has the illusion that a singer has taken her place amid the orchestra one raises one's eyes one sees only the wooden case magical as a chinese box but at moments one is still tricked by the deceiving appeal of the siren at times too one believes that one is listening to a captive spirit struggling in the darkness of its masterful box a box quivering with enchantment like a devil immersed in a stoup of holy water sometimes again it is in the air at large like a pure and supernatural creature that reveals to the ear as it passes its invisible message as though the musicians were not nearly so much playing the little phrase as performing the rites on which it insisted before it would consent to appear as proceeding to utter the incantations necessary to procure and to prolong for a few moments the miracle of its apparition swann who was no more able now to see it than if it had belonged to a world of ultra violet light who experienced something like the refreshing sense of a metamorphosis in the momentary blindness with which he had been struck as he approached it swann felt that it was present like a protective goddess a confidant of his love who so as to be able to come to him through the crowd and to draw him aside to speak to him had disguised herself in this sweeping cloak of sound and as she passed him light soothing as softly murmured as the perfume of a flower telling him what she had to say every word of which he closely scanned sorry to see them fly away so fast he made involuntarily with his lips the motion of kissing as it went by him the harmonious fleeting form he felt that he was no longer in exile and alone since she who addressed herself to him spoke to him in a whisper of odette for he had no longer as of old the impression that odette and he were not known to the little phrase had it not often been the witness of their joys true that as often it had warned him of their frailty and indeed whereas in that distant time he had divined an element of suffering in its smile in its limpid and disillusioned intonation to night he found there rather the charm of a resignation that was almost gay of those sorrows of which the little phrase had spoken to him then which he had seen it without his being touched by them himself carry past him smiling on its sinuous and rapid course of those sorrows which were now become his own without his having any hope of being ever delivered from them it seemed to say to him as once it had said of his happiness what does all that matter it is all nothing and swann's thoughts were borne for the first time on a wave of pity and tenderness towards that vinteuil towards that unknown exalted brother who also must have suffered so greatly what could his life have been from the depths of what well of sorrow could he have drawn that god like strength that unlimited power of creation when it was the little phrase that spoke to him of the vanity of his sufferings swann found a sweetness in that very wisdom which but a little while back had seemed to him intolerable when he thought that he could read it on the faces of indifferent strangers who would regard his love as a digression that was without importance 'twas because the little phrase unlike them whatever opinion it might hold on the short duration of these states of the soul saw in them something not as everyone else saw less serious than the events of everyday life but on the contrary so far superior to everyday life as to be alone worthy of the trouble of expressing it those graces of an intimate sorrow 'twas them that the phrase endeavoured to imitate to create anew and even their essence for all that it consists in being incommunicable and in appearing trivial to everyone save him who has experience of them the little phrase had captured had rendered visible so much so that it made their value be confessed their divine sweetness be tasted by all those same onlookers provided only that they were in any sense musical who the next moment would ignore would disown them in real life in every individual love that came into being beneath their eyes doubtless the form in which it had codified those graces could not be analysed into any logical elements but ever since more than a year before discovering to him many of the riches of his own soul the love of music had been born and for a time at least had dwelt in him swann had regarded musical motifs as actual ideas of another world of another order ideas veiled in shadows unknown impenetrable by the human mind which none the less were perfectly distinct one from another unequal among themselves in value and in significance when after that first evening at the verdurins' he had had the little phrase played over to him again and had sought to disentangle from his confused impressions how it was that like a perfume or a caress it swept over and enveloped him he had observed that it was to the closeness of the intervals between the five notes which composed it and to the constant repetition of two of them that was due that impression of a frigid a contracted sweetness but in reality he knew that he was basing this conclusion not upon the phrase itself but merely upon certain equivalents substituted for his mind's convenience for the mysterious entity of which he had become aware before ever he knew the verdurins at that earlier party when for the first time he had heard the sonata played he knew that his memory of the piano falsified still further the perspective in which he saw the music that the field open to the musician is not a miserable stave of seven notes but an immeasurable keyboard still almost all of it unknown on which here and there only separated by the gross darkness of its unexplored tracts some few among the millions of keys keys of tenderness of passion of courage of serenity which compose it each one differing from all the rest as one universe differs from another have been discovered by certain great artists who do us the service when they awaken in us the emotion corresponding to the theme which they have found of shewing us what richness what variety lies hidden unknown to us in that great black impenetrable night discouraging exploration of our soul which we have been content to regard as valueless and waste and void vinteuil had been one of those musicians in his little phrase albeit it presented to the mind's eye a clouded surface there was contained one felt a matter so consistent so explicit to which the phrase gave so new so original a force that those who had once heard it preserved the memory of it in the treasure chamber of their minds swann would repair to it as to a conception of love and happiness of which at once he knew as well in what respects it was peculiar as he would know of the princesse de clèves or of rené should either of those titles occur to him even when he was not thinking of the little phrase it existed latent in his mind in the same way as certain other conceptions without material equivalent such as our notions of light of sound of perspective of bodily desire the rich possessions wherewith our inner temple is diversified and adorned perhaps we shall lose them perhaps they will be obliterated if we return to nothing in the dust but so long as we are alive we can no more bring ourselves to a state in which we shall not have known them than we can with regard to any material object than we can for example doubt the luminosity of a lamp that has just been lighted in view of the changed aspect of everything in the room from which has vanished even the memory of the darkness in that way vinteuil's phrase like some theme say in tristan which represents to us also a certain acquisition of sentiment has espoused our mortal state had endued a vesture of humanity that was affecting enough its destiny was linked for the future with that of the human soul of which it was one of the special the most distinctive ornaments perhaps it is not being that is the true state and all our dream of life is without existence but if so we feel that it must be that these phrases of music these conceptions which exist in relation to our dream are nothing either we shall perish but we have for our hostages these divine captives who shall follow and share our fate and death in their company is something less bitter less inglorious perhaps even less certain so swann was not mistaken in believing that the phrase of the sonata did really exist human as it was from this point of view it belonged none the less to an order of supernatural creatures whom we have never seen but whom in spite of that we recognise and acclaim with rapture when some explorer of the unseen contrives to coax one forth to bring it down from that divine world to which he has access to shine for a brief moment in the firmament of ours this was what vinteuil had done for the little phrase swann felt that the composer had been content with the musical instruments at his disposal to draw aside its veil to make it visible following and respecting its outlines with a hand so loving so prudent so delicate and so sure that the sound altered at every moment blunting itself to indicate a shadow springing back into life when it must follow the curve of some more bold projection and one proof that swann was not mistaken when he believed in the real existence of this phrase was that anyone with an ear at all delicate for music would at once have detected the imposture had vinteuil endowed with less power to see and to render its forms sought to dissemble by adding a line here and there of his own invention the dimness of his vision or the feebleness of his hand the phrase had disappeared swann knew that it would come again at the end of the last movement after a long passage which mme verdurin's pianist always 'skipped ' there were in this passage some admirable ideas which swann had not distinguished on first hearing the sonata and which he now perceived as if they had in the cloakroom of his memory divested themselves of their uniform disguise of novelty swann listened to all the scattered themes which entered into the composition of the phrase as its premises enter into the inevitable conclusion of a syllogism he was assisting at the mystery of its birth audacity he exclaimed to himself as inspired perhaps as a lavoisier's or an ampere's the audacity of a vinteuil making experiment discovering the secret laws that govern an unknown force driving across a region unexplored towards the one possible goal the invisible team in which he has placed his trust and which he never may discern how charming the dialogue which swann now heard between piano and violin at the beginning of the last passage the suppression of human speech so far from letting fancy reign there uncontrolled as one might have thought had eliminated it altogether never was spoken language of such inflexible necessity never had it known questions so pertinent such obvious replies at first the piano complained alone like a bird deserted by its mate the violin heard and answered it as from a neighbouring tree it was as at the first beginning of the world as if there were not yet but these twain upon the earth or rather in this world closed against all the rest so fashioned by the logic of its creator that in it there should never be any but themselves the world of this sonata was it a bird was it the soul not yet made perfect of the little phrase was it a fairy invisibly somewhere lamenting whose plaint the piano heard and tenderly repeated its cries were so sudden that the violinist must snatch up his bow and race to catch them as they came marvellous bird the violinist seemed to wish to charm to tame to woo to win it already it had passed into his soul already the little phrase which it evoked shook like a medium's the body of the violinist 'possessed' indeed swann knew that the phrase was going to speak to him once again and his personality was now so divided that the strain of waiting for the imminent moment when he would find himself face to face once more with the phrase convulsed him in one of those sobs which a fine line of poetry or a piece of alarming news will wring from us not when we are alone but when we repeat one or the other to a friend in whom we see ourselves reflected like a third person whose probable emotion softens him it reappeared but this time to remain poised in the air and to sport there for a moment only as though immobile and shortly to expire and so swann lost nothing of the precious time for which it lingered it was still there like an iridescent bubble that floats for a while unbroken as a rainbow when its brightness fades seems to subside then soars again and before it is extinguished is glorified with greater splendour than it has ever shewn so to the two colours which the phrase had hitherto allowed to appear it added others now chords shot with every hue in the prism and made them sing swann dared not move and would have liked to compel all the other people in the room to remain still also as if the slightest movement might embarrass the magic presence supernatural delicious frail that would so easily vanish but no one as it happened dreamed of speaking the ineffable utterance of one solitary man absent perhaps dead swann did not know whether vinteuil were still alive breathed out above the rites of those two hierophants sufficed to arrest the attention of three hundred minds and made of that stage on which a soul was thus called into being one of the noblest altars on which a supernatural ceremony could be performed it followed that when the phrase at last was finished and only its fragmentary echoes floated among the subsequent themes which had already taken its place if swann at first was annoyed to see the comtesse de monteriender famed for her imbecilities lean over towards him to confide in him her impressions before even the sonata had come to an end he could not refrain from smiling and perhaps also found an underlying sense which she was incapable of perceiving in the words that she used dazzled by the virtuosity of the performers the comtesse exclaimed to swann it's astonishing i have never seen anything to beat it but a scrupulous regard for accuracy making her correct her first assertion she added the reservation anything to beat it since the table turning from that evening swann understood that the feeling which odette had once had for him would never revive that his hopes of happiness would not be realised now and the days on which by a lucky chance she had once more shewn herself kind and loving to him or if she had paid him any attention he recorded those apparent and misleading signs of a slight movement on her part towards him with the same tender and sceptical solicitude the desperate joy that people reveal who when they are nursing a friend in the last days of an incurable malady relate as significant facts of infinite value yesterday he went through his accounts himself and actually corrected a mistake that we had made in adding them up he ate an egg to day and seemed quite to enjoy it if he digests it properly we shall try him with a cutlet to morrow although they themselves know that these things are meaningless on the eve of an inevitable death no doubt swann was assured that if he had now been living at a distance from odette he would gradually have lost all interest in her so that he would have been glad to learn that she was leaving paris for ever he would have had the courage to remain there but he had not the courage to go he had often thought of going now that he was once again at work upon his essay on vermeer he wanted to return for a few days at least to the hague to dresden to brunswick he was certain that a 'toilet of diana' which had been acquired by the mauritshuis at the goldschmidt sale as a nicholas maes was in reality a vermeer and he would have liked to be able to examine the picture on the spot so as to strengthen his conviction but to leave paris while odette was there and even when she was not there for in strange places where our sensations have not been numbed by habit we refresh we revive an old pain was for him so cruel a project that he felt himself to be capable of entertaining it incessantly in his mind only because he knew himself to be resolute in his determination never to put it into effect but it would happen that while he was asleep the intention to travel would reawaken in him without his remembering that this particular tour was impossible and would be realised one night he dreamed that he was going away for a year leaning from the window of the train towards a young man on the platform who wept as he bade him farewell he was seeking to persuade this young man to come away also the train began to move he awoke in alarm and remembered that he was not going away that he would see odette that evening and next day and almost every day and then being still deeply moved by his dream he would thank heaven for those special circumstances which made him independent thanks to which he could remain in odette's vicinity and could even succeed in making her allow him to see her sometimes and counting over the list of his advantages his social position his fortune from which she stood too often in need of assistance not to shrink from the prospect of a definite rupture having even so people said an ulterior plan of getting him to marry her his friendship with m de charlus which it must be confessed had never won him any very great favour from odette but which gave him the pleasant feeling that she was always hearing complimentary things said about him by this common friend for whom she had so great an esteem and even his own intelligence the whole of which he employed in weaving every day a fresh plot which would make his presence if not agreeable at any rate necessary to odette he thought of what might have happened to him if all these advantages had been lacking he thought that if he had been like so many other men poor and humble without resources forced to undertake any task that might be offered to him or tied down by parents or by a wife he might have been obliged to part from odette that that dream the terror of which was still so recent might well have been true and he said to himself people don't know when they are happy they're never so unhappy as they think they are but he reflected that this existence had lasted already for several years that all that he could now hope for was that it should last for ever that he would sacrifice his work his pleasures his friends in fact the whole of his life to the daily expectation of a meeting which when it occurred would bring him no happiness and he asked himself whether he was not mistaken whether the circumstances that had favoured their relations and had prevented a final rupture had not done a disservice to his career whether the outcome to be desired was not that as to which he rejoiced that it happened only in dreams his own departure and he said to himself that people did not know when they were unhappy that they were never so happy as they supposed sometimes he hoped that she would die painlessly in some accident she who was out of doors in the streets crossing busy thoroughfares from morning to night and as she always returned safe and sound he marvelled at the strength at the suppleness of the human body which was able continually to hold in check to outwit all the perils that environed it which to swann seemed innumerable since his own secret desire had strewn them in her path and so allowed its occupant the soul to abandon itself day after day and almost with impunity to its career of mendacity to the pursuit of pleasure and swann felt a very cordial sympathy with that mahomet ii whose portrait by bellini he admired who on finding that he had fallen madly in love with one of his wives stabbed her in order as his venetian biographer artlessly relates to recover his spiritual freedom then he would be ashamed of thinking thus only of himself and his own sufferings would seem to deserve no pity now that he himself was disposing so cheaply of odette's very life since he was unable to separate himself from her without a subsequent return if at least he had seen her continuously and without separations his grief would ultimately have been assuaged and his love would perhaps have died and from the moment when she did not wish to leave paris for ever he had hoped that she would never go as he knew that her one prolonged absence every year was in august and september he had abundant opportunity several months in advance to dissociate from it the grim picture of her absence throughout eternity which was lodged in him by anticipation and which consisting of days closely akin to the days through which he was then passing floated in a cold transparency in his mind which it saddened and depressed though without causing him any intolerable pain but that conception of the future that flowing stream colourless and unconfined a single word from odette sufficed to penetrate through all swann's defences and like a block of ice immobilised it congealed its fluidity made it freeze altogether and swann felt himself suddenly filled with an enormous and unbreakable mass which pressed on the inner walls of his consciousness until he was fain to burst asunder for odette had said casually watching him with a malicious smile forcheville is going for a fine trip at whitsuntide he's going to egypt and swann had at once understood that this meant i am going to egypt at whitsuntide with forcheville and in fact if a few days later swann began about that trip that you told me you were going to take with forcheville she would answer carelessly yes my dear boy we're starting on the 19th we'll send you a 'view' of the pyramids then he was determined to know whether she was forcheville's mistress to ask her point blank to insist upon her telling him he knew that there were some perjuries which being so superstitious she would not commit and besides the fear which had hitherto restrained his curiosity of making odette angry if he questioned her of making himself odious had ceased to exist now that he had lost all hope of ever being loved by her one day he received an anonymous letter which told him that odette had been the mistress of countless men several of whom it named among them forcheville m de bréauté and the painter and women and that she frequented houses of ill fame he was tormented by the discovery that there was to be numbered among his friends a creature capable of sending him such a letter for certain details betrayed in the writer a familiarity with his private life he wondered who it could be but he had never had any suspicion with regard to the unknown actions of other people those which had no visible connection with what they said and when he wanted to know whether it was rather beneath the apparent character of m de charlus or of m des laumes or of m d'orsan that he must place the untravelled region in which this ignoble action might have had its birth as none of these men had ever in conversation with swann suggested that he approved of anonymous letters and as everything that they had ever said to him implied that they strongly disapproved he saw no further reason for associating this infamy with the character of any one of them more than with the rest m de charlus was somewhat inclined to eccentricity but he was fundamentally good and kind m des laumes was a trifle dry but wholesome and straight as for m d'orsan swann had never met anyone who even in the most depressing circumstances would come to him with a more heartfelt utterance would act more properly or with more discretion so much so that he was unable to understand the rather indelicate part commonly attributed to m d'orsan in his relations with a certain wealthy woman and that whenever he thought of him he was obliged to set that evil reputation on one side as irreconcilable with so many unmistakable proofs of his genuine sincerity and refinement for a moment swann felt that his mind was becoming clouded and he thought of something else so as to recover a little light until he had the courage to return to those other reflections but then after not having been able to suspect anyone he was forced to suspect everyone that he knew after all m de charlus might be most fond of him might be most good natured but he was a neuropath to morrow perhaps he would burst into tears on hearing that swann was ill and to day from jealousy or in anger or carried away by some sudden idea he might have wished to do him a deliberate injury really that kind of man was the worst of all the prince des laumes was certainly far less devoted to swann than was m de charlus but for that very reason he had not the same susceptibility with regard to him and besides his was a nature which though no doubt it was cold was as incapable of a base as of a magnanimous action swann regretted that he had formed no attachments in his life except to such people then he reflected that what prevents men from doing harm to their neighbours is fellow feeling that he could not in the last resort answer for any but men whose natures were analogous to his own as was so far as the heart went that of m de charlus the mere thought of causing swann so much distress would have been revolting to him but with a man who was insensible of another order of humanity as was the prince des laumes how was one to foresee the actions to which he might be led by the promptings of a different nature to have a good heart was everything and m de charlus had one but m d'orsan was not lacking in that either and his relations with swann cordial but scarcely intimate arising from the pleasure which as they held the same views about everything they found in talking together were more quiescent than the enthusiastic affection of m de charlus who was apt to be led into passionate activity good or evil if there was anyone by whom swann felt that he had always been understood and with delicacy loved it was m d'orsan yes but the life he led it could hardly be called honourable swann regretted that he had never taken any notice of those rumours that he himself had admitted jestingly that he had never felt so keen a sense of sympathy or of respect as when he was in thoroughly 'detrimental' society it is not for nothing he now assured himself that when people pass judgment upon their neighbour their finding is based upon his actions it is those alone that are significant and not at all what we say or what we think charlus and des laumes may have this or that fault but they are men of honour orsan perhaps has not the same faults but he is not a man of honour he may have acted dishonourably once again then he suspected rémi who it was true could only have inspired the letter but he now felt himself for a moment to be on the right track to begin with loredan had his own reasons for wishing harm to odette and then how were we not to suppose that our servants living in a situation inferior to our own adding to our fortunes and to our frailties imaginary riches and vices for which they at once envied and despised us should not find themselves led by fate to act in a manner abhorrent to people of our own class he also suspected my grandfather on every occasion when swann had asked him to do him any service had he not invariably declined besides with his ideas of middle class respectability he might have thought that he was acting for swann's good he suspected in turn bergotte the painter the verdurins paused for a moment to admire once again the wisdom of people in society who refused to mix in the artistic circles in which such things were possible were perhaps even openly avowed as excellent jokes but then he recalled the marks of honesty that were to be observed in those bohemians and contrasted them with the life of expedients often bordering on fraudulence to which the want of money the craving for luxury the corrupting influence of their pleasures often drove members of the aristocracy in a word this anonymous letter proved that he himself knew a human being capable of the most infamous conduct but he could see no reason why that infamy should lurk in the depths which no strange eye might explore of the warm heart rather than the cold the artist's rather than the business man's the noble's rather than the flunkey's what criterion ought one to adopt in order to judge one's fellows after all there was not a single one of the people whom he knew who might not in certain circumstances prove capable of a shameful action must he then cease to see them all his mind grew clouded he passed his hands two or three times across his brow wiped his glasses with his handkerchief and remembering that after all men who were as good as himself frequented the society of m de charlus the prince des laumes and the rest he persuaded himself that this meant if not that they were incapable of shameful actions at least that it was a necessity in human life to which everyone must submit to frequent the society of people who were perhaps not incapable of such actions and he continued to shake hands with all the friends whom he had suspected with the purely formal reservation that each one of them had possibly been seeking to drive him to despair as for the actual contents of the letter they did not disturb him for in not one of the charges which it formulated against odette could he see the least vestige of fact like many other men swann had a naturally lazy mind and was slow in invention he knew quite well as a general truth that human life is full of contrasts but in the case of any one human being he imagined all that part of his or her life with which he was not familiar as being identical with the part with which he was he imagined what was kept secret from him in the light of what was revealed at such times as he spent with odette if their conversation turned upon an indelicate act committed or an indelicate sentiment expressed by some third person she would ruthlessly condemn the culprit by virtue of the same moral principles which swann had always heard expressed by his own parents and to which he himself had remained loyal and then she would arrange her flowers would sip her tea would shew an interest in his work so swann extended those habits to fill the rest of her life he reconstructed those actions when he wished to form a picture of the moments in which he and she were apart if anyone had portrayed her to him as she was or rather as she had been for so long with himself but had substituted some other man he would have been distressed for such a portrait would have struck him as lifelike but to suppose that she went to bad houses that she abandoned herself to orgies with other women that she led the crapulous existence of the most abject the most contemptible of mortals would be an insane wandering of the mind for the realisation of which thank heaven the chrysanthemums that he could imagine the daily cups of tea the virtuous indignation left neither time nor place only now and again he gave odette to understand that people maliciously kept him informed of everything that she did and making opportune use of some detail insignificant but true which he had accidentally learned as though it were the sole fragment which he would allow in spite of himself to pass his lips out of the numberless other fragments of that complete reconstruction of her daily life which he carried secretly in his mind he led her to suppose that he was perfectly informed upon matters which in reality he neither knew nor suspected for if he often adjured odette never to swerve from or make alteration of the truth that was only whether he realised it or no in order that odette should tell him everything that she did no doubt as he used to assure odette he loved sincerity but only as he might love a pander who could keep him in touch with the daily life of his mistress moreover his love of sincerity not being disinterested had not improved his character the truth which he cherished was that which odette would tell him but he himself in order to extract that truth from her was not afraid to have recourse to falsehood that very falsehood which he never ceased to depict to odette as leading every human creature down to utter degradation in a word he lied as much as did odette because while more unhappy than she he was no less egotistical and she when she heard him repeating thus to her the things that she had done would stare at him with a look of distrust and at all hazards of indignation so as not to appear to be humiliated and to be blushing for her actions one day after the longest period of calm through which he had yet been able to exist without being overtaken by an attack of jealousy he had accepted an invitation to spend the evening at the theatre with the princesse des laumes having opened his newspaper to find out what was being played the sight of the title les filles de marbre by théodore barrière struck him so cruel a blow that he recoiled instinctively from it and turned his head away illuminated as though by a row of footlights in the new surroundings in which it now appeared that word 'marble ' which he had lost the power to distinguish so often had it passed in print beneath his eyes had suddenly become visible once again and had at once brought back to his mind the story which odette had told him long ago of a visit which she had paid to the salon at the palais d'industrie with mme verdurin who had said to her take care now i know how to melt you all right you're not made of marble odette had assured him that it was only a joke and he had not attached any importance to it at the time but he had had more confidence in her then than he had now and the anonymous letter referred explicitly to relations of that sort without daring to lift his eyes to the newspaper he opened it turned the page so as not to see again the words filles de marbre and began to read mechanically the news from the provinces there had been a storm in the channel and damage was reported from dieppe cabourg beuzeval suddenly he recoiled again in horror the name of beuzeval had suggested to him that of another place in the same district beuzeville which carried also bound to it by a hyphen a second name to wit bréauté which he had often seen on maps but without ever previously remarking that it was the same name as that borne by his friend m de bréauté whom the anonymous letter accused of having been odette's lover after all when it came to m de bréauté there was nothing improbable in the charge but so far as mme verdurin was concerned it was a sheer impossibility from the fact that odette did occasionally tell a lie it was not fair to conclude that she never by any chance told the truth and in these bantering conversations with mme verdurin which she herself had repeated to swann he could recognize those meaningless and dangerous pleasantries which in their inexperience of life and ignorance of vice women often utter thereby certifying their own innocence who as for instance odette would be the last people in the world to feel any undue affection for one another whereas on the other hand the indignation with which she had scattered the suspicions which she had unintentionally brought into being for a moment in his mind by her story fitted in with everything that he knew of the tastes the temperament of his mistress but at that moment by an inspiration of jealousy analogous to the inspiration which reveals to a poet or a philosopher who has nothing so far but an odd pair of rhymes or a detached observation the idea or the natural law which will give power mastery to his work swann recalled for the first time a remark which odette had made to him at least two years before oh mme verdurin she won't hear of anything just now but me i'm a 'love ' if you please and she kisses me and wants me to go with her everywhere and call her by her christian name so far from seeing in these expressions any connection with the absurd insinuations intended to create an atmosphere of vice which odette had since repeated to him he had welcomed them as a proof of mme verdurin's warm hearted and generous friendship but now this old memory of her affection for odette had coalesced suddenly with his more recent memory of her unseemly conversation he could no longer separate them in his mind and he saw them blended in reality the affection imparting a certain seriousness and importance to the pleasantries which in return spoiled the affection of its innocence he went to see odette he sat down keeping at a distance from her he did not dare to embrace her not knowing whether in her in himself it would be affection or anger that a kiss would provoke he sat there silent watching their love expire suddenly he made up his mind odette my darling he began i know i am being simply odious but i must ask you a few questions you remember what i once thought about you and mme verdurin tell me was it true have you with her or anyone else ever she shook her head pursing her lips together a sign which people commonly employ to signify that they are not going because it would bore them to go when some one has asked are you coming to watch the procession go by or will you be at the review but this shake of the head which is thus commonly used to decline participation in an event that has yet to come imparts for that reason an element of uncertainty to the denial of participation in an event that is past furthermore it suggests reasons of personal convenience rather than any definite repudiation any moral impossibility when he saw odette thus make him a sign that the insinuation was false he realised that it was quite possibly true i have told you i never did you know quite well she added seeming angry and uncomfortable yes i know all that but are you quite sure don't say to me 'you know quite well' say 'i have never done anything of that sort with any woman ' she repeated his words like a lesson learned by rote and as though she hoped thereby to be rid of him i have never done anything of that sort with any woman can you swear it to me on your laghetto medal swann knew that odette would never perjure herself on that oh you do make me so miserable she cried with a jerk of her body as though to shake herself free of the constraint of his question have you nearly done what is the matter with you to day you seem to have made up your mind that i am to be forced to hate you to curse you look i was anxious to be friends with you again for us to have a nice time together like the old days and this is all the thanks i get however he would not let her go but sat there like a surgeon who waits for a spasm to subside that has interrupted his operation but need not make him abandon it you are quite wrong in supposing that i bear you the least ill will in the world odette he began with a persuasive and deceitful gentleness i never speak to you except of what i already know and i always know a great deal more than i say but you alone can mollify by your confession what makes me hate you so long as it has been reported to me only by other people my anger with you is never due to your actions i can and do forgive you everything because i love you but to your untruthfulness the ridiculous untruthfulness which makes you persist in denying things which i know to be true how can you expect that i shall continue to love you when i see you maintain when i hear you swear to me a thing which i know to be false odette do not prolong this moment which is torturing us both if you are willing to end it at once you shall be free of it for ever tell me upon your medal yes or no whether you have ever done those things how on earth can i tell she was furious perhaps i have ever so long ago when i didn't know what i was doing perhaps two or three times swann had prepared himself for all possibilities reality must therefore be something which bears no relation to possibilities any more than the stab of a knife in one's body bears to the gradual movement of the clouds overhead since those words two or three times carved as it were a cross upon the living tissues of his heart a strange thing indeed that those words two or three times nothing more than a few words words uttered in the air at a distance could so lacerate a man's heart as if they had actually pierced it could sicken a man like a poison that he had drunk instinctively swann thought of the remark that he had heard at mme de saint euverte's i have never seen anything to beat it since the table turning the agony that he now suffered in no way resembled what he had supposed not only because in the hours when he most entirely mistrusted her he had rarely imagined such a culmination of evil but because even when he did imagine that offence it remained vague uncertain was not clothed in the particular horror which had escaped with the words perhaps two or three times was not armed with that specific cruelty as different from anything that he had known as a new malady by which one is attacked for the first time and yet this odette from whom all this evil sprang was no less dear to him was on the contrary more precious as if in proportion as his sufferings increased there increased at the same time the price of the sedative of the antidote which this woman alone possessed he wished to pay her more attention as one attends to a disease which one discovers suddenly to have grown more serious he wished that the horrible thing which she had told him she had done two or three times might be prevented from occurring again to ensure that he must watch over odette people often say that by pointing out to a man the faults of his mistress you succeed only in strengthening his attachment to her because he does not believe you yet how much more so if he does but swann asked himself how could he manage to protect her he might perhaps be able to preserve her from the contamination of any one woman but there were hundreds of other women and he realised how insane had been his ambition when he had begun on the evening when he had failed to find odette at the verdurins' to desire the possession as if that were ever possible of another person happily for swann beneath the mass of suffering which had invaded his soul like a conquering horde of barbarians there lay a natural foundation older more placid and silently laborious like the cells of an injured organ which at once set to work to repair the damaged tissues or the muscles of a paralysed limb which tend to recover their former movements these older these autochthonous in dwellers in his soul absorbed all swann's strength for a while in that obscure task of reparation which gives one an illusory sense of repose during convalescence or after an operation this time it was not so much as it ordinarily was in swann's brain that the slackening of tension due to exhaustion took effect it was rather in his heart but all the things in life that have once existed tend to recur and like a dying animal that is once more stirred by the throes of a convulsion which was apparently ended upon swann's heart spared for a moment only the same agony returned of its own accord to trace the same cross again he remembered those moonlit evenings when leaning back in the victoria that was taking him to the rue la pérouse he would cultivate with voluptuous enjoyment the emotions of a man in love ignorant of the poisoned fruit that such emotions must inevitably bear but all those thoughts lasted for no more than a second the time that it took him to raise his hand to his heart to draw breath again and to contrive to smile so as to dissemble his torment already he had begun to put further questions for his jealousy which had taken an amount of trouble such as no enemy would have incurred to strike him this mortal blow to make him forcibly acquainted with the most cruel pain that he had ever known his jealousy was not satisfied that he had yet suffered enough and sought to expose his bosom to an even deeper wound like an evil deity his jealousy was inspiring swann was thrusting him on towards destruction it was not his fault but odette's alone if at first his punishment was not more severe my darling he began again it's all over now was it with anyone i know no i swear it wasn't besides i think i exaggerated i never really went as far as that he smiled and resumed with just as you like it doesn't really matter but it's unfortunate that you can't give me any name if i were able to form an idea of the person that would prevent my ever thinking of her again i say it for your own sake because then i shouldn't bother you any more about it it's so soothing to be able to form a clear picture of things in one's mind what is really terrible is what one cannot imagine but you've been so sweet to me i don't want to tire you i do thank you with all my heart for all the good that you have done me i've quite finished now only one word more how many times oh charles can't you see you're killing me it's all ever so long ago i've never given it a thought anyone would say that you were positively trying to put those ideas into my head again and then you'd be a lot better off she concluded with unconscious stupidity but with intentional malice i only wished to know whether it had been since i knew you it's only natural did it happen here ever you can't give me any particular evening so that i can remind myself what i was doing at the time you understand surely that it's not possible that you don't remember with whom odette my love but i don't know really i don't i think it was in the bois one evening when you came to meet us on the island you had been dining with the princesse des laumes she added happy to be able to furnish him with an exact detail which testified to her veracity at the next table there was a woman whom i hadn't seen for ever so long she said to me 'come along round behind the rock there and look at the moonlight on the water ' at first i just yawned and said 'no i'm too tired and i'm quite happy where i am thank you ' she swore there'd never been anything like it in the way of moonlight 'i've heard that tale before ' i said to her you see i knew quite well what she was after odette narrated this episode almost as if it were a joke either because it appeared to her to be quite natural or because she thought that she was thereby minimising its importance or else so as not to appear ashamed but catching sight of swann's face she changed her tone and you are a fiend she flung at him you enjoy tormenting me making me tell you lies just so that you'll leave me in peace this second blow struck at swann was even more excruciating than the first never had he supposed it to have been so recent an affair hidden from his eyes that had been too innocent to discern it not in a past which he had never known but in evenings which he so well remembered which he had lived through with odette of which he had supposed himself to have such an intimate such an exhaustive knowledge and which now assumed retrospectively an aspect of cunning and deceit and cruelty in the midst of them parted suddenly a gaping chasm that moment on the island in the bois de boulogne without being intelligent odette had the charm of being natural she had recounted she had acted the little scene with so much simplicity that swann as he gasped for breath could vividly see it odette yawning the rock there he could hear her answer alas how lightheartedly i've heard that tale before he felt that she would tell him nothing more that evening that no further revelation was to be expected for the present he was silent for a time then said to her my poor darling you must forgive me i know i am hurting you dreadfully but it's all over now i shall never think of it again but she saw that his eyes remained fixed upon the things that he did not know and on that past era of their love monotonous and soothing in his memory because it was vague and now rent as with a sword wound by the news of that minute on the island in the bois by moonlight while he was dining with the princesse des laumes but he had so far acquired the habit of finding life interesting of marvelling at the strange discoveries that there were to be made in it that even while he was suffering so acutely that he did not believe it possible to endure such agony for any length of time he was saying to himself life is indeed astonishing and holds some fine surprises it appears that vice is far more common than one has been led to believe here is a woman in whom i had absolute confidence who looks so simple so honest who in any case even allowing that her morals are not strict seemed quite normal and healthy in her tastes and inclinations i receive a most improbable accusation i question her and the little that she admits reveals far more than i could ever have suspected but he could not confine himself to these detached observations he sought to form an exact estimate of the importance of what she had just told him so as to know whether he might conclude that she had done these things often and was likely to do them again he repeated her words to himself i knew quite well what she was after two or three times i've heard that tale before but they did not reappear in his memory unarmed each of them held a knife with which it stabbed him afresh for a long time like a sick man who cannot restrain himself from attempting every minute to make the movement that he knows will hurt him he kept on murmuring to himself i'm quite happy where i am thank you i've heard that tale before but the pain was so intense that he was obliged to stop he was amazed to find that actions which he had always hitherto judged so lightly had dismissed indeed with a laugh should have become as serious to him as a disease which might easily prove fatal he knew any number of women whom he could ask to keep an eye on odette but how was he to expect them to adjust themselves to his new point of view and not to remain at that which for so long had been his own which had always guided him in his voluptuous existence not to say to him with a smile you jealous monster wanting to rob other people of their pleasure by what trap door suddenly lowered had he who had never found in the old days in his love for odette any but the most refined of pleasures been precipitated into this new circle of hell from which he could not see how he was ever to escape poor odette he wished her no harm she was but half to blame had he not been told that it was her own mother who had sold her when she was still little more than a child at nice to a wealthy englishman but what an agonising truth was now contained for him in those lines of alfred de vigny's journal d'un poète which he had previously read without emotion when one feels oneself smitten by love for a woman one ought to say to oneself 'what are 'her surroundings what has been her life ' all one's future happiness lies in the answer swann was astonished that such simple phrases spelt over in his mind as i've heard that tale before or i knew quite well what she was after could cause him so much pain but he realised that what he had mistaken for simple phrases were indeed parts of the panoply which held and could inflict on him the anguish that he had felt while odette was telling her story for it was the same anguish that he now was feeling afresh it was no good his knowing now indeed it was no good as time went on his having partly forgotten and altogether forgiven the offence whenever he repeated her words his old anguish refashioned him as he had been before odette began to speak ignorant trustful his merciless jealousy placed him once again so that he might be effectively wounded by odette's admission in the position of a man who does not yet know the truth and after several months this old story would still dumbfounder him like a sudden revelation he marvelled at the terrible recreative power of his memory it was only by the weakening of that generative force whose fecundity diminishes as age creeps over one that he could hope for a relaxation of his torments but as soon as the power that any one of odette's sentences had to make swann suffer seemed to be nearly exhausted lo and behold another one of those to which he had hitherto paid least attention almost a new sentence came to relieve the first and to strike at him with undiminished force the memory of the evening on which he had dined with the princesse des laumes was painful to him but it was no more than the centre the core of his pain that radiated vaguely round about it overflowing into all the preceding and following days and on whatever point in it he might intend his memory to rest it was the whole of that season during which the verdurins had so often gone to dine upon the island in the bois that sprang back to hurt him so violently that by slow degrees the curiosity which his jealousy was ever exciting in him was neutralised by his fear of the fresh tortures which he would be inflicting upon himself were he to satisfy it he recognised that all the period of odette's life which had elapsed before she first met him a period of which he had never sought to form any picture in his mind was not the featureless abstraction which he could vaguely see but had consisted of so many definite dated years each crowded with concrete incidents but were he to learn more of them he feared lest her past now colourless fluid and supportable might assume a tangible an obscene form with individual and diabolical features and he continued to refrain from seeking a conception of it not any longer now from laziness of mind but from fear of suffering he hoped that some day he might be able to hear the island in the bois or the princesse des laumes mentioned without feeling any twinge of that old rending pain meanwhile he thought it imprudent to provoke odette into furnishing him with fresh sentences with the names of more places and people and of different events which when his malady was still scarcely healed would make it break out again in another form but often enough the things that he did not know that he dreaded now to learn it was odette herself who spontaneously and without thought of what she did revealed them to him for the gap which her vices made between her actual life and the comparatively innocent life which swann had believed and often still believed his mistress to lead was far wider than she knew a vicious person always affecting the same air of virtue before people whom he is anxious to keep from having any suspicion of his vices has no register no gauge at hand from which he may ascertain how far those vices their continuous growth being imperceptible by himself have gradually segregated him from the normal ways of life in the course of their cohabitation in odette's mind with the memory of those of her actions which she concealed from swann her other her innocuous actions were gradually coloured infected by these without her being able to detect anything strange in them without their causing any explosion in the particular region of herself in which she made them live but when she related them to swann he was overwhelmed by the revelation of the duplicity to which they pointed one day he was trying without hurting odette to discover from her whether she had ever had any dealings with procuresses he was as a matter of fact convinced that she had not the anonymous letter had put the idea into his mind but in a purely mechanical way it had been received there with no credulity but it had for all that remained there and swann wishing to be rid of the burden a dead weight but none the less disturbing of this suspicion hoped that odette would now extirpate it for ever oh dear no not that they don't simply persecute me to go to them her smile revealed a gratified vanity which she no longer saw that it was impossible should appear legitimate to swann there was one of them waited more than two hours for me yesterday said she would give me any money i asked it seems there's an ambassador who said to her 'i'll kill myself if you don't bring her to me' meaning me they told her i'd gone out but she waited and waited and in the end i had to go myself and speak to her before she'd go away i do wish you could have seen the way i tackled her my maid was in the next room listening and told me i shouted fit to bring the house down 'but when you hear me say that i don't want to the idea of such a thing i don't like it at all i should hope i'm still free to do as i please and when i please and where i please if i needed the money i could understand ' the porter has orders not to let her in again he will tell her that i am out of town oh i do wish i could have had you hidden somewhere in the room while i was talking to her i know you'd have been pleased my dear there's some good in your little odette you see after all though people do say such dreadful things about her besides her very admissions when she made any of faults which she supposed him to have discovered rather served swann as a starting point for fresh doubts than they put an end to the old for her admissions never exactly coincided with his doubts in vain might odette expurgate her confession of all its essential part there would remain in the accessories something which swann had never yet imagined which crushed him anew and was to enable him to alter the terms of the problem of his jealousy and these admissions he could never forget his spirit carried them along cast them aside then cradled them again in its bosom like corpses in a river and they poisoned it she spoke to him once of a visit that forcheville had paid her on the day of the paris murcie fête what you knew him as long ago as that oh yes of course you did he corrected himself so as not to shew that he had been ignorant of the fact and suddenly he began to tremble at the thought that on the day of the paris murcie fête when he had received that letter which he had so carefully preserved she had been having luncheon perhaps with forcheville at the maison d'or she swore that she had not still the maison d'or reminds me of something or other which i knew at the time wasn't true he pursued hoping to frighten her yes that i hadn't been there at all that evening when i told you i had just come from there and you had been looking for me at prévost's she replied judging by his manner that he knew with a firmness that was based not so much upon cynicism as upon timidity a fear of crossing swann which her own self respect made her anxious to conceal and a desire to shew him that she could be perfectly frank if she chose and so she struck him with all the sharpness and force of a headsman wielding his axe and yet could not be charged with cruelty since she was quite unconscious of hurting him she even began to laugh though this may perhaps it is true have been chiefly to keep him from thinking that she was ashamed at all or confused it's quite true i hadn't been to the maison dorée i was coming away from forcheville's i had really been to prévost's that wasn't a story and he met me there and asked me to come in and look at his prints but some one else came to see him i told you that i was coming from the maison d'or because i was afraid you might be angry with me it was rather nice of me really don't you see i admit i did wrong but at least i'm telling you all about it now a'n't i what have i to gain by not telling you straight that i lunched with him on the day of the paris murcie fête if it were true especially as at that time we didn't know one another quite so well as we do now did we dear he smiled back at her with the sudden craven weakness of the utterly spiritless creature which these crushing words had made of him and so even in the months of which he had never dared to think again because they had been too happy in those months when she had loved him she was already lying to him besides that moment that first evening on which they had done a cattleya when she had told him that she was coming from the maison dorée how many others must there have been each of them covering a falsehood of which swann had had no suspicion he recalled how she had said to him once i need only tell mme verdurin that my dress wasn't ready or that my cab came late there is always some excuse from himself too probably many times when she had glibly uttered such words as explain a delay or justify an alteration of the hour fixed for a meeting those moments must have hidden without his having the least inkling of it at the time an engagement that she had had with some other man some man to whom she had said i need only tell swann that my dress wasn't ready or that my cab came late there is always some excuse and beneath all his most pleasant memories beneath the simplest words that odette had ever spoken to him in those old days words which he had believed as though they were the words of a gospel beneath her daily actions which she had recounted to him beneath the most ordinary places her dressmaker's flat the avenue du bois the hippodrome he could feel dissembled there by virtue of that temporal superfluity which after the most detailed account of how a day has been spent always leaves something over that may serve as a hiding place for certain unconfessed actions he could feel the insinuation of a possible undercurrent of falsehood which debased for him all that had remained most precious his happiest evenings the rue la pérouse itself which odette must constantly have been leaving at other hours than those of which she told him extending the power of the dark horror that had gripped him when he had heard her admission with regard to the maison dorée and like the obscene creatures in the 'desolation of nineveh ' shattering stone by stone the whole edifice of his past if now he turned aside whenever his memory repeated the cruel name of the maison dorée it was because that name recalled to him no longer as such a little time since at mme de saint euverte's party the good fortune which he long had lost but a misfortune of which he was now first aware then it befell the maison dorée as it had befallen the island in the bois that gradually its name ceased to trouble him for what we suppose to be our love our jealousy are neither of them single continuous and individual passions they are composed of an infinity of successive loves of different jealousies each of which is ephemeral although by their uninterrupted multitude they give us the impression of continuity the illusion of unity the life of swann's love the fidelity of his jealousy were formed out of death of infidelity of innumerable desires innumerable doubts all of which had odette for their object if he had remained for any length of time without seeing her those that died would not have been replaced by others but the presence of odette continued to sow in swann's heart alternate seeds of love and suspicion on certain evenings she would suddenly resume towards him a kindness of which she would warn him sternly that he must take immediate advantage under penalty of not seeing it repeated for years to come he must instantly accompany her home to do a cattleya and the desire which she pretended to have for him was so sudden so inexplicable so imperious the kisses which she lavished on him were so demonstrative and so unfamiliar that this brutal and unnatural fondness made swann just as unhappy as any lie or unkind action one evening when he had thus in obedience to her command gone home with her and while she was interspersing her kisses with passionate words in strange contrast to her habitual coldness he thought suddenly that he heard a sound he rose searched everywhere and found nobody but he had not the courage to return to his place by her side whereupon she in a towering rage broke a vase with i never can do anything right with you you impossible person and he was left uncertain whether she had not actually had some man concealed in the room whose jealousy she had wished to wound or else to inflame his senses sometimes he repaired to 'gay' houses hoping to learn something about odette although he dared not mention her name i have a little thing here you're sure to like the 'manageress' would greet him and he would stay for an hour or so talking dolefully to some poor girl who sat there astonished that he went no further one of them who was still quite young and attractive said to him once of course what i should like would be to find a real friend then he might be quite certain i should never go with any other men again indeed do you think it possible for a woman really to be touched by a man's being in love with her and never to be unfaithful to him asked swann anxiously why surely it all depends on their characters swann could not help making the same remarks to these girls as would have delighted the princesse des laumes to the one who was in search of a friend he said with a smile but how nice of you you've put on blue eyes to go with your sash and you too you've got blue cuffs on what a charming conversation we are having for a place of this sort i'm not boring you am i or keeping you no i've nothing to do thank you if you bored me i should say so but i love hearing you talk i am highly flattered aren't we behaving prettily he asked the 'manageress ' who had just looked in why yes that's just what i was saying to myself how sensibly they're behaving but that's how it is people come to my house now just to talk the prince was telling me only the other day that he's far more comfortable here than with his wife it seems that nowadays all the society ladies are like that a perfect scandal i call it but i'll leave you in peace now i know when i'm not wanted she ended discreetly and left swann with the girl who had the blue eyes but presently he rose and said good bye to her she had ceased to interest him she did not know odette the painter having been ill dr cottard recommended a sea voyage several of the 'faithful' spoke of accompanying him the verdurins could not face the prospect of being left alone in paris so first of all hired and finally purchased a yacht thus odette was constantly going on a cruise whenever she had been away for any length of time swann would feel that he was beginning to detach himself from her but as though this moral distance were proportionate to the physical distance between them whenever he heard that odette had returned to paris he could not rest without seeing her once when they had gone away as everyone thought for a month only either they succumbed to a series of temptations or else m verdurin had cunningly arranged everything beforehand to please his wife and disclosed his plans to the 'faithful' only as time went on anyhow from algiers they flitted to tunis then to italy greece constantinople asia minor they had been absent for nearly a year and swann felt perfectly at ease and almost happy albeit m verdurin had endeavoured to persuade the pianist and dr cottard that their respective aunt and patients had no need of them and that in any event it was most rash to allow mme cottard to return to paris where mme verdurin assured him a revolution had just broken out he was obliged to grant them their liberty at constantinople and the painter came home with them one day shortly after the return of these four travellers swann seeing an omnibus approach him labelled 'luxembourg ' and having some business there had jumped on to it and had found himself sitting opposite mme cottard who was paying a round of visits to people whose 'day' it was in full review order with a plume in her hat a silk dress a muff an umbrella which do for a parasol if the rain kept off a card case and a pair of white gloves fresh from the cleaners wearing these badges of rank she would in fine weather go on foot from one house to another in the same neighbourhood but when she had to proceed to another district would make use of a transfer ticket on the omnibus for the first minute or two until the natural courtesy of the woman broke through the starched surface of the doctor's wife not being certain either whether she ought to mention the verdurins before swann she produced quite naturally in her slow and awkward but not unattractive voice which every now and then was completely drowned by the rattling of the omnibus topics selected from those which she had picked up and would repeat in each of the score of houses up the stairs of which she clambered in the course of an afternoon i needn't ask you m swann whether a man so much in the movement as yourself has been to the mirlitons to see the portrait by machard that the whole of paris is running after well and what do you think of it whose camp are you in those who bless or those who curse it's the same in every house in paris now no one will speak of anything else but machard's portrait you aren't smart you aren't really cultured you aren't up to date unless you give an opinion on machard's portrait swann having replied that he had not seen this portrait mme cottard was afraid that she might have hurt his feelings by obliging him to confess the omission oh that's quite all right at least you have the courage to be quite frank about it you don't consider yourself disgraced because you haven't seen machard's portrait i do think that so nice of you well now i have seen it opinion is divided you know there are some people who find it rather laboured like whipped cream they say but i think it's just ideal of course she's not a bit like the blue and yellow ladies that our friend biche paints that's quite clear but i must tell you perfectly frankly you'll think me dreadfully old fashioned but i always say just what i think that i don't understand his work i can quite see the good points there are in his portrait of my husband oh dear me yes and it's certainly less odd than most of what he does but even then he had to give the poor man a blue moustache but machard just listen to this now the husband of my friend i am on my way to see at this very moment which has given me the very great pleasure of your company has promised her that if he is elected to the academy he is one of the doctor's colleagues he will get machard to paint her portrait so she's got something to look forward to i have another friend who insists that she'd rather have leloir i'm only a wretched philistine and i've no doubt leloir has perhaps more knowledge of painting even than machard but i do think that the most important thing about a portrait especially when it's going to cost ten thousand francs is that it should be like and a pleasant likeness if you know what i mean having exhausted this topic to which she had been inspired by the loftiness of her plume the monogram on her card case the little number inked inside each of her gloves by the cleaner and the difficulty of speaking to swann about the verdurins mme cottard seeing that they had still a long way to go before they would reach the corner of the rue bonaparte where the conductor was to set her down listened to the promptings of her heart which counselled other words than these your ears must have been burning she ventured while we were on the yacht with mme verdurin we were talking about you all the time swann was genuinely astonished for he supposed that his name was never uttered in the verdurins' presence you see mme cottard went on mme de crécy was there need i say more when odette is anywhere it's never long before she begins talking about you and you know quite well it isn't nasty things she says what you don't believe me she went on noticing that svrann looked sceptical and carried away by the sincerity of her conviction without putting any evil meaning into the word which she used purely in the sense in which one employs it to speak of the affection that unites a pair of friends why she adores you no indeed i'm sure it would never do to say anything against you when she was about one would soon be taught one's place whatever we might be doing if we were looking at a picture for instance she would say 'if only we had him here he's the man who could tell us whether it's genuine or not there's no one like him for that ' and all day long she would be saying 'what can he be doing just now i do hope he's doing a little work it's too dreadful that a fellow with such gifts as he has should be so lazy ' forgive me won't you 'i can see him this very moment he's thinking of us he's wondering where we are ' indeed she used an expression which i thought very pretty at the time m verdurin asked her 'how in the world can you see what he's doing when he's a thousand miles away ' and odette answered 'nothing is impossible to the eye of a friend ' no i assure you i'm not saying it just to flatter you you have a true friend in her such as one doesn't often find i can tell you besides in case you don't know it that you're the only one mme verdurin told me as much herself on our last day with them one talks more freely don't you know before a parting 'i don't say that odette isn't fond of us but anything that we may say to her counts for very little beside what swann might say ' oh mercy there's the conductor stopping for me here have i been chatting away to you and would have gone right past the rue bonaparte and never noticed will you be so very kind as to tell me whether my plume is straight and mme cottard withdrew from her muff to offer it to swann a white gloved hand from which there floated with a transier ticket an atmosphere of fashionable life that pervaded the omnibus blended with the harsher fragrance of newly cleaned kid and swann felt himself overflowing with gratitude to her as well as to mme verdurin and almost to odette for the feeling that he now entertained for her was no longer tinged with pain was scarcely even to be described now as love while from the platform of the omnibus he followed her with loving eyes as she gallantly threaded her way along the rue bonaparte her plume erect her skirt held up in one hand while in the other she clasped her umbrella and her card case so that its monogram could be seen her muff dancing in the air before her as she went to compete with and so to stimulate the moribund feelings that swann had for odette mme cottard a wiser physician in this case than ever her husband would have been had grafted among them others more normal feelings of gratitude of friendship which in swann's mind were to make odette seem again more human more like other women since other women could inspire the same feelings in him were to hasten her final transformation back into that odette loved with an undisturbed affection who had taken him home one evening after a revel at the painter's to drink orangeade with forcheville that odette with whom swann had calculated that he might live in happiness in former times having often thought with terror that a day must come when he would cease to be in love with odette he had determined to keep a sharp look out and as soon as he felt that love was beginning to escape him to cling tightly to it and to hold it back but now to the faintness of his love there corresponded a simultaneous faintness in his desire to remain her lover for a man cannot change that is to say become another person while he continues to obey the dictates of the self which he has ceased to be occasionally the name if it caught his eye in a newspaper of one of the men whom he supposed to have been odette's lovers reawakened his jealousy but it was very slight and inasmuch as it proved to him that he had not completely emerged from that period in which he had so keenly suffered though in it he had also known a way of feeling so intensely happy and that the accidents of his course might still enable him to catch an occasional glimpse stealthily and at a distance of its beauties this jealousy gave him if anything an agreeable thrill as to the sad parisian when he has left venice behind him and must return to france a last mosquito proves that italy and summer are still not too remote but as a rule with this particular period of his life from which he was emerging when he made an effort if not to remain in it at least to obtain while still he might an uninterrupted view of it he discovered that already it was too late he would have looked back to distinguish as it might be a landscape that was about to disappear that love from which he had departed but it is so difficult to enter into a state of complete duality and to present to oneself the lifelike spectacle of a feeling which one has ceased to possess that very soon the clouds gathering in his brain he could see nothing he would abandon the attempt would take the glasses from his nose and wipe them and he told himself that he would do better to rest for a little that there would be time enough later on and settled back into his corner with as little curiosity with as much torpor as the drowsy traveller who pulls his cap down over his eyes so as to get some sleep in the railway carriage that is drawing him he feels faster and faster out of the country in which he has lived for so long and which he vowed that he would not allow to slip away from him without looking out to bid it a last farewell indeed like the same traveller if he does not awake until he has crossed the frontier and is again in france when swann happened to alight close at hand upon something which proved that forcheville had been odette's lover he discovered that it caused him no pain that love was now utterly remote and he regretted that he had had no warning of the moment in which he had emerged from it for ever and just as before kissing odette for the first time he had sought to imprint upon his memory the face that for so long had been familiar before it was altered by the additional memory of their kiss so he could have wished in thought at least to have been in a position to bid farewell while she still existed to that odette who had inspired love in him and jealousy to that odette who had caused him so to suffer and whom now he would never see again he was mistaken he was destined to see her once again a few weeks later it was while he was asleep in the twilight of a dream he was walking with mme verdurin dr cottard a young man in a fez whom he failed to identify the painter odette napoleon iii and my grandfather along a path which followed the line of the coast and overhung the sea now at a great height now by a few feet only so that they were continually going up and down those of the party who had reached the downward slope were no longer visible to those who were still climbing what little daylight yet remained was failing and it seemed as though a black night was immediately to fall on them now and then the waves dashed against the cliff and swann could feel on his cheek a shower of freezing spray odette told him to wipe this off but he could not and felt confused and helpless in her company as well as because he was in his nightshirt he hoped that in the darkness this might pass unnoticed mme verdurin however fixed her astonished gaze upon him for an endless moment in which he saw her face change its shape her nose grow longer while beneath it there sprouted a heavy moustache he turned away to examine odette her cheeks were pale with little fiery spots her features drawn and ringed with shadows but she looked back at him with eyes welling with affection ready to detach themselves like tears and to fall upon his face and he felt that he loved her so much that he would have liked to carry her off with him at once suddenly odette turned her wrist glanced at a tiny watch and said i must go she took leave of everyone in the same formal manner without taking swann aside without telling him where they were to meet that evening or next day he dared not ask he would have liked to follow her he was obliged without turning back in her direction to answer with a smile some question by mme verdurin but his heart was frantically beating he felt that he now hated odette he would gladly have crushed those eyes which a moment ago he had loved so dearly have torn the blood into those lifeless cheeks he continued to climb with mme verdurin that is to say that each step took him farther from odette who was going downhill and in the other direction a second passed and it was many hours since she had left him the painter remarked to swann that napoleon iii had eclipsed himself immediately after odette they had obviously arranged it between them he added they must have agreed to meet at the foot of the cliff but they wouldn't say good bye together it might have looked odd she is his mistress the strange young man burst into tears swann endeavoured to console him after all she is quite right he said to the young man drying his eyes for him and taking off the fez to make him feel more at ease i've advised her to do that myself a dozen times why be so distressed he was obviously the man to understand her so swann reasoned with himself for the young man whom he had failed at first to identify was himself also like certain novelists he had distributed his own personality between two characters him who was the 'first person' in the dream and another whom he saw before him capped with a fez as for napoleon iii it was to forcheville that some vague association of ideas then a certain modification of the baron's usual physiognomy and lastly the broad ribbon of the legion of honour across his breast had made swann give that name but actually and in everything that the person who appeared in his dream represented and recalled to him it was indeed forcheville for from an incomplete and changing set of images swann in his sleep drew false deductions enjoying at the same time such creative power that he was able to reproduce himself by a simple act of division like certain lower organisms with the warmth that he felt in his own palm he modelled the hollow of a strange hand which he thought that he was clasping and out of feelings and impressions of which he was not yet conscious he brought about sudden vicissitudes which by a chain of logical sequences would produce at definite points in his dream the person required to receive his love or to startle him awake in an instant night grew black about him an alarum rang the inhabitants ran past him escaping from their blazing houses he could hear the thunder of the surging waves and also of his own heart which with equal violence was anxiously beating in his breast suddenly the speed of these palpitations redoubled he felt a pain a nausea that were inexplicable a peasant dreadfully burned flung at him as he passed come and ask charlus where odette spent the night with her friend he used to go about with her and she tells him everything it was they that started the fire it was his valet come to awaken him and saying sir it is eight o'clock and the barber is here i have told him to call again in an hour but these words as they dived down through the waves of sleep in which swann was submerged did not reach his consciousness without undergoing that refraction which turns a ray of light at the bottom of a bowl of water into another sun just as a moment earlier the sound of the door bell swelling in the depths of his abyss of sleep into the clangour of an alarum had engendered the episode of the fire meanwhile the scenery of his dream stage scattered in dust he opened his eyes heard for the last time the boom of a wave in the sea grown very distant he touched his cheek it was dry and yet he could feel the sting of the cold spray and the taste of salt on his lips he rose and dressed himself he had made the barber come early because he had written the day before to my grandfather to say that he was going that afternoon to combray having learned that mme de cambremer mlle legrandin that had been was spending a few days there the association in his memory of her young and charming face with a place in the country which he had not visited for so long offered him a combined attraction which had made him decide at last to leave paris for a while as the different changes and chances that bring us into the company of certain other people in this life do not coincide with the periods in which we are in love with those people but overlapping them may occur before love has begun and may be repeated after love is ended the earliest appearances in our life of a creature who is destined to afford us pleasure later on assume retrospectively in our eyes a certain value as an indication a warning a presage it was in this fashion that swann had often carried back his mind to the image of odette encountered in the theatre on that first evening when he had no thought of ever seeing her again and that he now recalled the party at mme de saint euverte's at which he had introduced general de frober ville to mme de cambremer so manifold are our interests in life that it is not uncommon that on a single occasion the foundations of a happiness which does not yet exist are laid down simultaneously with aggravations of a grief from which we are still suffering and no doubt that might have occurred to swann elsewhere than at mme de saint euverte's who indeed can say whether in the event of his having gone that evening somewhere else other happinesses other griefs would not have come to him which later would have appeared to have been inevitable but what did seem to him to have been inevitable was what had indeed taken place and he was not far short of seeing something providential in the fact that he had at last decided to go to mme de saint euverte's that evening because his mind anxious to admire the richness of invention that life shews and incapable of facing a difficult problem for any length of time such as to discover what actually had been most to be wished for came to the conclusion that the sufferings through which he had passed that evening and the pleasures at that time unsuspected which were already being brought to birth the exact balance between which was too difficult to establish were linked by a sort of concatenation of necessity but while an hour after his awakening he was giving instructions to the barber so that his stiffly brushed hair should not become disarranged on the journey he thought once again of his dream he saw once again as he had felt them close beside him odette's pallid complexion her too thin cheeks her drawn features her tired eyes all the things which in the course of those successive bursts of affection which had made of his enduring love for odette a long oblivion of the first impression that he had formed of her he had ceased to observe after the first few days of their intimacy days to which doubtless while he slept his memory had returned to seek the exact sensation of those things and with that old intermittent fatuity which reappeared in him now that he was no longer unhappy and lowered at the same time the average level of his morality he cried out in his heart to think that i have wasted years of my life that i have longed for death that the greatest love that i have ever known has been for a woman who did not please me who was not in my style place names the name among the rooms which used most commonly to take shape in my mind during my long nights of sleeplessness there was none that differed more utterly from the rooms at combray thickly powdered with the motes of an atmosphere granular pollenous edible and instinct with piety than my room in the grand hôtel de la plage at balbec the walls of which washed with ripolin contained like the polished sides of a basin in which the water glows with a blue lurking fire a finer air pure azure tinted saline the bavarian upholsterer who had been entrusted with the furnishing of this hotel had varied his scheme of decoration in different rooms and in that which i found myself occupying had set against the walls on three sides of it a series of low book cases with glass fronts in which according to where they stood by a law of nature which he had perhaps forgotten to take into account was reflected this or that section of the ever changing view of the sea so that the walls were lined with a frieze of seascapes interrupted only by the polished mahogany of the actual shelves and so effective was this that the whole room had the appearance of one of those model bedrooms which you see nowadays in housing exhibitions decorated with works of art which are calculated by their designer to refresh the eyes of whoever may ultimately have to sleep in the rooms the subjects being kept in some degree of harmony with the locality and surroundings of the houses for which the rooms are planned and yet nothing could have differed more utterly either from the real balbec than that other balbec of which i had often dreamed on stormy days when the wind was so strong that françoise as she took me to the champs elysées would warn me not to walk too near the side of the street or i might have my head knocked off by a falling slate and would recount to me with many lamentations the terrible disasters and shipwrecks that were reported in the newspaper i longed for nothing more than to behold a storm at sea less as a mighty spectacle than as a momentary revelation of the true life of nature or rather there were for me no mighty spectacles save those which i knew to be not artificially composed for my entertainment but necessary and unalterable the beauty of landscapes or of great works of art i was not curious i did not thirst to know anything save what i believed to be more genuine than myself what had for me the supreme merit of shewing me a fragment of the mind of a great genius or of the force or the grace of nature as she appeared when left entirely to herself without human interference just as the lovely sound of her voice reproduced all by itself upon the phonograph could never console a man for the loss of his mother so a mechanical imitation of a storm would have left me as cold as did the illuminated fountains at the exhibition i required also if the storm was to be absolutely genuine that the shore from which i watched it should be a natural shore not an embankment recently constructed by a municipality besides nature by all the feelings that she aroused in me seemed to me the most opposite thing in the world to the mechanical inventions of mankind the less she bore their imprint the more room she offered for the expansion of my heart and as it happened i had preserved the name of balbec which legrandin had cited to us as that of a sea side place in the very midst of that funereal coast famed for the number of its wrecks swathed for six months in the year in a shroud of fog and flying foam from the waves you feel there below your feet still he had told me far more even than at finistère and even though hotels are now being superimposed upon it without power however to modify that oldest bone in the earth's skeleton you feel there that you are actually at the land's end of france of europe of the old world and it is the ultimate encampment of the fishermen precisely like the fishermen who have lived since the world's beginning facing the everlasting kingdom of the sea fogs and shadows of the night one day when at combray i had spoken of this coast this balbec before m swann hoping to learn from him whether it was the best point to select for seeing the most violent storms he had replied i should think i did know balbec the church at balbec built in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries and still half romanesque is perhaps the most curious example to be found of our norman gothic and so exceptional that one is tempted to describe it as persian in its inspiration and that region which until then had seemed to me to be nothing else than a part of immemorial nature that had remained contemporaneous with the great phenomena of geology and as remote from human history as the ocean itself or the great bear with its wild race of fishermen for whom no more than for their whales had there been any middle ages it had been a great joy to me to see it suddenly take its place in the order of the centuries with a stored consciousness of the romanesque epoch and to know that the gothic trefoil had come to diversify those wild rocks also at the appointed hour like those frail but hardy plants which in the polar regions when the spring returns scatter their stars about the eternal snows and if gothic art brought to those places and people a classification which otherwise they lacked they too conferred one upon it in return i tried to form a picture in my mind of how those fishermen had lived the timid and unsuspected essay towards social intercourse which they had attempted there clustered upon a promontory of the shores of hell at the foot of the cliffs of death and gothic art seemed to me a more living thing now that detaching it from the towns in which until then i had always imagined it i could see how in a particular instance upon a reef of savage rocks it had taken root and grown until it flowered in a tapering spire i was taken to see reproductions of the most famous of the statues at balbec shaggy blunt faced apostles the virgin from the porch and i could scarcely breathe for joy at the thought that i might myself one day see them take a solid form against their eternal background of salt fog thereafter on dear tempestuous february nights the wind breathing into my heart which it shook no less violently than the chimney of my bedroom the project of a visit to balbec blended in me the desire for gothic architecture with that for a storm upon the sea i should have liked to take the very next day the good the generous train at one twenty two of which never without a palpitating heart could i read in the railway company's bills or in advertisements of circular tours the hour of departure it seemed to me to cut at a precise point in every afternoon a most fascinating groove a mysterious mark from which the diverted hours still led one on of course towards evening towards to morrow morning but to an evening and morning which one would behold not in paris but in one of those towns through which the train passed and among which it allowed one to choose for it stopped at bayeux at coutances at vitré at questambert at pontorson at balbec at lannion at lamballe at benodet at pont aven at quimperle and progressed magnificently surcharged with names which it offered me so that among them all i did not know which to choose so impossible was it to sacrifice any but even without waiting for the train next day i could by rising and dressing myself with all speed leave paris that very evening should my parents permit and arrive at balbec as dawn spread westward over the raging sea from whose driven foam i would seek shelter in that church in the persian manner but at the approach of the easter holidays when my parents had promised to let me spend them for once in the north of italy lo in place of those dreams of tempests by which i had been entirely possessed not wishing to see anything but waves dashing in from all sides mounting always higher upon the wildest of coasts beside churches as rugged and precipitous as cliffs in whose towers the sea birds would be wailing suddenly effacing them taking away all their charm excluding them because they were its opposite and could only have weakened its effect was substituted in me the converse dream of the most variegated of springs not the spring of combray still pricking with all the needle points of the winter's frost but that which already covered with lilies and anemones the meadows of fiesole and gave florence a dazzling golden background like those in fra angelico's pictures from that moment only sunlight perfumes colours seemed to me to have any value for this alternation of images had effected a change of front in my desire and as abrupt as those that occur sometimes in music a complete change of tone in my sensibility thus it came about that a mere atmospheric variation would be sufficient to provoke in me that modulation without there being any need for me to await the return of a season for often we find a day in one that has strayed from another season and makes us live in that other summons at once into our presence and makes us long for its peculiar pleasures and interrupts the dreams that we were in process of weaving by inserting out of its turn too early or too late this leaf torn from another chapter in the interpolated calendar of happiness but soon it happened that like those natural phenomena from which our comfort or our health can derive but an accidental and all too modest benefit until the day when science takes control of them and producing them at will places in our hands the power to order their appearance withdrawn from the tutelage and independent of the consent of chance similarly the production of these dreams of the atlantic and of italy ceased to depend entirely upon the changes of the seasons and of the weather i need only to make them reappear pronounce the names balbec venice florence within whose syllables had gradually accumulated all the longing inspired in me by the places for which they stood even in spring to come in a book upon the name of balbec sufficed to awaken in me the desire for storms at sea and for the norman gothic even on a stormy day the name of florence or of venice would awaken the desire for sunshine for lilies for the palace of the doges and for santa maria del fiore but if their names thus permanently absorbed the image that i had formed of these towns it was only by transforming that image by subordinating its reappearance in me to their own special laws and in consequence of this they made it more beautiful but at the same time more different from anything that the towns of normandy or tuscany could in reality be and by increasing the arbitrary delights of my imagination aggravated the disenchantment that was in store for me when i set out upon my travels they magnified the idea that i formed of certain points on the earth's surface making them more special and in consequence more real i did not then represent to myself towns landscapes historic buildings as pictures more or less attractive cut out here and there of a substance that was common to them all but looked on each of them as on an unknown thing different from all the rest a thing for which my soul was athirst by the knowledge of which it would benefit how much more individual still was the character that they assumed from being designated by names names that were only for themselves proper names such as people have words present to us little pictures of things lucid and normal like the pictures that are hung on the walls of schoolrooms to give children an illustration of what is meant by a carpenter's bench a bird an ant hill things chosen as typical of everything else of the same sort but names present to us of persons and of towns which they accustom us to regard as individual as unique like persons a confused picture which draws from the names from the brightness or darkness of their sound the colour in which it is uniformly painted like one of those posters entirely blue or entirely red in which on account of the limitations imposed by the process used in their reproduction or by a whim on the designer's part are blue or red not only the sky and the sea but the ships and the church and the people in the streets the name of parma one of the towns that i most longed to visit after reading the chartreuse seeming to me compact and glossy violet tinted soft if anyone were to speak of such or such a house in parma in which i should be lodged he would give me the pleasure of thinking that i was to inhabit a dwelling that was compact and glossy violet tinted soft and that bore no relation to the houses in any other town in italy since i could imagine it only by the aid of that heavy syllable of the name of parma in which no breath of air stirred and of all that i had made it assume of stendhalian sweetness and the reflected hue of violets and when i thought of florence it was of a town miraculously embalmed and flower like since it was called the city of the lilies and its cathedral our lady of the flower as for balbec it was one of those names in which as on an old piece of norman pottery that still keeps the colour of the earth from which it was fashioned one sees depicted still the representation of some long abolished custom of some feudal right of the former condition of some place of an obsolete way of pronouncing the language which had shaped and wedded its incongruous syllables and which i never doubted that i should find spoken there at once even by the inn keeper who would pour me out coffee and milk on my arrival taking me down to watch the turbulent sea unchained before the church to whom i lent the aspect disputatious solemn and mediaeval of some character in one of the old romances had my health definitely improved had my parents allowed me if not actually to go down to stay at balbec at least to take just once so as to become acquainted with the architecture and landscapes of normandy or of brittany that one twenty two train into which i had so often clambered in imagination i should have preferred to stop and to alight from it at the most beautiful of its towns but in vain might i compare and contrast them how was one to choose any more than between individual people who are not interchangeable between bayeux so lofty in its noble coronet of rusty lace whose highest point caught the light of the old gold of its second syllable vitré whose acute accent barred its ancient glass with wooden lozenges gentle lamballe whose whiteness ranged from egg shell yellow to a pearly grey coutances a norman cathedral which its final consonants rich and yellowing crowned with a tower of butter lannion with the rumble and buzz in the silence of its village street of the fly on the wheel of the coach questambert pontorson ridiculously silly and simple white feathers and yellow beaks strewn along the road to those well watered and poetic spots benodet a name scarcely moored that seemed to be striving to draw the river down into the tangle of its seaweeds pont aven the snowy rosy flight of the wing of a lightly poised coif tremulously reflected in the greenish waters of a canal quimperlé more firmly attached this and since the middle ages among the rivulets with which it babbled threading their pearls upon a grey background like the pattern made through the cobwebs upon a window by rays of sunlight changed into blunt points of tarnished silver these images were false for another reason also namely that they were necessarily much simplified doubtless the object to which my imagination aspired which my senses took in but incompletely and without any immediate pleasure i had committed to the safe custody of names doubtless because i had accumulated there a store of dreams those names now magnetised my desires but names themselves are not very comprehensive the most that i could do was to include in each of them two or three of the principal curiosities of the town which would lie there side by side without interval or partition in the name of balbec as in the magnifying glasses set in those penholders which one buys at sea side places i could distinguish waves surging round a church built in the persian manner perhaps indeed the enforced simplicity of these images was one of the reasons for the hold that they had over me when my father had decided one year that we should go for the easter holidays to florence and venice not finding room to introduce into the name of florence the elements that ordinarily constitute a town i was obliged to let a supernatural city emerge from the impregnation by certain vernal scenes of what i supposed to be in its essentials the genius of giotto all the more and because one cannot make a name extend much further in time than in space like some of giotto's paintings themselves which shew us at two separate moments the same person engaged in different actions here lying on his bed there just about to mount his horse the name of florence was divided into two compartments in one beneath an architectural dais i gazed upon a fresco over which was partly drawn a curtain of morning sunlight dusty aslant and gradually spreading in the other for since i thought of names not as an inaccessible ideal but as a real and enveloping substance into which i was about to plunge the life not yet lived the life intact and pure which i enclosed in them gave to the most material pleasures to the simplest scenes the same attraction that they have in the works of the primitives i moved swiftly so as to arrive as soon as might be at the table that was spread for me with fruit and a flask of chianti across a ponte vecchio heaped with jonquils narcissi and anemones that for all that i was still in paris was what i saw and not what was actually round about me even from the simplest the most realistic point of view the countries for which we long occupy at any given moment a far larger place in our true life than the country in which we may happen to be doubtless if at that time i had paid more attention to what was in my mind when i pronounced the words going to florence to parma to pisa to venice i should have realised that what i saw was in no sense a town but something as different from anything that i knew something as delicious as might be for a human race whose whole existence had passed in a series of late winter afternoons that inconceivable marvel a morning in spring these images unreal fixed always alike filling all my nights and days differentiated this period in my life from those which had gone before it and might easily have been confused with it by an observer who saw things only from without that is to say who saw nothing as in an opera a fresh melody introduces a novel atmosphere which one could never have suspected if one had done no more than read the libretto still less if one had remained outside the theatre counting only the minutes as they passed and besides even from the point of view of mere quantity in our life the days are not all equal to reach the end of a day natures that are slightly nervous as mine was make use like motor cars of different 'speeds ' there are mountainous uncomfortable days up which one takes an infinite time to pass and days downward sloping through which one can go at full tilt singing as one goes during this month in which i went laboriously over as over a tune though never to my satisfaction these visions of florence venice pisa from which the desire that they excited in me drew and kept something as profoundly personal as if it had been love love for another person i never ceased to believe that they corresponded to a reality independent of myself and they made me conscious of as glorious a hope as could have been cherished by a christian in the primitive age of faith on the eve of his entry into paradise moreover without my paying any heed to the contradiction that there was in my wishing to look at and to touch with my organs of sense what had been elaborated by the spell of my dreams and not perceived by my senses at all though all the more tempting to them in consequence more different from anything that they knew it was that which recalled to me the reality of these visions which inflamed my desire all the more by seeming to hint a promise that my desire should be satisfied and for all that the motive force of my exaltation was a longing for aesthetic enjoyments the guide books ministered even more to it than books on aesthetics and more again than the guide books the railway time tables what moved me was the thought that this florence which i could see so near and yet inaccessible in my imagination if the tract which separated it from me in myself was not one that i might cross could yet be reached by a circuit by a digression were i to take the plain terrestrial path when i repeated to myself giving thus a special value to what i was going to see that venice was the school of giorgione the home of titian the most complete museum of the domestic architecture of the middle ages i felt happy indeed as i was even more when on one of my walks as i stepped out briskly on account of the weather which after several days of a precocious spring had relapsed into winter like the weather that we had invariably found awaiting us at combray in holy week seeing upon the boulevards that the chestnut trees though plunged in a glacial atmosphere that soaked through them like a stream of water were none the less beginning punctual guests arrayed already for the party and admitting no discouragement to shape and chisel and curve in its frozen lumps the irrepressible verdure whose steady growth the abortive power of the cold might hinder but could not succeed in restraining i reflected that already the ponte vecchio was heaped high with an abundance of hyacinths and anemones and that the spring sunshine was already tinging the waves of the grand canal with so dusky an azure with emeralds so splendid that when they washed and were broken against the foot of one of titian's paintings they could vie with it in the richness of their colouring i could no longer contain my joy when my father in the intervals of tapping the barometer and complaining of the cold began to look out which were the best trains and when i understood that by making one's way after luncheon into the coal grimed laboratory the wizard's cell that undertook to contrive a complete transmutation of its surroundings one could awaken next morning in the city of marble and gold in which the building of the wall was of jasper and the foundation of the wall an emerald so that it and the city of the lilies were not just artificial scenes which i could set up at my pleasure in front of my imagination but did actually exist at a certain distance from paris which must inevitably be traversed if i wished to see them at their appointed place on the earth's surface and at no other in a word they were entirely real they became even more real to me when my father by saying well you can stay in venice from the 20th to the 29th and reach florence on easter morning made them both emerge no longer only from the abstraction of space but from that imaginary time in which we place not one merely but several of our travels at once which do not greatly tax us since they are but possibilities that time which reconstructs itself so effectively that one can spend it again in one town after one has already spent it in another and consecrated to them some of those actual calendar days which are certificates of the genuineness of what one does on them for those unique days are consumed by being used they do not return one cannot live them again here when one has lived them elsewhere i felt that it was towards the week that would begin with the monday on which the laundress was to bring back the white waistcoat that i had stained with ink that they were hastening to busy themselves with the duty of emerging from that ideal time in which they did not as yet exist those two queen cities of which i was soon to be able by the most absorbing kind of geometry to inscribe the domes and towers on a page of my own life but i was still on the way only to the supreme pinnacle of happiness i reached it finally for not until then did the revelation burst upon me that on the clattering streets reddened by the light reflected from giorgione's frescoes it was not as i had despite so many promptings continued to imagine the men majestic and terrible as the sea bearing armour that gleamed with bronze beneath the folds of their blood red cloaks who would be walking in venice next week on the easter vigil but that i myself might be the minute personage whom in an enlarged photograph of st mark's that had been lent to me the operator had portrayed in a bowler hat in front of the portico when i heard my father say it must be pretty cold still on the grand canal whatever you do don't forget to pack your winter greatcoat and your thick suit at these words i was raised to a sort of ecstasy a thing that i had until then deemed impossible i felt myself to be penetrating indeed between those rocks of amethyst like a reef in the indian ocean by a supreme muscular effort a long way in excess of my real strength stripping myself as of a shell that served no purpose of the air in my own room which surrounded me i replaced it by an equal quantity of venetian air that marine atmosphere indescribable and peculiar as the atmosphere of the dreams which my imagination had secreted in the name of venice i could feel at work within me a miraculous disincarnation it was at once accompanied by that vague desire to vomit which one feels when one has a very sore throat and they had to put me to bed with a fever so persistent that the doctor not only assured my parents that a visit that spring to florence and venice was absolutely out of the question but warned their that even when i should have completely recovered i must for at least a year give up all idea of travelling and be kept from anything that was liable to excite me and alas he forbade also most categorically my being allowed to go to the theatre to hear berma the sublime artist whose genius bergotte had proclaimed might by introducing me to something else that was perhaps as important and as beautiful have consoled me for not having been to florence and venice for not going to balbec my parents had to be content with sending me every day to the champs elysées in the custody of a person who would see that i did not tire myself this person was none other than françoise who had entered our service after the death of my aunt léonie going to the champs elysées i found unendurable if only bergotte had described the place in one of his books i should no doubt have longed to see and to know it like so many things else of which a simulacrum had first found its way into my imagination that kept things warm made them live gave them personality and i sought then to find their counterpart in reality but in this public garden there was nothing that attached itself to my dreams one day as i was weary of our usual place beside the wooden horses françoise had taken me for an excursion across the frontier guarded at regular intervals by the little bastions of the barley sugar women into those neighbouring but foreign regions where the faces of the passers by were strange where the goat carriage went past then she had gone away to lay down her things on a chair that stood with its back to a shrubbery of laurels while i waited for her i was pacing the broad lawn of meagre close cropped grass already faded by the sun dominated at its far end by a statue rising from a fountain in front of which a little girl with reddish hair was playing with a shuttlecock when from the path another little girl who was putting on her cloak and covering up her battledore called out sharply good bye gilberte i'm going home now don't forget we're coming to you this evening after dinner the name gilberte passed close by me evoking all the more forcibly her whom it labelled in that it did not merely refer to her as one speaks of a man in his absence but was directly addressed to her it passed thus close by me in action so to speak with a force that increased with the curve of its trajectory and as it drew near to its target carrying in its wake i could feel the knowledge the impression of her to whom it was addressed that belonged not to me but to the friend who called to her everything that while she uttered the words she more or less vividly reviewed possessed in her memory of their daily intimacy of the visits that they paid to each other of that unknown existence which was all the more inaccessible all the more painful to me from being conversely so familiar so tractable to this happy girl who let her message brush past me without my being able to penetrate its surface who flung it on the air with a light hearted cry letting float in the atmosphere the delicious attar which that message had distilled by touching them with precision from certain invisible points in mlle swann's life from the evening to come as it would be after dinner at her home forming on its celestial passage through the midst of the children and their nursemaids a little cloud exquisitely coloured like the cloud that curling over one of poussin's gardens reflects minutely like a cloud in the opera teeming with chariots and horses some apparition of the life of the gods casting finally on that ragged grass at the spot on which she stood at once a scrap of withered lawn and a moment in the afternoon of the fair player who continued to beat up and catch her shuttlecock until a governess with a blue feather in her hat had called her away a marvellous little band of light of the colour of heliotrope spread over the lawn like a carpet on which i could not tire of treading to and fro with lingering feet nostalgic and profane while françoise shouted come on button up your coat look and let's get away and i remarked for the first time how common her speech was and that she had alas no blue feather in her hat only would she come again to the champs elysées next day she was not there but i saw her on the following days i spent all my time revolving round the spot where she was at play with her friends to such effect that once when they found they were not enough to make up a prisoner's base she sent one of them to ask me if i cared to complete their side and from that day i played with her whenever she came but this did not happen every day there were days when she had been prevented from coming by her lessons by her catechism by a luncheon party by the whole of that life separated from my own which twice only condensed into the name of gilberte i had felt pass so painfully close to me in the hawthorn lane near combray and on the grass of the champs elysées on such days she would have told us beforehand that we should not see her if it were because of her lessons she would say it is too tiresome i sha'n't be able to come to morrow you will all be enjoying yourselves here without me with an air of regret which to some extent consoled me if on the other hand she had been invited to a party and i not knowing this asked her whether she was coming to play with us she would reply indeed i hope not indeed i hope mamma will let me go to my friend's but on these days i did at least know that i should not see her whereas on others without any warning her mother would take her for a drive or some such thing and next day she would say oh yes i went out with mamma as though it had been the most natural thing in the world and not the greatest possible misfortune for some one else there were also the days of bad weather on which her governess afraid on her own account of the rain would not bring gilberte to the champs elysées and so if the heavens were doubtful from early morning i would not cease to interrogate them observing all the omens if i saw the lady opposite just inside her window putting on her hat i would say to myself that lady is going out it must therefore be weather in which one can go out why should not gilberte do the same as that lady but the day grew dark my mother said that it might clear again that one burst of sunshine would be enough but that more probably it would rain and if it rained of what use would it be to go to the champs elysées and so from breakfast time my anxious eyes never left the uncertain clouded sky it remained dark outside the window the balcony was grey suddenly on its sullen stone i did not indeed see a less negative colour but i felt as it were an effort towards a less negative colour the pulsation of a hesitating ray that struggled to discharge its light a moment later the balcony was as pale and luminous as a standing water at dawn and a thousand shadows from the iron work of its balustrade had come to rest on it a breath of wind dispersed them the stone grew dark again but like tamed creatures they returned they began imperceptibly to grow lighter and by one of those continuous crescendos such as in music at the end of an overture carry a single note to the extreme fortissimo making it pass rapidly through all the intermediate stages i saw it attain to that fixed unalterable gold of fine days on which the sharply cut shadows of the wrought iron of the balustrade were outlined in black like a capricious vegetation with a fineness in the delineation of their smallest details which seemed to indicate a deliberate application an artist's satisfaction and with so much relief so velvety a bloom in the restfulness of their sombre and happy mass that in truth those large and leafy shadows which lay reflected on that lake of sunshine seemed aware that they were pledges of happiness and peace of mind brief fading ivy climbing fugitive flora the most colourless the most depressing to many minds of all that creep on walls or decorate windows to me the dearest of them all from the day when it appeared upon our balcony like the very shadow of the presence of gilberte who was perhaps already in the champs elysées and as soon as i arrived there would greet me with let's begin at once you are on my side frail swept away by a breath but at the same time in harmony not with the season with the hour a promise of that immediate pleasure which the day will deny or fulfil and thereby of the one paramount immediate pleasure the pleasure of loving and of being loved more soft more warm upon the stone than even moss is alive a ray of sunshine sufficing for its birth and for the birth of joy even in the heart of winter and on those days when all other vegetation had disappeared when the fine jerkins of green leather which covered the trunks of the old trees were hidden beneath the snow after the snow had ceased to fall but when the sky was still too much overcast for me to hope that gilberte would venture out then suddenly inspiring my mother to say look it's quite fine now i think you might perhaps try going to the champs elysées after all on the mantle of snow that swathed the balcony the sun had appeared and was stitching seams of gold with embroidered patches of dark shadow that day we found no one there or else a solitary girl on the point of departure who assured me that gilberte was not coming the chairs deserted by the imposing but uninspiring company of governesses stood empty only near the grass was sitting a lady of uncertain age who came in all weathers dressed always in an identical style splendid and sombre to make whose acquaintance i would have at that period sacrificed had it lain in my power all the greatest opportunities in my life to come for gilberte went up every day to speak to her she used to ask gilberte for news of her dearest mother and it struck me that if i had known her i should have been for gilberte some one wholly different some one who knew people in her parents' world while her grandchildren played together at a little distance she would sit and read the débats which she called my old débats as with an aristocratic familiarity she would say speaking of the police sergeant or the woman who let the chairs my old friend the police sergeant or the chair keeper and i who are old friends françoise found it too cold to stand about so we walked to the pont de la concorde to see the seine frozen over on to which everyone even children walked fearlessly as though upon an enormous whale stranded defenceless and about to be cut up we returned to the champs elysées i was growing sick with misery between the motionless wooden horses and the white lawn caught in a net of black paths from which the snow had been cleared while the statue that surmounted it held in its hand a long pendent icicle which seemed to explain its gesture the old lady herself having folded up her débats asked a passing nursemaid the time thanking her with how very good of you then begged the road sweeper to tell her grandchildren to come as she felt cold adding a thousand thanks i am sorry to give you so much trouble suddenly the sky was rent in two between the punch and judy and the horses against the opening horizon i had just seen like a miraculous sign mademoiselle's blue feather and now gilberte was running at full speed towards me sparkling and rosy beneath a cap trimmed with fur enlivened by the cold by being late by her anxiety for a game shortly before she reached me she slipped on a piece of ice and either to regain her balance or because it appeared to her graceful or else pretending that she was on skates it was with outstretched arms that she smilingly advanced as though to embrace me bravo bravo that's splendid 'topping ' i should say like you 'sporting ' i suppose i ought to say only i'm a hundred and one a woman of the old school exclaimed the lady uttering on behalf of the voiceless champs elysées their thanks to gilberte for having come without letting herself be frightened away by the weather you are like me faithful at all costs to our old champs elysées we are two brave souls you wouldn't believe me i dare say if i told you that i love them even like this this snow i know you'll laugh at me it makes me think of ermine and the old lady began to laugh herself the first of these days to which the snow a symbol of the powers that were able to deprive me of the sight of gilberte imparted the sadness of a day of separation almost the aspect of a day of departure because it changed the outward form and almost forbade the use of the customary scene of our only encounters now altered covered as it were in dust sheets that day none the less marked a stage in the progress of my love for it was in a sense the first sorrow that she was to share with me there were only our two selves of our little company and to be thus alone with her was not merely like a beginning of intimacy but also on her part as though she had come there solely to please me and in such weather it seemed to me as touching as if on one of those days on which she had been invited to a party she had given it up in order to come to me in the champs elysées i acquired more confidence in the vitality in the future of a friendship which could remain so much alive amid the torpor the solitude the decay of our surroundings and while she dropped pellets of snow down my neck i smiled lovingly at what seemed to me at once a predilection that she shewed for me in thus tolerating me as her travelling companion in this new this wintry land and a sort of loyalty to me which she preserved through evil times presently one after another like shyly bopping sparrows her friends arrived black against the snow we got ready to play and since this day which had begun so sadly was destined to end in joy as i went up before the game started to the friend with the sharp voice whom i had heard that first day calling gilberte by name she said to me no no i'm sure you'd much rather be in gilberte's camp besides look she's signalling to you she was in fact summoning me to cross the snowy lawn to her camp to 'take the field ' which the sun by casting over it a rosy gleam the metallic lustre of old and worn brocades had turned into a field of the cloth of gold this day which i had begun with so many misgivings was as it happened one of the few on which i was not unduly wretched for although i no longer thought now of anything save not to let a single day pass without seeing gilberte so much so that once when my grandmother had not come home by dinner time i could not resist the instinctive reflection that if she had been run over in the street and killed i should not for some time be allowed to play in the champs elysées when one is in love one has no love left for anyone yet those moments which i spent in her company for which i had waited with so much impatience all night and morning for which i had quivered with excitement to which i would have sacrificed everything else in the world were by no means happy moments well did i know it for they were the only moments in my life on which i concentrated a scrupulous undistracted attention and yet i could not discover in them one atom of pleasure all the time that i was away from gilberte i wanted to see her because having incessantly sought to form a mental picture of her i was unable in the end to do so and did not know exactly to what my love corresponded besides she had never yet told me that she loved me far from it she had often boasted that she knew other little boys whom she preferred to myself that i was a good companion with whom she was always willing to play although i was too absent minded not attentive enough to the game moreover she had often shewn signs of apparent coldness towards me which might have shaken my faith that i was for her a creature different from the rest had that faith been founded upon a love that gilberte had felt for me and not as was the case upon the love that i felt for her which strengthened its resistance to the assaults of doubt by making it depend entirely upon the manner in which i was obliged by an internal compulsion to think of gilberte but my feelings with regard to her i had never yet ventured to express to her in words of course on every page of my exercise books i wrote out in endless repetition her name and address but at the sight of those vague lines which i might trace without her having to think on that account of me i felt discouraged because they spoke to me not of gilberte who would never so much as see them but of my own desire which they seemed to shew me in its true colours as something purely personal unreal tedious and ineffective the most important thing was that we should see each other gilberte and i and should have an opportunity of making a mutual confession of our love which until then would not officially so to speak have begun doubtless the various reasons which made me so impatient to see her would have appeared less urgent to a grown man as life goes on we acquire such adroitness in the culture of our pleasures that we content ourselves with that which we derive from thinking of a woman as i was thinking of gilberte without troubling ourselves to ascertain whether the image corresponds to the reality and with the pleasure of loving her without needing to be sure also that she loves us or again that we renounce the pleasure of confessing our passion for her so as to preserve and enhance the passion that she has for us like those japanese gardeners who to obtain one perfect blossom will sacrifice the rest but at the period when i was in love with gilberte i still believed that love did really exist apart from ourselves that allowing us at the most to surmount the obstacles in our way it offered us its blessings in an order in which we were not free to make the least alteration it seemed to me that if i had on my own initiative substituted for the sweetness of a confession a pretence of indifference i should not only have been depriving myself of one of the joys of which i had most often dreamed i should have been fabricating of my own free will a love that was artificial and without value that bore no relation to the truth whose mysterious and foreordained ways i should thus have been declining to follow but when i arrived at the champs elysées and as at first sight it appeared was in a position to confront my love so as to make it undergo the necessary modifications with its living and independent cause as soon as i was in the presence of that gilberte swann on the sight of whom i had counted to revive the images that my tired memory had lost and could not find again of that gilberte swann with whom i had been playing the day before and whom i had just been prompted to greet and then to recognise by a blind instinct like that which when we are walking sets one foot before the other without giving us time to think what we are doing then at once it became as though she and the little girl who had inspired my dreams had been two different people if for instance i had retained in my memory overnight two fiery eyes above plump and rosy cheeks gilberte's face would now offer me and with emphasis something that i distinctly had not remembered a certain sharpening and prolongation of the nose which instantaneously associating itself with certain others of her features assumed the importance of those characteristics which in natural history are used to define a species and transformed her into a little girl of the kind that have sharpened profiles while i was making myself ready to take advantage of this long expected moment and to surrender myself to the impression of gilberte which i had prepared beforehand but could no longer find in my head to an extent which would enable me during the long hours which i must spend alone to be certain that it was indeed herself whom i had in mind that it was indeed my love for her that i was gradually making grow as a book grows when one is writing it she threw me a ball and like the idealist philosopher whose body takes account of the external world in the reality of which his intellect declines to believe the same self which had made me salute her before i had identified her now urged me to catch the ball that she tossed to me as though she had been a companion with whom i had come to play and not a sister soul with whom my soul had come to be united made me out of politeness until the time came when she had to i go address a thousand polite and trivial remarks to her and so prevented me both from keeping a silence in which i might at last have laid my hand upon the indispensable escaped idea and from uttering the words which might have made that definite progress in the course of our love on which i was always obliged to count only for the following afternoon there was however an occasional development one day we had gone with gilberte to the stall of our own special vendor who was always particularly nice to us since it was to her that m swann used to send for his gingerbread of which for reasons of health he suffered from a racial eczema and from the constipation of the prophets he consumed a great quantity gilberte pointed out to me with a laugh two little boys who were like the little artist and the little naturalist in the children's storybooks for one of them would not have a red stick of rock because he preferred the purple while the other with tears in his eyes refused a plum which his nurse was buying for him because as he finally explained in passionate tones i want the other plum it's got a worm in it i purchased two ha'penny marbles with admiring eyes i saw luminous and imprisoned in a bowl by themselves the agate marbles which seemed precious to me because they were as fair and smiling as little girls and because they cost five pence each gilberte who was given a great deal more pocket money than i ever had asked me which i thought the prettiest they were as transparent as liquid seeming as life itself i would not have had her sacrifice a single one of them i should have liked her to be able to buy them to liberate them all still i pointed out one that had the same colour as her eyes gilberte took it turned it about until it shone with a ray of gold fondled it paid its ransom but at once handed me her captive saying take it it is for you i give it to you keep it to remind yourself of me another time being still obsessed by the desire to hear berma in classic drama i had asked her whether she had not a copy of a pamphlet in which bergotte spoke of racine and which was now out of print she had told me to let her know the exact title of it and that evening i had sent her a little telegram writing on its envelope the name gilberte swann which i had so often traced in my exercise books next day she brought me in a parcel tied with pink bows and sealed with white wax the pamphlet a copy of which she had managed to find you see it is what you asked me for she said taking from her muff the telegram that i had sent her but in the address on the pneumatic message which only yesterday was nothing was merely a 'little blue' that i had written and after a messenger had delivered it to gilberte's porter and a servant had taken it to her in her room had become a thing without value or distinction one of the 'little blues' that she had received in the course of the day i had difficulty in recognising the futile straggling lines of my own handwriting beneath the circles stamped on it at the post office the inscriptions added in pencil by a postman signs of effectual realisation seals of the external world violet bands symbolical of life itself which for the first time came to espouse to maintain to raise to rejoice my dream and there was another day on which she said to me you know you may call me 'gilberte' in any case i'm going to call you by your first name it's too silly not to yet she continued for a while to address me by the more formal ' vous ' and when i drew her attention to this smiled and composing constructing a phrase like those that are put into the grammar books of foreign languages with no other object than to teach us to make use of a new word ended it with my christian name and when i recalled later what i had felt at the time i could distinguish the impression of having been held for a moment in her mouth myself naked without any longer any of the social qualifications which belonged equally to her other companions and when she used my surname to my parents accessories of which her lips by the effort that she made a little after her father's manner to articulate the words to which she wished to give a special value had the air of stripping of divesting me as one peels the skin from a fruit of which one is going to put only the pulp into one's mouth while her glance adapting itself to the same new degree of intimacy as her speech fell on me also more directly not without testifying to the consciousness the pleasure even the gratitude that it felt accompanying itself with a smile but at that actual moment i was not able to appreciate the worth of these new pleasures they were given not by the little girl whom i loved to me who loved her but by the other her with whom i used to play to my other self who possessed neither the memory of the true gilberte nor the fixed heart which alone could have known the value of a happiness for which it alone had longed even after i had returned home i did not taste them since every day the necessity which made me hope that on the morrow i should arrive at the clear calm happy contemplation of gilberte that she would at last confess her love for me explaining to me the reasons by which she had been obliged hitherto to conceal it that same necessity forced me to regard the past as of no account to look ahead of me only to consider the little advantages that she had given me not in themselves and as if they were self sufficient but like fresh rungs of the ladder on which i might set my feet which were going to allow me to advance a step further and finally to attain the happiness which i had not yet encountered if at times she shewed me these marks of her affection she troubled me also by seeming not to be pleased to see me and this happened often on the very days on which i had most counted for the realisation of my hopes i was sure that gilberte was coming to the champs elysées and i felt an elation which seemed merely the anticipation of a great happiness when going into the drawing room in the morning to kiss mamma who was already dressed to go out the coils of her black hair elaborately built up and her beautiful hands plump and white fragrant still with soap i had been apprised by seeing a column of dust standing by itself in the air above the piano and by hearing a barrel organ playing beneath the window en revenant de la revue that the winter had received until nightfall an unexpected radiant visit from a day of spring while we sat at luncheon by opening her window the lady opposite had sent packing in the twinkling of an eye from beside my chair to sweep in a single stride over the whole width of our dining room a sunbeam which had lain down there for its midday rest and returned to continue it there a moment later at school during the one o'clock lesson the sun made me sick with impatience and boredom as it let fall a golden stream that crept to the edge of my desk like an invitation to the feast at which i could not myself arrive before three o'clock until the moment when françoise came to fetch me at the school gate and we made our way towards the champs elysées through streets decorated with sunlight dense with people over which the balconies detached by the sun and made vaporous seemed to float in front of the houses like clouds of gold alas in the champs elysées i found no gilberte she had not yet arrived motionless on the lawn nurtured by the invisible sun which here and there kindled to a flame the point of a blade of grass while the pigeons that had alighted upon it had the appearance of ancient sculptures which the gardener's pick had heaved to the surface of a hallowed soil i stood with my eyes fixed on the horizon expecting at every moment to see appear the form of gilberte following that of her governess behind the statue that seemed to be holding out the child which it had in its arms and which glistened in the stream of light to receive benediction from the sun the old lady who read the débats was sitting on her chair in her invariable place and had just accosted a park keeper with a friendly wave of her hands towards him as she exclaimed what a lovely day and when the chair woman came up to collect her penny with an infinity of smirks and affectations she folded the ticket away inside her glove as though it had been a posy of flowers for which she had sought in gratitude to the donor the most becoming place upon her person when she had found it she performed a circular movement with her neck straightened her boa and fastened upon the collector as she shewed her the end of yellow paper that stuck out over her bare wrist the bewitching smile with which a woman says to a young man pointing to her bosom you see i'm wearing your roses i dragged françoise on the way towards gilberte as far as the arc de triomphe we did not meet her and i was returning towards the lawn convinced now that she was not coming when in front of the wooden horses the little girl with the sharp voice flung herself upon me quick quick gilberte's been here a quarter of an hour she's just going we've been waiting for you to make up a prisoner's base while i had been going up the avenue des champs elysées gilberte had arrived by the rue boissy d'anglas mademoiselle having taken advantage of the fine weather to go on some errand of her own and m swann was coming to fetch his daughter and so it was my fault i ought not to have strayed from the lawn for one never knew for certain from what direction gilberte would appear whether she would be early or late and this perpetual tension succeeded in making more impressive not only the champs elysées in their entirety and the whole span of the afternoon like a vast expanse of space and time on every point and at every moment of which it was possible that the form of gilberte might appear but also that form itself since behind its appearance i felt that there lay concealed the reason for which it had shot its arrow into my heart at four o'clock instead of at half past two crowned with a smart hat for paying calls instead of the plain cap for games in front of the ambassadeurs and not between the two puppet shows i divined one of those occupations in which i might not follow gilberte occupations that forced her to go out or to stay at home i was in contact with the mystery of her unknown life it was this mystery too which troubled me when running at the sharp voiced girl's bidding so as to begin our game without more delay i saw gilberte so quick and informal with us make a ceremonious bow to the old lady with the débats who acknowledged it with what a lovely sun you'd think there was a fire burning speaking to her with a shy smile with an air of constraint which called to my mind the other little girl that gilberte must be when at home with her parents or with friends of her parents paying visits in all the rest that escaped me of her existence but of that existence no one gave me so strong an impression as did m swann who came a little later to fetch his daughter that was because he and mme swann inasmuch as their daughter lived with them as her lessons her games her friendships depended upon them contained for me like gilberte perhaps even more than gilberte as befitted subjects that had an all powerful control over her in whom it must have had its source an undefined an inaccessible quality of melancholy charm everything that concerned them was on my part the object of so constant a preoccupation that the days on which as on this day m swann whom i had seen so often long ago without his having aroused my curiosity when he was still on good terms with my parents came for gilberte to the champs elysées once the pulsations to which my heart had been excited by the appearance of his grey hat and hooded cape had subsided the sight of him still impressed me as might that of an historic personage upon whom one had just been studying a series of books and the smallest details of whose life one learned with enthusiasm his relations with the comte de paris which when i heard them discussed at combray seemed to me unimportant became now in my eyes something marvellous as if no one else had ever known the house of orleans they set him in vivid detachment against the vulgar background of pedestrians of different classes who encumbered that particular path in the champs elysées in the midst of whom i admired his condescending to figure without claiming any special deference which as it happened none of them dreamed of paying him so profound was the incognito in which he was wrapped he responded politely to the salutations of gilberte's companions even to mine for all that he was no longer on good terms with my family but without appearing to know who i was this reminded me that he had constantly seen me in the country a memory which i had retained but kept out of sight because since i had seen gilberte again swann had become to me pre eminently her father and no longer the combray swann as the ideas which nowadays i made his name connote were different from the ideas in the system of which it was formerly comprised which i utilised not at all now when i had occasion to think of him he had become a new another person still i attached him by an artificial thread secondary and transversal to our former guest and as nothing had any longer any value for me save in the extent to which my love might profit by it it was with a spasm of shame and of regret at not being able to erase them from my memory that i recaptured the years in which in the eyes of this same swann who was at this moment before me in the champs elysées and to whom fortunately gilberte had perhaps not mentioned my name i had so often in the evenings made myself ridiculous by sending to ask mamma to come upstairs to my room to say good night to me while she was drinking coffee with him and my father and my grandparents at the table in the garden he told gilberte that she might play one game he could wait for a quarter of an hour and sitting down just like anyone else on an iron chair paid for his ticket with that hand which philippe vii had so often held in his own while we began our game upon the lawn scattering the pigeons whose beautiful iridescent bodies shaped like hearts and surely the lilacs of the feathered kingdom took refuge as in so many sanctuaries one on the great basin of stone on which its beak as it disappeared below the rim conferred the part assigned the purpose of offering to the bird in abundance the fruit or grain at which it appeared to be pecking another on the head of the statue which it seemed to crown with one of those enamelled objects whose polychrome varies in certain classical works the monotony of the stone and with an attribute which when the goddess bears it entitles her to a particular epithet and makes of her as a different christian name makes of a mortal a fresh divinity on one of these sunny days which had not realised my hopes i had not the courage to conceal my disappointment from gilberte i had ever so many things to ask you i said to her i thought that to day was going to mean so much in our friendship and no sooner have you come than you go away try to come early to morrow so that i can talk to you her face lighted up and she jumped for joy as she answered tomorrow you may make up your mind my dear friend i sha'n't come first of all i've a big luncheon party then in the afternoon i am going to a friend's house to see king theodosius arrive from her windows won't that be splendid and then next day i'm going to michel strogoff and after that it will soon be christmas and the new year holidays perhaps they'll take me south to the riviera won't that be nice though i should miss the christmas tree here anyhow if i do stay in paris i sha'n't be coming here because i shall be out paying calls with mamma good bye there's papa calling me i returned home with françoise through streets that were still gay with sunshine as on the evening of a holiday when the merriment is over i could scarcely drag my legs along i'm not surprised said françoise it's not the right weather for the time of year it's much too warm oh dear oh dear to think of all the poor sick people there must be everywhere you would think that up there too everything's got out of order i repeated to myself stifling my sobs the words in which gilberte had given utterance to her joy at the prospect of not coming back for a long time to the champs elysées but already the charm with which by the mere act of thinking my mind was filled as soon as it thought of her the privileged position unique even if it were painful in which i was inevitably placed in relation to gilberte by the contraction of a scar in my mind had begun to add to that very mark of her indifference something romantic and in the midst of my tears my lips would shape themselves in a smile which was indeed the timid outline of a kiss and when the time came for the postman i said to myself that evening as on every other i am going to have a letter from gilberte she is going to tell me at last that she has never ceased to love me and to explain to me the mysterious reason by which she has been forced to conceal her love from me until now to put on the appearance of being able to be happy without seeing me the reason for which she has assumed the form of the other gilberte who is simply a companion every evening i would beguile myself into imagining this letter believing that i was actually reading it reciting each of its sentences in turn suddenly i would stop in alarm i had realised that if i was to receive a letter from gilberte it could not in any case be this letter since it was i myself who had just composed it and from that moment i would strive to keep my thoughts clear of the words which i should have liked her to write to me from fear lest by first selecting them myself i should be excluding just those identical words the dearest the most desired from the field of possible events even if by an almost impossible coincidence it had been precisely the letter of my invention that gilberte had addressed to me of her own accord recognising my own work in it i should not have had the impression that i was receiving something that had not originated in myself something real something new a happiness external to my mind independent of my will a gift indeed from love while i waited i read over again a page which although it had not been written to me by gilberte came to me none the less from her that page by bergotte upon the beauty of the old myths from which racine drew his inspiration which with the agate marble i always kept within reach i was touched by my friend's kindness in having procured the book for me and as everyone is obliged to find some reason for his passion so much so that he is glad to find in the creature whom he loves qualities which he has learned by reading or in conversation are worthy to excite a man's love that he assimilates them by imitation and makes out of them fresh reasons for his love even although these qualities be diametrically opposed to those for which his love would have sought so long as it was spontaneous as swann before my day had sought to establish the aesthetic basis of odette's beauty i who had at first loved gilberte in combray days on account of all the unknown element in her life into which i would fain have plunged headlong have undergone reincarnation discarding my own separate existence as a thing that no longer mattered i thought now as of an inestimable advantage that of this my own my too familiar my contemptible existence gilberte might one day become the humble servant the kindly the comforting collaborator who in the evenings helping me in my work would collate for me the texts of rare pamphlets as for bergotte that infinitely wise almost divine old man because of whom i had first before i had even seen her loved gilberte now it was for gilberte's sake chiefly that i loved him with as much pleasure as the pages that he had written about racine i studied the wrapper folded under great seals of white wax and tied with billows of pink ribbon in which she had brought those pages to me i kissed the agate marble which was the better part of my love's heart the part that was not frivolous but faithful and for all that it was adorned with the mysterious charm of gilberte's life dwelt close beside me inhabited my chamber shared my bed but the beauty of that stone and the beauty also of those pages of bergotte which i was glad to associate with the idea of my love for gilberte as if in the moments when my love seemed no longer to have any existence they gave it a kind of consistency were i perceived anterior to that love which they in no way resembled their elements had been determined by the writer's talent or by geological laws before ever gilberte had known me nothing in book or stone would have been different if gilberte had not loved me and there was nothing consequently that authorised me to read in them a message of happiness and while my love incessantly waiting for the morrow to bring a confession of gilberte's love for me destroyed unravelled every evening the ill done work of the day in some shadowed part of my being was an unknown weaver who would not leave where they lay the severed threads but collected and rearranged them without any thought of pleasing me or of toiling for my advantage in the different order which she gave to all her handiwork without any special interest in my love not beginning by deciding that i was loved she placed side by side those of gilberte's actions that had seemed to me inexplicable and her faults which i had excused then one with another they took on a meaning it seemed to tell me this new arrangement that when i saw gilberte instead of coming to me in the champs elysées going to a party or on errands with her governess when i saw her prepared for an absence that would extend over the new year holidays i was wrong in thinking in saying it is because she is frivolous or easily lead for she would have ceased to be either if she had loved me and if she had been forced to obey it would have been with the same despair in her heart that i felt on the days when i did not see her it shewed me further this new arrangement that i ought after all to know what it was to love since i loved gilberte it drew my attention to the constant anxiety that i had to 'shew off' before her by reason of which i tried to persuade my mother to get for françoise a waterproof coat and a hat with a blue feather or better still to stop sending with me to the champs elysées an attendant with whom i blushed to be seen to all of which my mother replied that i was not fair to françoise that she was an excellent woman and devoted to us all and also that sole exclusive need to see gilberte the result of which was that months in advance i could think of nothing but how to find out at what date she would be leaving paris and where she was going feeling that the most attractive country in the world would be but a place of exile if she were not to be there and asking only to be allowed to stay for ever in paris so long as i might see her in the champs elysées and it had little difficulty in making me see that neither my anxiety nor my need could be justified by anything in gilberte's conduct she on the contrary was genuinely fond of her governess without troubling herself over what i might choose to think about it it seemed quite natural to her not to come to the champs elysées if she had to go shopping with mademoiselle delightful if she had to go out somewhere with her mother and even supposing that she would ever have allowed me to spend my holidays in the same place as herself when it came to choosing that place she considered her parents' wishes a thousand different amusements of which she had been told and not at all that it should be the place to which my family were proposing to send me when she assured me as sometimes happened that she liked me less than some other of her friends less than she had liked me the day before because by my clumsiness i had made her side lose a game i would beg her pardon i would beg her to tell me what i must do in order that she should begin again to like me as much as or more than the rest i hoped to hear her say that that was already my position i besought her as though she had been able to modify her affection for me as she or i chose to give me pleasure merely by the words that she would utter as my good or bad conduct should deserve was i then not yet aware that what i felt myself for her depended neither upon her actions nor upon my desires it shewed me finally the new arrangement planned by my unseen weaver that if we find ourselves hoping that the actions of a person who has hitherto caused us anxiety may prove not to have been sincere they shed in their wake a light which our hopes are powerless to extinguish a light to which rather than to our hopes we must put the question what will be that person's actions on the morrow these new counsels my love listened and heard them they persuaded it that the morrow would not be different from all the days that had gone before that gilberte's feeling for me too long established now to be capable of alteration was indifference that in my friendship with gilberte it was i alone who loved that is true my love responded there is nothing more to be made of that friendship it will not alter now and so the very next day unless i were to wait for a public holiday if there was one approaching some anniversary the new year perhaps one of those days which are not like other days on which time starts afresh casting aside the heritage of the past declining its legacy of sorrows i would appeal to gilberte to terminate our old and to join me in laying the foundations of a new friendship i had always within reach a plan of paris which because i could see drawn on it the street in which m and mme swann lived seemed to me to contain a secret treasure and to please myself as well as by a sort of chivalrous loyalty in any connection or with no relevance at all i would repeat the name of that street until my father not being like my mother and grandmother in the secret of my love would ask but why are you always talking about that street there's nothing wonderful about it it is an admirable street to live in because it's only a few minutes' walk from the bois but there are a dozen other streets just the same i made every effort to introduce the name of swann into my conversation with my parents in my own mind of course i never ceased to murmur it but i needed also to hear its exquisite sound and to make myself play that chord the voiceless rendering of which did not suffice me moreover that name of swann with which i had for so long been familiar was to me now as happens at times to people suffering from aphasia in the case of the most ordinary words the name of something new it was for ever present in my mind which could not however grow accustomed to it i analysed it i spelt it its orthography came to me as a surprise and with its familiarity it had simultaneously lost its innocence the pleasure that i derived from the sound of it i felt to be so guilty that it seemed to me as though the others must read my thoughts and would change the conversation if i endeavoured to guide it in that direction i fell back upon subjects which still brought me into touch with gilberte i eternally repeated the same words and it was no use my knowing that they were but words words uttered in her absence which she could not hear words without virtue in themselves repeating what were indeed facts but powerless to modify them for still it seemed to me that by dint of handling of stirring in this way everything that had reference to gilberte i might perhaps make emerge from it something that would bring me happiness i told my parents again that gilberte was very fond of her governess as if the statement when repeated for the hundredth time would at last have the effect of making gilberte suddenly burst into the room come to live with us for ever i had already sung the praises of the old lady who read the débats i had hinted to my parents that she must at least be an ambassador's widow if not actually a highness and i continued to descant on her beauty her splendour her nobility until the day on which i mentioned that by what i had heard gilberte call her she appeared to be a mme blatin oh now i know whom you mean cried my mother while i felt myself grow red all over with shame on guard on guard as your grandfather says and so it's she that you think so wonderful why she's perfectly horrible and always has been she's the widow of a bailiff you can't remember when you were little all the trouble i used to have to avoid her at your gymnastic lessons where she was always trying to get hold of me i didn't know the woman of course to tell me that you were 'much too nice looking for a boy ' she has always had an insane desire to get to know people and she must be quite insane as i have always thought if she really does know mme swann for even if she does come of very common people i have never heard anything said against her character but she must always be forcing herself upon strangers she is really a horrible woman frightfully vulgar and besides she is always creating awkward situations as for swann in my attempts to resemble him i spent the whole time when i was at table in drawing my finger along my nose and in rubbing my eyes my father would exclaim the child's a perfect idiot he's becoming quite impossible more than all else i should have liked to be as bald as swann he appeared to me to be a creature so extraordinary that i found it impossible to believe that people whom i knew and often saw knew him also and that in the course of the day anyone might run against him and once my mother while she was telling us as she did every evening at dinner where she had been and what she had done that afternoon merely by the words by the way guess whom i saw at the trois quartiers at the umbrella counter swann caused to burst open in the midst of her narrative an arid desert to me a mystic blossom what a melancholy satisfaction to learn that that very afternoon threading through the crowd his supernatural form swann had gone to buy an umbrella among the events of the day great and small but all equally unimportant that one alone aroused in me those peculiar vibrations by which my love for gilberte was invariably stirred my father complained that i took no interest in anything because i did not listen while he was speaking of the political developments that might follow the visit of king theodosius at that moment in france as the nation's guest and it was hinted ally and yet how intensely interested i was to know whether swann had been wearing his hooded cape did you speak to him i asked why of course i did answered my mother who always seemed afraid lest were she to admit that we were not on the warmest of terms with swann people would seek to reconcile us more than she cared for in view of the existence of mme swann whom she did not wish to know it was he who came up and spoke to me i hadn't seen him then you haven't quarrelled quarrelled what on earth made you think that we had quarrelled she briskly parried as though i had cast doubt on the fiction of her friendly relations with swann and was planning an attempt to 'bring them together ' he might be cross with you for never asking him here one isn't obliged to ask everyone to one's house you know has he ever asked me to his i don't know his wife but he used often to come at combray i should think he did he used to come at combray and now in paris he has something better to do and so have i but i can promise you we didn't look in the least like people who had quarrelled we were kept waiting there for some time while they brought him his parcel he asked after you he told me you had been playing with his daughter my mother went on amazing me with the portentous revelation of my own existence in swann's mind far more than that of my existence in so complete so material a form that when i stood before him trembling with love in the champs elysées he had known my name and who my mother was and had been able to blend with my quality as his daughter's playmate certain facts with regard to my grandparents and their connections the place in which we lived certain details of our past life all of which i myself perhaps did not know but my mother did not seem to have noticed anything particularly attractive in that counter at the trois quartiers where she had represented to swann at the moment in which he caught sight of her a definite person with whom he had sufficient memories in common to impel him to come up to her and to speak nor did either she or my father seem to find any occasion now to mention swann's family the grandparents of gilberte nor to use the title of stockbroker topics than which nothing else gave me so keen a pleasure my imagination had isolated and consecrated in the social paris a certain family just as it had set apart in the structural paris a certain house on whose porch it had fashioned sculptures and made its windows precious but these ornaments i alone had eyes to see just as my father and mother looked upon the house in which swann lived as one that closely resembled the other houses built at the same period in the neighbourhood of the bois so swann's family seemed to them to be in the same category as many other families of stockbrokers their judgment was more or less favourable according to the extent to which the family in question shared in merits that were common to the rest of the universe and there was about it nothing that they could call unique what on the other hand they did appreciate in the swanns they found in equal if not in greater measure elsewhere and so after admitting that the house was in a good position they would go on to speak of some other house that was in a better but had nothing to do with gilberte or of financiers on a larger scale than her grandfather had been and if they had appeared for a moment to be of my opinion that was a mistake which was very soon corrected for in order to distinguish in all gilberte's surroundings an indefinable quality analogous in the scale of emotions to what in the scale of colours is called infra red a supplementary sense of perception was required with which love for the time being had endowed me and this my parents lacked on the days when gilberte had warned me that she would not be coming to the champs elysées i would try to arrange my walks so that i should be brought into some kind of contact with her sometimes i would lead françoise on a pilgrimage to the house in which the swanns lived making her repeat to me unendingly all that she had learned from the governess with regard to mme swann it seems she puts great faith in medals she would never think of starting on a journey if she had heard an owl hoot or the death watch in the wall or if she had seen a cat at midnight or if the furniture had creaked oh yes she's a most religious lady she is i was so madly in love with gilberte that if on our way i caught sight of their old butler taking the dog out my emotion would bring me to a standstill i would fasten on his white whiskers eyes that melted with passion and françoise would rouse me with what's wrong with you now child and we would continue on our way until we reached their gate where a porter different from every other porter in the world and saturated even to the braid on his livery with the same melancholy charm that i had felt to be latent in the name of gilberte looked at me as though he knew that i was one of those whose natural unworthiness would for ever prevent them from penetrating into the mysteries of the life inside which it was his duty to guard and over which the ground floor windows appeared conscious of being protectingly closed with far less resemblance between the nobly sweeping arches of their muslin curtains to any other windows in the world than to gilberte's glancing eyes on other days we would go along the boulevards and i would post myself at the corner of the rue duphot i had heard that swann was often to be seen passing there on his way to the dentist's and my imagination so far differentiated gilberte's father from the rest of humanity his presence in the midst of a crowd of real people introduced among them so miraculous an element that even before we reached the madeleine i would be trembling with emotion at the thought that i was approaching a street from which that supernatural apparition might at any moment burst upon me unawares but most often of all on days when i was not to see gilberte as i had heard that mme swann walked almost every day along the allée des acacias round the big lake and in the allée de la reine marguerite i would guide françoise in the direction of the bois de boulogne it was to me like one of those zoological gardens in which one sees assembled together a variety of flora and contrasted effects in landscape where from a hill one passes to a grotto a meadow rocks a stream a trench another hill a marsh but knows that they are there only to enable the hippopotamus zebra crocodile rabbit bear and heron to disport themselves in a natural or a picturesque setting this the bois equally complex uniting a multitude of little worlds distinct and separate placing a stage set with red trees american oaks like an experimental forest in virginia next to a fir wood by the edge of the lake or to a forest grove from which would suddenly emerge in her lissom covering of furs with the large appealing eyes of a dumb animal a hastening walker was the garden of woman and like the myrtle alley in the aeneid planted for their delight with trees of one kind only the allée des acacias was thronged by the famous beauties of the day as from a long way off the sight of the jutting crag from which it dives into the pool thrills with joy the children who know that they are going to behold the seal long before i reached the acacia alley their fragrance scattered abroad would make me feel that i was approaching the incomparable presence of a vegetable personality strong and tender then as i drew near the sight of their topmost branches their lightly tossing foliage in its easy grace its coquettish outline its delicate fabric over which hundreds of flowers were laid like winged and throbbing colonies of precious insects and finally their name itself feminine indolent and seductive made my heart beat but with a social longing like those waltzes which remind us only of the names of the fair dancers called aloud as they entered the ball room i had been told that i should see in the alley certain women of fashion who in spite of their not all having husbands were constantly mentioned in conjunction with mme swann but most often by their professional names their new names when they had any being but a sort of incognito a veil which those who would speak of them were careful to draw aside so as to make themselves understood thinking that beauty in the order of feminine elegance was governed by occult laws into the knowledge of which they had been initiated and that they had the power to realise it i accepted before seeing them like the truth of a coming revelation the appearance of their clothes of their carriages and horses of a thousand details among which i placed my faith as in an inner soul which gave the cohesion of a work of art to that ephemeral and changing pageant but it was mme swann whom i wished to see and i waited for her to go past as deeply moved as though she were gilberte whose parents saturated like everything in her environment with her own special charm excited in me as keen a passion as she did herself indeed a still more painful disturbance since their point of contact with her was that intimate that internal part of her life which was hidden from me and furthermore for i very soon learned as we shall see in due course that they did not like my playing with her that feeling of veneration which we always have for those who hold and exercise without restraint the power to do us an injury i assigned the first place in the order of aesthetic merit and of social grandeur to simplicity when i saw mme swann on foot in a 'polonaise' of plain cloth a little toque on her head trimmed with a pheasant's wing a bunch of violets in her bosom hastening along the allée des acacias as if it had been merely the shortest way back to her own house and acknowledging with a rapid glance the courtesy of the gentlemen in carriages who recognising her figure at a distance were raising their hats to her and saying to one another that there was never anyone so well turned out as she but instead of simplicity it was to ostentation that i must assign the first place if after i had compelled françoise who could hold out no longer and complained that her legs were 'giving' beneath her to stroll up and down with me for another hour i saw at length emerging from the porte dauphine figuring for me a royal dignity the passage of a sovereign an impression such as no real queen has ever since been able to give me because my notion of their power has been less vague and more founded upon experience borne along by the flight of a pair of fiery horses slender and shapely as one sees them in the drawings of constantin guys carrying on its box an enormous coachman furred like a cossack and by his side a diminutive groom like toby the late beaudenord's tiger i saw or rather i felt its outlines engraved upon my heart by a clean and killing stab a matchless victoria built rather high and hinting through the extreme modernity of its appointments at the forms of an earlier day deep down in which lay negligently back mme swann her hair now quite pale with one grey lock girt with a narrow band of flowers usually violets from which floated down long veils a lilac parasol in her hand on her lips an ambiguous smile in which i read only the benign condescension of majesty though it was pre eminently the enticing smile of the courtesan which she graciously bestowed upon the men who bowed to her that smile was in reality saying to one oh yes i do remember quite well it was wonderful to another how i should have loved to we were unfortunate to a third yes if you like i must just keep in the line for a minute then as soon as i can i will break away when strangers passed she still allowed to linger about her lips a lazy smile as though she expected or remembered some friend which made them say what a lovely woman and for certain men only she had a sour strained shy cold smile which meant yes you old goat i know that you've got a tongue like a viper that you can't keep quiet for a moment but do you suppose that i care what you say coquelin passed talking in a group of listening friends and with a sweeping wave of his hand bade a theatrical good day to the people in the carriages but i thought only of mme swann and pretended to have not yet seen her for i knew that when she reached the pigeon shooting ground she would tell her coachman to 'break away' and to stop the carriage so that she might come back on foot and on days when i felt that i had the courage to pass close by her i would drag françoise off in that direction until the moment came when i saw mme swann letting trail behind her the long train of her lilac skirt dressed as the populace imagine queens to be dressed in rich attire such as no other woman might wear lowering her eyes now and then to study the handle of her parasol paying scant attention to the passers by as though the important thing for her her one object in being there was to take exercise without thinking that she was seen and that every head was turned towards her sometimes however when she had looked back to call her dog to her she would cast almost imperceptibly a sweeping glance round about those even who did not know her were warned by something exceptional something beyond the normal in her or perhaps by a telepathic suggestion such as would move an ignorant audience to a frenzy of applause when berma was 'sublime' that she must be some one well known they would ask one another who is she or sometimes would interrogate a passing stranger or would make a mental note of how she was dressed so as to fix her identity later in the mind of a friend better informed than themselves who would at once enlighten them another pair half stopping in their walk would exchange you know who that is mme swann that conveys nothing to you odette de crécy then odette de crécy why i thought as much those great sad eyes but i say you know she can't be as young as she was once eh i remember i had her on the day that macmahon went i shouldn't remind her of it if i were you she is now mme swann the wife of a gentleman in the jockey club a friend of the prince of wales apart from that though she is wonderful still oh but you ought to have known her then gad she was lovely she lived in a very odd little house with a lot of chinese stuff i remember we were bothered all the time by the newsboys shouting outside in the end she made me get up and go without listening to these memories i could feel all about her the indistinct murmur of fame my heart leaped with impatience when i thought that a few seconds must still elapse before all these people among whom i was dismayed not to find a certain mulatto banker who or so i felt had a contempt for me were to see the unknown youth to whom they had not so far been paying the slightest attention salute without knowing her it was true but i thought that i had sufficient authority since my parents knew her husband and i was her daughter's playmate this woman whose reputation for beauty for misconduct and for elegance was universal but i was now close to mme swann i pulled off my hat with so lavish so prolonged a gesture that she could not repress a smile people laughed as for her she had never seen me with gilberte she did not know my name but i was for her like one of the keepers in the bois like the boatman or the ducks on the lake to which she threw scraps of bread one of the minor personages familiar nameless as devoid of individual character as a stage hand in a theatre of her daily walks abroad on certain days when i had missed her in the allée des acacias i would be so fortunate as to meet her in the allée de la reine marguerite where women went who wished to be alone or to appear to be wishing to be alone she would not be alone for long being soon overtaken by some man or other often in a grey 'tile' hat whom i did not know and who would talk to her for some time while their two carriages crawled behind that sense of the complexity of the bois de boulogne which made it an artificial place and in the zoological or mythological sense of the word a garden i captured again this year as i crossed it on my way to trianon on one of those mornings early in november when in paris if we stay indoors being so near and yet prevented from witnessing the transformation scene of autumn which is drawing so rapidly to a close without our assistance we feel a regret for the fallen leaves that becomes a fever and may even keep us awake at night into my closed room they had been drifting already for a month summoned there by my desire to see them slipping between my thoughts and the object whatever it might be upon which i was trying to concentrate them whirling in front of me like those brown spots that sometimes whatever we may be looking at will seem to be dancing or swimming before our eyes and on that morning not hearing the splash of the rain as on the previous days seeing the smile of fine weather at the corners of my drawn curtains as from the corners of closed lips may escape the secret of their happiness i had felt that i could actually see those yellow leaves with the light shining through them in their supreme beauty and being no more able to restrain myself from going to look at the trees than in my childhood's days when the wind howled in the chimney i had been able to resist the longing to visit the sea i had risen and left the house to go to trianon passing through the bois de boulogne it was the hour and the season in which the bois seems perhaps most multiform not only because it is then most divided but because it is divided in a different way even in the unwooded parts where the horizon is large here and there against the background of a dark and distant mass of trees now leafless or still keeping their summer foliage unchanged a double row of orange red chestnuts seemed as in a picture just begun to be the only thing painted so far by an artist who had not yet laid any colour on the rest and to be offering their cloister in full daylight for the casual exercise of the human figures that would be added to the picture later on farther off at a place where the trees were still all green one alone small stunted lopped but stubborn in its resistance was tossing in the breeze an ugly mane of red elsewhere again might be seen the first awakening of this maytime of the leaves and those of an ampelopsis a smiling miracle like a red hawthorn flowering in winter had that very morning all 'come out ' so to speak in blossom and the bois had the temporary unfinished artificial look of a nursery garden or a park in which either for some botanic purpose or in preparation for a festival there have been embedded among the trees of commoner growth which have not yet been uprooted and transplanted elsewhere a few rare specimens with fantastic foliage which seem to be clearing all round themselves an empty space making room giving air diffusing light thus it was the time of year at which the bois de boulogne displays more separate characteristics assembles more distinct elements in a composite whole than at any other it was also the time of day in places where the trees still kept their leaves they seemed to have undergone an alteration of their substance from the point at which they were touched by the sun's light still at this hour in the morning almost horizontal as it would be again a few hours later at the moment when just as dusk began it would flame up like a lamp project afar over the leaves a warm and artificial glow and set ablaze the few topmost boughs of a tree that would itself remain unchanged a sombre incombustible candelabrum beneath its flaming crest at one spot the light grew solid as a brick wall and like a piece of yellow persian masonry patterned in blue daubed coarsely upon the sky the leaves of the chestnuts at another it cut them off from the sky towards which they stretched out their curling golden fingers half way up the trunk of a tree draped with wild vine the light had grafted and brought to blossom too dazzling to be clearly distinguished an enormous posy of red flowers apparently perhaps of a new variety of carnation the different parts of the bois so easily confounded in summer in the density and monotony of their universal green were now clearly divided a patch of brightness indicated the approach to almost every one of them or else a splendid mass of foliage stood out before it like an oriflamme i could make out as on a coloured map armenonville the pré catalan madrid the race course and the shore of the lake here and there would appear some meaningless erection a sham grotto a mill for which the trees made room by drawing away from it or which was borne upon the soft green platform of a grassy lawn i could feel that the bois was not really a wood that it existed for a purpose alien to the life of its trees my sense of exaltation was due not only to admiration of the autumn tints but to a bodily desire ample source of a joy which the heart feels at first without being conscious of its cause without understanding that it results from no external impulse thus i gazed at the trees with an unsatisfied longing which went beyond them and without my knowledge directed itself towards that masterpiece of beautiful strolling women which the trees enframed for a few hours every day i walked towards the allée des acacias i passed through forest groves in which the morning light breaking them into new sections lopped and trimmed the trees united different trunks in marriage made nosegays of their branches it would skilfully draw towards it a pair of trees making deft use of the sharp chisel of light and shade it would cut away from each of them half of its trunk and branches and weaving together the two halves that remained would make of them either a single pillar of shade defined by the surrounding light or a single luminous phantom whose artificial quivering contour was encompassed in a network of inky shadows when a ray of sunshine gilded the highest branches they seemed soaked and still dripping with a sparkling moisture to have emerged alone from the liquid emerald green atmosphere in which the whole grove was plunged as though beneath the sea for the trees continued to live by their own vitality and when they had no longer any leaves that vitality gleamed more brightly still from the nap of green velvet that carpeted their trunks or in the white enamel of the globes of mistletoe that were scattered all the way up to the topmost branches of the poplars rounded as are the sun and moon in michelangelo's 'creation ' but forced for so many years now by a sort of grafting process to share the life of feminine humanity they called to my mind the figure of the dryad the fair worldling swiftly walking brightly coloured whom they sheltered with their branches as she passed beneath them and obliged to acknowledge as they themselves acknowledged the power of the season they recalled to me the happy days when i was young and had faith when i would hasten eagerly to the spots where masterpieces of female elegance would be incarnate for a few moments beneath the unconscious accommodating boughs but the beauty for which the firs and acacias of the bois de boulogne made me long more disquieting in that respect than the chestnuts and lilacs of trianon which i was going to see was not fixed somewhere outside myself in the relics of an historical period in works of art in a little temple of love at whose door was piled an oblation of autumn leaves ribbed with gold i reached the shore of the lake i walked on as far as the pigeon shooting ground the idea of perfection which i had within me i had bestowed in that other time upon the height of a victoria upon the raking thinness of those horses frenzied and light as wasps upon the wing with bloodshot eyes like the cruel steeds of diomed which now smitten by a desire to see again what i had once loved as ardent as the desire that had driven me many years before along the same paths i wished to see renewed before my eyes at the moment when mme swann's enormous coachman supervised by a groom no bigger than his fist and as infantile as saint george in the picture endeavoured to curb the ardour of the flying steel tipped pinions with which they thundered along the ground alas there was nothing now but motor cars driven each by a moustached mechanic with a tall footman towering by his side i wished to hold before my bodily eyes that i might know whether they were indeed as charming as they appeared to the eyes of memory little hats so low crowned as to seem no more than garlands about the brows of women all the hats now were immense covered with fruits and flowers and all manner of birds in place of the lovely gowns in which mme swann walked like a queen appeared greco saxon tunics with tanagra folds or sometimes in the directoire style 'liberty chiffons' sprinkled with flowers like sheets of wallpaper on the heads of the gentlemen who might have been eligible to stroll with mme swann in the allée de la reine marguerite i found not the grey 'tile' hats of old nor any other kind they walked the bois bare headed and seeing all these new elements of the spectacle i had no longer the faith which applied to them would have given them consistency unity life they passed in a scattered sequence before me at random without reality containing in themselves no beauty that my eyes might have endeavoured as in the old days to extract from them and to compose in a picture they were just women in whose elegance i had no belief and whose clothes seemed to me unimportant but when a belief vanishes there survives it more and more ardently so as to cloak the absence of the power now lost to us of imparting reality to new phenomena an idolatrous attachment to the old things which our belief in them did once animate as if it was in that belief and not in ourselves that the divine spark resided and as if our present incredulity had a contingent cause the death of the gods oh horrible i exclaimed to myself does anyone really imagine that these motor cars are as smart as the old carriage and pair i dare say i am too old now but i was not intended for a world in which women shackle themselves in garments that are not even made of cloth to what purpose shall i walk among these trees if there is nothing left now of the assembly that used to meet beneath the delicate tracery of reddening leaves if vulgarity and fatuity have supplanted the exquisite thing that once their branches framed oh horrible my consolation is to think of the women whom i have known in the past now that there is no standard left of elegance but how can the people who watch these dreadful creatures hobble by beneath hats on which have been heaped the spoils of aviary or garden bed how can they imagine the charm that there was in the sight of mme swann crowned with a close fitting lilac bonnet or with a tiny hat from which rose stiffly above her head a single iris could i ever have made them understand the emotion that i used to feel on winter mornings when i met mme swann on foot in an otter skin coat with a woollen cap from which stuck out two blade like partridge feathers but enveloped also in the deliberate artificial warmth of her own house which was suggested by nothing more than the bunch of violets crushed into her bosom whose flowering vivid and blue against the grey sky the freezing air the naked boughs had the same charming effect of using the season and the weather merely as a setting and of living actually in a human atmosphere in the atmosphere of this woman as had in the vases and beaupots of her drawing room beside the blazing fire in front of the silk covered sofa the flowers that looked out through closed windows at the falling snow but it would not have sufficed me that the costumes alone should still have been the same as in those distant years because of the solidarity that binds together the different parts of a general impression parts that our memory keeps in a balanced whole of which we are not permitted to subtract or to decline any fraction i should have liked to be able to pass the rest of the day with one of those women over a cup of tea in a little house with dark painted walls as mme swann's were still in the year after that in which the first part of this story ends against which would glow the orange flame the red combustion the pink and white flickering of her chrysanthemums in the twilight of a november evening in moments similar to those in which as we shall see i had not managed to discover the pleasures for which i longed but now albeit they had led to nothing those moments struck me as having been charming enough in themselves i sought to find them again as i remembered them alas there was nothing now but flats decorated in the louis xvi style all white paint with hortensias in blue enamel moreover people did not return to paris now until much later mme swann would have written to me from a country house that she would not be in town before february had i asked her to reconstruct for me the elements of that memory which i felt to belong to a distant era to a date in time towards which it was forbidden me to ascend again the fatal slope the elements of that longing which had become itself as inaccessible as the pleasure that it had once vainly pursued and i should have required also that they be the same women those whose costume interested me because at a time when i still had faith my imagination had individualised them and had provided each of them with a legend alas in the acacia avenue the myrtle alley i did see some of them again grown old no more now than grim spectres of what once they had been wandering to and fro in desperate search of heaven knew what through the virgilian groves they had long fled and still i stood vainly questioning the deserted paths the sun's face was hidden nature began again to reign over the bois from which had vanished all trace of the idea that it was the elysian garden of woman above the gimcrack windmill the real sky was grey the wind wrinkled the surface of the grand lac in little wavelets like a real lake large birds passed swiftly over the bois as over a real wood and with shrill cries perched one after another on the great oaks which beneath their druidical crown and with dodonaic majesty seemed to proclaim the unpeopled vacancy of this estranged forest and helped me to understand how paradoxical it is to seek in reality for the pictures that are stored in one's memory which must inevitably lose the charm that comes to them from memory itself and from their not being apprehended by the senses the reality that i had known no longer existed it sufficed that mme swann did not appear in the same attire and at the same moment for the whole avenue to be altered the places that we have known belong now only to the little world of space on which we map them for our own convenience none of them was ever more than a thin slice held between the contiguous impressions that composed our life at that time remembrance of a particular form is but regret for a particular moment and houses roads avenues are as fugitive alas as the years end of the project gutenberg ebook of swann's way by marcel proust end of this project

of this project gutenberg ebook the night land produced by suzanne shell maria khomenko and pg distributed proofreaders the night land william hope hodgson 1912 the dreams that are only dreams this to be love that your spirit to live in a natural holiness with the beloved and your bodies to be a sweet and natural delight that shall be never lost of a lovely mystery and shame to be unborn and all things to go wholesome and proper out of an utter greatness of understanding and the man to be an hero and a child before the woman and the woman to be an holy light of the spirit and an utter companion and in the same time a glad possession unto the man and this doth be human love for this to be the especial glory of love that it doth make unto all sweetness and greatness and doth be a fire burning all littleness so that did all in this world to have met the beloved then did wantonness be dead and there to grow gladness and charity dancing in the years i mirdath the beautiful and i cannot touch her face and i cannot touch her hair and i kneel to empty shadows just memories of her grace and her voice sings in the winds and in the sobs of dawn and among the flowers at night and from the brooks at sunrise and from the sea at sunset and i answer with vain callings it was the joy of the sunset that brought us to speech i was gone a long way from my house walking lonely wise and stopping often that i view the piling upward of the battlements of evening and to feel the dear and strange gathering of the dusk come over all the world about me the last time that i paused i was truly lost in a solemn joy of the glory of the coming night and maybe i laughed a little in my throat standing there alone in the midst of the dusk upon the world and lo my content was answered out of the trees that bounded the country road upon my right and it was so as that some one had said and thou also in glad understanding that i laughed again a little in my throat as though i had only a half believing that any true human did answer my laugh but rather some sweet delusion or spirit that was tuned to my mood but she spoke and called me by my name and when i had gone to the side of the road that i should see her somewhat and discover whether i knew her i saw that she was surely that lady who for her beauty was known through all of that sweet county of kent as lady mirdath the beautiful and a near neighbour to me for the estates of her guardian abounded upon mine yet until that time i had never met her for i had been so oft and long abroad and so much given to my studies and my exercises when at home that i had no further knowledge of her than rumour gave to me odd time and for the rest i was well content for as i have given hint my books held me and likewise my exercises for i was always an athlete and never met the man so quick or so strong as i did be save in some fiction of a tale or in the mouth of a boaster now i stood instantly with my hat in my hand and answered her gentle bantering so well as i might the while that i peered intent and wondering at her through the gloom for truly rumour had told no tale to equal the beauty of this strange maid who now stood jesting with so sweet a spirit and claiming kinship of cousinhood with me as was truth now that i did wake to think and truly she made no ado but named me frank by my lad's name and gave laughter and right to me to name her mirdath and nothing less or more at that time and she bid me then to come up through the hedge and make use of a gap that was her own especial secret as she confessed when she took odd leave with her maid to some country frolic drest as village maids but not to deceive many as i dare believe and i came up through the gap in the hedge and stood beside her and tall she had seemed to me when i looked up at her and tall she was in truth but indeed i was a great head taller and she invited me then to walk with her to the house that i meet her guardian and give word to my sorrow that i had so long neglected to make call upon them and truly her eyes to shine with mischief and delight as she named me so for my amissness but indeed she grew sober in a moment and she set up her finger to me to hush as that she heard somewhat in the wood that lay all the way upon our right and indeed something i heard too for there was surely a rustling of the leaves and anon a dead twig crackt with a sound clear and sharp in the stillness and immediately there came three men running out of the wood at me and i called to them sharply to keep off or beware of harm and i put the maid to my back with my left hand and had my oak staff ready for my use but the three men gave out no word of reply but ran in at me and i saw somewhat of the gleam of knives and at that i moved very glad and brisk to the attack and behind me there went shrill and sweet the call of a silver whistle for the maid was whistling for her dogs and maybe the call was also a signal to the men servants of her house yet truly there was no use in help that was yet to come for the need did be then and instant and i nowise loath to use my strength before my sweet cousin and i stepped forward briskly as i have told and the end of my staff i drove into the body of the left ward man so that he dropped like a dead man and i hit very sharply at the head of another and surely crackt it for him for he made instantly upon the earth but the third man i met with my fist and neither had he any great need of a second blow but went instant to join his companions and the fight thus to have ended before it was even proper begun and i laughing a little with a proper pride to know the bewilderment that i perceived in the way that the lady mirdath my cousin stood and regarded me through the dusk of the hushed even but indeed there was no time left to us before there came bounding up three great boar hounds that had been loosed to her whistle and she had some ado to keep the brutes off me and i then to beat them off the men upon the earth lest they maul them as they lay and directly there was a noise of men shouting and the light of lanthorns in the night and the footmen of the house to come running with lanthorns and cudgels and knew not whether to deal with me or not in the first moment even as the dogs but when they saw the men upon the ground and learned my name and saw me proper they kept well their distance and had no lack of respect but indeed my sweet cousin to have the most of any only that she showed no intent to keep distance of me but to have a new and deeper feeling of kinship than she at first had shown and the men servants asked what should be done with the foot pads seeing that they were now recovering but indeed i left the matter along with some silver to the servants and very sound justice they dealt out to the men for i heard their cries a good while after we had gone away now when we were come up to the hall my cousin must take me in to her guardian sir alfred jarles an old man and venerable that i knew a little in passing and because our estates abounded and she praised me to my face yet quaintly wise and the old man her guardian thanked me most honourably and with a nice courtesy so that i was a welcome house friend from that time onward and i stayed all that evening and dined and afterward went out again into the home grounds with the lady mirdath and she more friendly to me than ever any woman had been and seemed to me as that she had known me always and truly i had the same feeling in my heart towards her for it was somehow as though we knew each the way and turn of the other and had a constant delight to find this thing and that thing to be in common but no surprise save that so pleasant a truth had so natural a discovery and one thing there was that i perceived held the lady mirdath all that dear fore night and this was indeed the way that i had my pleasure so easy with the three foot pads and she asked me plainly whether i was not truly very strong and when i laughed with young and natural pride she caught my arm suddenly to discover for herself how strong i might be and surely she loosed it even the more sudden and with a little gasping of astonishment because it was so great and hard and afterward she walked by me very silent and seeming thoughtful but she went never any great way off from me and truly if the lady mirdath had a strange pleasure in my strength i had likewise a constant wonder and marvel in her beauty that had shown but the more lovely in the candle light at dinner but there were further delights to me in the days that came for i had happiness in the way that she had pleasure of the mystery of the evening and the glamour of night and the joy of dawn and all suchlike and one evening that i ever remember as we wandered in the park lands she began to say half unthinking that it was truly an elves night and she stopped herself immediately as though she thought i should have no understanding but indeed i was upon mine own familiar ground of inward delight and i replied in a quiet and usual voice that the towers of sleep would grow that night and i felt in my bones that it was a night to find the giant's tomb or the tree with the great painted head or and surely i stopped very sudden for she gripped me in that moment and her hand shook as she held me but when i would ask her what ailed she bid me very breathless to say on to say on and with a half understanding i told her that i had but meant to speak of the moon garden that was an olden and happy fancy of mine and in verity when i said that the lady mirdath cried out something in a strange low voice and brought me to a halt that she might face me and she questioned me very earnest and i answered just so earnest as she for i was grown suddenly to an excitement in that i perceived she knew also and in verity she told me that she had knowledge but had thought that she was alone in the world with her knowledge of that strange land of her dreams and now to find that i also had travelled in those dear strange dream lands and truly the marvel of it the marvel of it as she to say time and oft and again as we walked she gave out word that there was little wonder she had been urged to call to me that night as she saw me pause upon the road though indeed she had learned of our cousin ship before having seen me go by on my horse pretty oft and inquired concerning me and mayhap daintily irked that i had so little heed of lady mirdath the beautiful but indeed i had thought of other matters yet had been human enough had i but met her proper before i see her now you must not think that i was not utter stirred by the wonder of this thing that we had both a dreamful knowledge of the same matters of which each had thought none other knew yet when i questioned more there was much that had been in my fancies that was foreign to her and likewise much that had been familiar to her that was of no meaning to me but though there was this that brought a little regret to us there would be time and again some new thing that one told that the other knew and could finish the telling of to the gladness and amazement of both and so shall you picture us wandering and having constant speech so that hour by hour we grew gladly aged in dear knowledge and sweet friendship of the other and truly how the time passed i know not but there came presently a hullabaloo and the shouts of men's voices and the baying of dogs and the gleam of lanthorns so that i knew not what to think until very sudden and with a sweet and strange little laughter the lady mirdath to perceive that we had missed the hours utter in our converse so that her guardian made uneasy because of the three foot pads had ordered a search and we all that time a wander together in happy forgetfulness and we turned homeward then and came towards the lights but indeed the dogs found us before we were come there and they had grown to know me now and leaped about me barking very friendly and so in a minute the men had discovered us and were gone back to tell sir jarles that all was well and this was the way of our meeting and the growing of our acquaintance and the beginning of my great love for mirdath the beautiful now from that time onward evening by evening would i go a wander along the quiet and country road that led from my estate to the estate of sir jarles and always i went inward by the hedge gap and oft i should find the lady mirdath walking in that part of the woods but always with her great boar hounds about her for i had begged that she do this thing for her sweet safety and she to seem wishful to pleasure me but truly to be just so oft utter perverse in diverse matters and to strive to plague me as though she would discover how much i would endure and how far she might go to anger me and truly well i remember how that one night coming to the hedge gap i saw two country maids come thence out from the woods of sir jarles' but they were naught to me and i would have gone upward through the gap as ever only that as they passed me they curtseyed somewhat over graceful for rough wenches and i had a sudden thought and came up to them to see them more anigh and truly i thought the taller was surely the lady mirdath but indeed i could not be sure for when i asked who she did be she only to simper and to curtsey again and so was i very natural all in doubt but yet sufficient in wonder having some knowledge of the lady mirdath to follow the wenches the which i did and they then very speedy and sedate as though i were some rack rape that they did well to be feared of alone at night and so came at last to the village green where a great dance was a foot with torches and a wandering fiddler to set the tune and ale in plenty and the two to join the dance and danced very hearty but had only each the other for a partner and had a good care to avoid the torches and by this i was pretty sure that they were truly the lady mirdath and her maid and so i took chance when they had danced somewhat my way to step over to them and ask boldly for a dance but indeed the tall one answered simpering that she was promised and immediately gave her hand to a great hulking farmer lout and went round the green with him and well punished she was for her waywardness for she had all her skill to save her pretty feet from his loutish stampings and very glad she was to meet the end of the dance and i knew now for certainty that it was mirdath the beautiful despite her plan of disguise and the darkness and the wench's dress and the foot gear that marred her step so great and i walked across to her and named her whispering by name and gave her plain word to be done of this unwisdom and i would take her home but she to turn from me and she stamped her foot and went again to the lout and when she had suffered another dance with him she bid him be her escort a part of the way the which he was nothing loath of and another lad that was mate to him went likewise and in a moment so soon as they were gone away from the light of the torches the rough hind lads made to set their arms about the waists of the two wenches not wetting who they had for companions and the lady mirdath was no longer able to endure and cried out in her sudden fear and disgust and struck the rough hind that embraced her so hard that he loosed her a moment swearing great oaths and directly he came back to her again and had her in a moment to kiss her and she loathing him to the very death beat him madly in the face with her hands but to no end only that i was close upon them and in that moment she screamed my name aloud and i caught the poor lout and hit him once but not to harm him overmuch yet to give him a long memory of me and afterward i threw him into the side of the road but the second hind having heard my name loosed from the tiring maid and ran for his life and indeed my strength was known all about that part and i caught mirdath the beautiful by her shoulders and shook her very soundly in my anger and afterward i sent the maid onward and she having no word from her mistress to stay went forward a little and in this fashion we came at last to the hedge gap with the lady mirdath very hushed but yet walking anigh to me as that she had some secret pleasure of my nearness and i led her through the gap and so homeward to the hall and there bid her good night at a side door that she held the key of and truly she bid me good night in an utter quiet voice and was almost as that she had no haste to be gone from me that night yet when i met her on the morrow she was full of a constant impudence to me so that having her alone to myself when the dusk was come i asked her why she would never be done of her waywardness because that i ached to have companionship of her and instead she denied my need and at that she was at once very gentle and full of a sweet and winsome understanding and surely knew that i wished to be rested for she brought out her harp and played me dear olden melodies of our childhood days all that evening and so had my love for her the more intent and glad and she saw me that night to the hedge gap having her three great boar hounds with her to company her home again but indeed i followed her afterwards very silent until i saw her safe into the hall for i would not have her alone in the night though she believed that i was then far away on the country road and as she walked with her dogs one or another would run back to me to nose against me friendly wise but i sent them off again very quiet and she had no knowledge of aught for she to go singing a love song quietly all the way home but whether she loved me i could not tell though she had a nice affection for me now on the following evening i went somewhat early to the gap and lo who should be standing in the gap talking to the lady mirdath but a very clever drest man that had a look of the court about him and he when i approached made no way for me through the gap but stood firm and eyed me very insolent so that i put out my hand and lifted him from my way and lo the lady mirdath turned a bitterness of speech upon me that gave me an utter pain and astonishment so that i was assured in a moment that she had no true love for me or she had never striven so to put me to shame before the stranger and named me uncouth and brutal to a smaller man and indeed you shall perceive how i was in my heart in that moment and i saw that there was some seeming of justice in what the lady mirdath said but yet might the man have shown a better spirit and moreover mirdath the beautiful had no true call to shame me her true friend and cousin before this stranger yet did i not stop to argue but bowed very low to the lady mirdath and afterward i bowed a little to the man and made apology for indeed he was neither great nor strong made and i had been better man to have shown courtesy to him at least in the first and so having done justice to my own respect i turned and went on and left them to their happiness now i walked then maybe twenty good miles before i came to my own home for there was no rest in me all that night or ever because that i was grown deadly in love of mirdath the beautiful and all my spirit and heart and body of me pained with the dreadful loss that i was come so sudden upon and for a great week i had my walks in another direction but in the end of that week i must take my walk along the olden way that i might chance to have but a sight of my lady and truly i had all sight that ever man did need to put him in dread pain and jealousy for truly as i came in view of the gap there was the lady mirdath walking just without the borders of the great wood and beside her there walked the clever drest man of the court and she suffered his arm around her so that i knew they were lovers for the lady mirdath had no brothers nor any youthful men kin yet when mirdath saw me upon the road she shamed in a moment to be so caught for she put her lover's arm from about her and bowed to me a little changed of colour in the face and i bowed very low being but a young man myself and so passed on with my heart very dead in me and as i went i saw that her lover came again to her and had his arm once more about her and so maybe they looked after me as i went very stiff and desperate but indeed i looked not back on them as you may think and for a great month then i went not near to the gap for my love raged in me and i was hurt in my pride and truly neither had a true justice been dealt to me by the lady mirdath yet in that month my love was a leaven in me and made slowly a sweetness and a tenderness and an understanding that were not in me before and truly love and pain do shape the character of man and in the end of that time i saw a little way into life with an understanding heart and began presently to take my walks again past the gap but truly mirdath the beautiful was never to my sight though one evening i thought she might be not a great way off for one of her great boar hounds came out of the wood and down into the road to nose against me very friendly as a dog oft doth with me yet though i waited a good time after the dog had left me i had no sight of mirdath and so passed on again with my heart heavy in me but without bitterness because of the understanding that was begun to grow in my heart now there passed two weary and lonely weeks in which i grew sick to have knowledge of the beautiful maid and truly in the end of that time i made a sudden resolving that i would go in through the gap and come to the home grounds about the hall and so maybe have some sight of her and this resolving i had one evening and i went out immediately and came to the gap and went in through the gap and so by a long walking to the gardens about the hall and truly when i was come there i saw a good light of lanthorns and torches and a great company of people dancing and all drest in quaint dress so that i knew they had a festival for some cause and there came suddenly a horrid dread into my heart that this might be the marriage dance of the lady mirdath but indeed this was foolishness for i had surely heard of the marriage if there had been any and truly in a moment i remembered that she was come one and twenty years of age on that day and to the end of her ward ship and this surely to be festival in honour of the same and a very bright and pretty matter it was to watch save that i was so heavy in the heart with loneliness and longing for the company was great and gay and the lights plentiful and set all about from the trees and in leaf made arbours about the great lawn and a great table spread with eating matters and silver and crystal and great lamps of bronze and silver went all a down one end of the lawn and the dance constant upon the other part and surely the lady mirdath to step out of the dance very lovely drest yet seeming to mine eyes a little pale in the looming of the lights and she to wander to a seat to rest and indeed in a moment there to be a dozen youths of the great families of the country side in attendance about her making talk and laughter and each eager for her favour and she very lovely in the midst of them but yet as i did think lacking of somewhat and a little pale seeming as i have told and her glance to go odd wise beyond the groupt men about her so that i understood in a moment that her lover was not there and she to be a lack in the heart for him yet why he was not there i could not suppose save that he might have been called back to the court and surely as i watched the other young men about her i burned with a fierce and miserable jealousy of them so that i could near have stept forth and plucked her out from among them and had her to walk with me in the woods as in the olden days when she also had seemed near to love but truly what use to this for it was not they who held her heart as i saw plain for i watched her with an eager and lonesome heart and knew that it was one small man of the court that was lover to her as i have told and i went away again then and came not near to the gap for three great months because that i could not bear the pain of my loss but in the end of that time my very pain to urge me to go and to be worse than the pain of not going so that i found myself one evening in the gap peering very eager and shaken across the sward that lay between the gap and the woods for this same place to be as an holy ground to me for there was it that first i saw mirdath the beautiful and surely lost my heart to her in that one night and a great time i stayed there in the gap waiting and watching hopelessly and lo sudden there came something against me touching my thigh very soft and when i looked down it was one of the boar hounds so that my heart leaped near frightened for truly my lady was come somewhere nigh as i did think and as i waited very hushed and watchful yet with an utter beating heart surely i heard a faint and low singing among the trees so utter sad and lo it was mirdath singing a broken love song and a wander there in the dark alone save for her great dogs and i harked with strange pain in me that she did be so in pain and i ached to bring her ease yet moved not but was very still there in the gap save that my being was all in turmoil and presently as i harked there came a slim white figure out from among the trees and the figure cried out something and came to a quick pause as i could see in the half dark and lo in that moment there came a sudden and unreasoned hope into me and i came up out of the gap and was come to mirdath in a moment calling very low and passionate and eager mirdath mirdath mirdath and this way i came to her and her great dog that was with me to bound beside me in thought mayhap that it was some game and when i came to the lady mirdath i held out my hands to her not knowing what i did but only the telling of my heart that needed her so utter and craved to ease her of her pain and lo she put out her arms to me and came into mine arms with a little run and there she bode weeping strangely but yet with rest upon her even as rest was come sudden and wondrous upon me and sudden she moved in mine arms and slipt her hands to me very dear and held her lips up to me like some sweet child that i kiss her but indeed she was also a true woman and in honest and dear love of me and this to be the way of our betrothal and simple and wordless it was yet sufficient only that there is no sufficiency in love now presently she loosed herself out of mine arms and we walked homeward through the woods very quiet and holding hands as children do and i then in a while to ask her about the man of the court and she laughed very sweet into the silence of the wood but gave me no answer save that i wait until we were come to the hall and when we were come there she took me into the great hall and made a very dainty and impudent bow mocking me and so made me known to another lady who sat there upon her task of embroidering which she did very demure and as that she had also a dainty mischief lurking in her and truly the lady mirdath never to be done of naughty laughter that made her dearly breathless with delight and to sway a little and set the trembling of pretty sounds in her throat and surely she must pull down two great pistols from an arm rack that i fight a duel to the death with the lady of the embroidering who held her face down over her work and shook likewise with the wickedness of her laughter that she could not hide and in the end the lady of the embroidering looked up sudden into my face and i then to see somewhat of the mischief in a moment for she had the face of the man of the court suit that had been lover to mirdath and the lady mirdath then to explain to me how that mistress alison which was her name was a dear and bosom friend and she it was that had been drest in the court suit to play a prank for a wager with a certain young man who would be lover to her an he might and i then to come along and so speedy to offence that truly i never saw her face plain because that i was so utter jealous and so the lady mirdath had been more justly in anger than i supposed because that i had put hands upon her friend as i have told and this to be all of it save that they had planned to punish me and had met every evening at the gap to play at lovers perchance i should pass so that i should have greater cause for my jealousy and truly they to have a good revenge upon me for i had suffered very great a long while because of it yet as you do mind when i came upon them the lady mirdath had a half regret that was very natural because even then she was in love of me as i of her and because of this she drew away as you shall remember being as she confessed suddenly and strangely troubled and to want me but afterwards as much set again to my punishment because that i bowed so cold and went away and indeed well i might yet truly all was safe ended now and i utter thankful and with a mad delight in the heart so that i caught up mirdath and we danced very slow and stately around the great hall the while that mistress alison whistled us a tune with her mouth which she could very clever as many another thing i wot and each day and all day after this gladness mirdath and i could never be apart but must go a wander always together here and there in an unending joy of our togetherness and in a thousand things were we at one in delight for we had both of us that nature which doth love the blue of eternity which gathers beyond the wings of the sunset and the invisible sound of the starlight falling upon the world and the quiet of grey evenings when the towers of sleep are builded unto the mystery of the dusk and the solemn green of strange pastures in the moonlight and the speech of the sycamore unto the beech and the slow way of the sea when it doth mood and the soft rustling of the night clouds and likewise had we eyes to see the dancer of the sunset casting her mighty robes so strange and ears to know that there shakes a silent thunder over the face of dawn and much else that we knew and saw and understood together in our utter joy now there happened to us about this time a certain adventure that came near to cause the death of mirdath the beautiful for one day as we wandered as ever like two children in our contentment i made remark to mirdath that there went only two of the great boar hounds with us and she then told me that the third was to the kennels being sick yet scarce had she told me so much ere she cried out something and pointed and lo i saw that the third hound came towards us at a run yet very strange seeming in his going and in a moment mirdath cried out that the hound was mad and truly i saw then that the brute slavered as he came running and in a moment he was upon us and made never a sound but leaped at me in one instant of time all before i had any thought of such intent but surely my beautiful one had a dreadful love for me for she cast herself at the dog to save me calling to the other hounds and she was bitten in a moment by the brute as she strove to hold him off from me but i to have him instant by the neck and the body and brake him so that he died at once and i cast him to the earth and gave help to mirdath that i draw the poison from the wounds and this i did so well as i might despite that she would have me stop and afterwards i took her into mine arms and ran very fierce all the long and weary way to the hall and with hot skewers i burned the wounds so that when the doctor came he to say i have saved her by my care if indeed she to be saved but truly she had saved me in any wise as you shall think so that i could never be done of honour to her and she very pale but yet to laugh at my fears and to say that she soon to have her health and the wounds healed very speedy but indeed it was a long and bitter time before they were proper healed and she so well as ever yet in time so it was and an utter weight off my heart and when mirdath was grown full strong again we set our wedding day and well do i mind how she stood there in her bridal dress on that day so slender and lovely as may love have stood in the dawn of life and the beauty of her eyes that had such sober sweetness in them despite the dear mischief of her nature and the way of her little feet and the loveliness of her hair and the dainty rogue grace of her movements and her mouth an enticement as that a child and a woman smiled out of the one face and this to be no more than but an hint of the loveliness of my beautiful one and so we were married mirdath my beautiful one lay dying and i had no power to hold death backward from such dread intent in another room i heard the little wail of the child and the wail of the child waked my wife back into this life so that her hands fluttered white and desperately needful upon the coverlid i kneeled beside my beautiful one and reached out and took her hands very gentle into mine but still they fluttered so needful and she looked at me dumbly but her eyes beseeching then i went out of the room and called gently to the nurse and the nurse brought in the child wrapped very softly in a long white robe and i saw the eyes of my beautiful one grow clearer with a strange lovely light and i beckoned to the nurse to bring the babe near my wife moved her hands very weakly upon the coverlid and i knew that she craved to touch her child and i signed to the nurse and took my child in mine arms and the nurse went out from the room and so we three were alone together then i sat very gentle upon the bed and i held the babe near to my beautiful one so that the wee cheek of the babe touched the white cheek of my dying wife but the weight of the child i kept off from her and presently i knew that mirdath my wife strove dumbly to reach for the hands of the babe and i turned the child more towards her and slipped the hands of the child into the weak hands of my beautiful one and i held the babe above my wife with an utter care so that the eyes of my dying one looked into the young eyes of the child and presently in but a few moments of time though it had been someways an eternity my beautiful one closed her eyes and lay very quiet and i took away the child to the nurse who stood beyond the door and i closed the door and came back to mine own that we have those last instants alone together and the hands of my wife lay very still and white but presently they began to move softly and weakly searching for somewhat and i put out my great hands to her and took her hands with an utter care and so a little time passed then her eyes opened quiet and grey and a little dazed seeming and she rolled her head on the pillow and saw me and the pain of forgetfulness went out of her eyes and she looked at me with a look that grew in strength unto a sweetness of tenderness and full understanding and i bent a little to her and her eyes told me to take her into mine arms for those last minutes then i went very gentle upon the bed and lifted her with an utter and tender care so that she lay suddenly strangely restful against my breast for love gave me skill to hold her and love gave my beautiful one a sweetness of ease in that little time that was left to us and so we twain were together and love seemed that it had made a truce with death in the air about us that we be undisturbed for there came a drowse of rest even upon my tense heart that had known nothing but a dreadful pain through the weary hours and i whispered my love silently to my beautiful one and her eyes answered and the strangely beautiful and terrible moments passed by into the hush of eternity and suddenly mirdath my beautiful one spoke whispering something and i stooped gently to hark and mine own spoke again and lo it was to call me by the olden love name that had been mine through all the utter lovely months of our togetherness and i began again to tell her of my love that should pass beyond death and lo in that one moment of time the light went out of her eyes and my beautiful one lay dead in mine arms my beautiful one ii the last redoubt since mirdath my beautiful one died and left me lonely in this world i have suffered an anguish and an utter and dreadful pain of longing such as truly no words shall ever tell for in truth i that had all the world through her sweet love and companionship and knew all the joy and gladness of life have known such lonesome misery as doth stun me to think upon yet am i to my pen again for of late a wondrous hope has grown in me in that i have at night in my sleep waked into the future of this world and seen strange things and utter marvels and known once more the gladness of life for i have learned the promise of the future and have visited in my dreams those places where in the womb of time she and i shall come together and part and again come together breaking asunder most drearly in pain and again reuniting after strange ages in a glad and mighty wonder and this is the utter strange story of that which i have seen and which truly i must set out if the task be not too great so that in the setting out thereof i may gain a little ease of the heart and likewise mayhap give ease of hope to some other poor human that doth suffer even as i have suffered so dreadful with longing for mine own that is dead and some shall read and say that this thing was not and some shall dispute with them but to them all i say naught save read and having read that which i set down then shall one and all have looked towards eternity with me unto its very portals and so to my telling to me in this last time of my visions of which i would tell it was not as if i dreamed but as it were that i waked there into the dark in the future of this world and the sun had died and for me thus newly waked into that future to look back upon this our present age was to look back into dreams that my soul knew to be of reality but which to those newly seeing eyes of mine appeared but as a far vision strangely hallowed with peacefulness and light always it seemed to me when i awaked into the future into the everlasting night that lapped this world that i saw near to me and girdling me all about a blurred greyness and presently this the greyness would clear and fade from about me even as a dusky cloud and i would look out upon a world of darkness lit here and there with strange sights and with my waking into that future i waked not to ignorance but to a full knowledge of those things which lit the night land even as a man wakes from sleep each morning and knows immediately he wakes the names and knowledge of the time which has bred him and in which he lives and the same while a knowledge i had as it were sub conscious of this present this early life which now i live so utterly alone in my earliest knowledge of that place i was a youth seventeen years grown and my memory tells me that when first i waked or came as it might be said to myself in that future i stood in one of the embrasures of the last redoubt that great pyramid of grey metal which held the last millions of this world from the powers of the slayers and so full am i of the knowledge of that place that scarce can i believe that none here know and because i have such difficulty it may be that i speak over familiarly of those things of which i know and heed not to explain much that it is needful that i should explain to those who must read here in this our present day for there as i stood and looked out i was less the man of years of this age than the youth of that with the natural knowledge of that life which i had gathered by living all my seventeen years of life there though until that my first vision i of this age knew not of that other and future existence yet woke to it so naturally as may a man wake here in his bed to the shining of the morning sun and know it by name and the meaning of aught else and yet as i stood there in the vast embrasure i had also a knowledge or memory of this present life of ours deep down within me but touched with a halo of dreams and yet with a conscious longing for one known even there in a half memory as mirdath as i have said in my earliest memory i mind that i stood in an embrasure high up in the side of the pyramid and looked outwards through a queer spy glass to the north west aye full of youth and with an adventurous and yet half fearful heart and in my brain was as i have told the knowledge that had come to me in all the years of my life in the redoubt and yet until that moment this man of this present time had no knowledge of that future existence and now i stood and had suddenly the knowledge of a life already spent in that strange land and deeper within me the misty knowings of this our present age and maybe also of some others to the north west i looked through the queer spy glass and saw a landscape that i had looked upon and pored upon through all the years of that life so that i knew how to name this thing and that thing and give the very distances of each and every one from the centre point of the pyramid which was that which had neither length nor breadth and was made of polished metal in the room of mathematics where i went daily to my studies to the north west i looked and in the wide field of my glass saw plain the bright glare of the fire from the red pit shine upwards against the underside of the vast chin of the north west watcher the watching thing of the north west that which hath watched from the beginning and until the opening of the gateway of eternity came into my thoughts as i looked through the glass the words of aesworpth the ancient poet though incredibly future to this our time and suddenly they seemed at fault for i looked deep down into my being and saw as dreams are seen the sunlight and splendour of this our present age and i was amazed and here i must make it clear to all that even as i waked from this age suddenly into that life so must i that youth there in the embrasure have awakened then to the knowledge of this far back life of ours seeming to him a vision of the very beginnings of eternity in the dawn of the world oh i do but dread i make it not sufficient clear that i and he were both i the same soul he of that far date seeing vaguely the life that was that i do now live in this present age and i of this time beholding the life that i yet shall live how utterly strange and yet i do not know that i speak holy truth to say that i in that future time had no knowledge of this life and age before that awakening for i woke to find that i was one who stood apart from the other youths in that i had a dim knowledge visionary as it were of the past which confounded whilst yet it angered those who were the men of learning of that age though of this matter more anon but this i do know that from that time onwards my knowledge and assuredness of the past was tenfold for this my memory of that life told me and so to further my telling yet before i pass onwards one other thing is there of which i shall speak in the moment in which i waked out of that youthfulness into the assured awaredness of this our age in that moment the hunger of this my love flew to me across the ages so that what had been but a memory dream grew to the pain of reality and i knew suddenly that i lacked and from that time onwards i went listening as even now my life is spent and so it was that i fresh born in that future time hungered strangely for my beautiful one with all the strength of that new life knowing that she had been mine and might live again even as i and so as i have said i hungered and found that i listened and now to go back from my digression it was as i have said i had amazement at perceiving in memory the unknowable sunshine and splendour of this age breaking so clear through my hitherto most vague and hazy visions so that the ignorance of aesworpth was shouted to me by the things which now i knew and from that time onward for a little space i was stunned with all that i knew and guessed and felt and all of a long while the hunger grew for that one i had lost in the early days she who had sung to me in those faery days of light that had been in verity and the especial thoughts of that age looked back with a keen regretful wonder into the gulf of forgetfulness but presently i turned from the haze and pain of my dream memories once more to the inconceivable mystery of the night land which i viewed through the great embrasure for on none did it ever come with weariness to look out upon all the hideous mysteries so that old and young watched from early years to death the black monstrosity of the night land which this our last refuge of humanity held at bay to the right of the red pit there lay a long sinuous glare which i knew as the vale of red fire and beyond that for many dreary miles the blackness of the night land across which came the coldness of the light from the plain of blue fire and then on the very borders of the unknown lands there lay a range of low volcanoes which lit up far away in the outer darkness the black hills where shone the seven lights which neither twinkled nor moved nor faltered through eternity and of which even the great spy glass could make no understanding nor had any adventurer from the pyramid ever come back to tell us aught of them and here let me say that down in the great library of the redoubt were the histories of all those with their discoveries who had ventured out into the monstrousness of the night land risking not the life only but the spirit of life and surely it is all so strange and wonderful to set out that i could almost despair with the contemplation of that which i must achieve for there is so much to tell and so few words given to man by which he may make clear that which lies beyond the sight and the present and general knowings of peoples how shall you ever know as i know in verity of the greatness and reality and terror of the thing that i would tell plain to all for we with our puny span of recorded life must have great histories to tell but the few bare details we know concerning years that are but a few thousands in all and i must set out to you in the short pages of this my life there a sufficiency of the life that had been and the life that was both within and without that mighty pyramid to make clear to those who may read the truth of that which i would tell and the histories of that great redoubt dealt not with odd thousands of years but with very millions aye away back into what they of that age conceived to be the early days of the earth when the sun maybe still gloomed dully in the night sky of the world but of all that went before nothing save as myths and matters to be taken most cautiously and believed not by men of sanity and proved wisdom and i how shall i make all this clear to you who may read the thing cannot be and yet i must tell my history for to be silent before so much wonder would be to suffer of too full a heart and i must even ease my spirit by this my struggle to tell to all how it was with me and how it will be aye even to the memories which were the possession of that far future youth who was indeed i of his childhood's days when his nurse of that age swung him and crooned impossible lullabies of this mythical sun which according to those future fairy tales had once passed across the blackness that now lay above the pyramid such is the monstrous futureness of this which i have seen through the body of that far off youth and so back to my telling to my right which was to the north there stood very far away the house of silence upon a low hill and in that house were many lights and no sound and so had it been through an uncountable eternity of years always those steady lights and no whisper of sound not even such as our distance microphones could have discovered and the danger of this house was accounted the greatest danger of all those lands and round by the house of silence wound the road where the silent ones walk and concerning this road which passed out of the unknown lands nigh by the place of the ab humans where was always the green luminous mist nothing was known save that it was held that of all the works about the mighty pyramid it was alone the one that was bred long ages past of healthy human toil and labour and on this point alone had a thousand books and more been writ and all contrary and so to no end as is ever the way in such matters and as it was with the road where the silent ones walk so it was with all those other monstrous things whole libraries had there been made upon this and upon that and many a thousand million mouldered into the forgotten dust of the earlier world i mind me now that presently i stepped upon the central travelling roadway which spanned the one thousandth plateau of the great redoubt and this lay six miles and thirty fathoms above the plain of the night land and was somewhat of a great mile or more across and so in a few minutes i was at the south eastern wall and looking out through the great embrasure towards the three silver fire holes that shone before the thing that nods away down far in the south east southward of this but nearer there rose the vast bulk of the south east watcher the watching thing of the south east and to the right and to the left of the squat monster burned the torches maybe half a mile upon each side yet sufficient light they threw to show the lumbered forward head of the never sleeping brute to the east as i stood there in the quietness of the sleeping time on the one thousandth plateau i heard a far dreadful sound down in the lightless east and presently again a strange dreadful laughter deep as a low thunder among the mountains and because this sound came odd whiles from the unknown lands beyond the valley of the hounds we had named that far and never seen place the country whence comes the great laughter and though i had heard the sound many and oft a time yet did i never hear it without a most strange thrilling of my heart and a sense of my littleness and of the utter terror which had beset the last millions of the world yet because i had heard the laughter oft i paid not over long attention to my thoughts upon it and when in a little it died away into that eastern darkness i turned my spy glass upon the giants' pit which lay to the south of the giants' kilns and these same kilns were tended by the giants and the light of the kilns was red and fitful and threw wavering shadows and lights across the mouth of the pit so that i saw giants crawling up out of the pit but not properly seen by reason of the dance of the shadows and so because ever there was so much to behold i looked away presently to that which was plainer to be examined to the back of the giants' pit was a great black headland that stood vast between the valley of the hounds where lived the monstrous night hounds and the giants and the light of the kilns struck the brow of this black headland so that constantly i saw things peer over the edge coming forward a little into the light of the kilns and drawing back swiftly into the shadows and thus it had been ever through the uncounted ages so that the headland was known as the headland from which strange things peer and thus was it marked in our maps and charts of that grim world and so i could go on ever but that i fear to weary and yet whether i do weary or not i must tell of this country that i see even now as i set my thoughts down so plainly that my memory wanders in a hushed and secret fashion along its starkness and amid its strange and dread habitants so that it is but by an effort i realise me that my body is not there in this very moment that i write and so to further tellings before me ran the road where the silent ones walk and i searched it as many a time in my earlier youth had i with the spy glass for my heart was always stirred mightily by the sight of those silent ones and presently alone in all the miles of that night grey road i saw one in the field of my glass a quiet cloaked figure moving along shrouded and looking neither to right nor left and thus was it with these beings ever it was told about in the redoubt that they would harm no human if but the human did keep a fair distance from them but that it were wise never to come close upon one and this i can well believe and so searching the road with my gaze i passed beyond this silent one and past the place where the road sweeping vastly to the south east was lit a space strangely by the light from the silver fire holes and thus at last to where it swayed to the south of the dark palace and thence southward still until it passed round to the westward beyond the mountain bulk of the watching thing in the south the hugest monster in all the visible night lands my spy glass showed it to me with clearness a living hill of watchfulness known to us as the watcher of the south it brooded there squat and tremendous hunched over the pale radiance of the glowing dome much i know had been writ concerning this odd vast watcher for it had grown out of the blackness of the south unknown lands a million years gone and the steady growing nearness of it had been noted and set out at length by the men they called monstruwacans so that it was possible to search in our libraries and learn of the very coming of this beast in the olden time and while i mind me there were even then and always men named monstruwacans whose duty it was to take heed of the great forces and to watch the monsters and the beasts that beset the great pyramid and measure and record and have so full a knowledge of these same that did one but sway an head in the darkness the same matter was set down with particularness in the records and so to tell more about the south watcher a million years gone as i have told came it out from the blackness of the south and grew steadily nearer through twenty thousand years but so slow that in no one year could a man perceive that it had moved yet it had movement and had come thus far upon its road to the redoubt when the glowing dome rose out of the ground before it growing slowly and this had stayed the way of the monster so that through an eternity it had looked towards the pyramid across the pale glare of the dome and seeming to have no power to advance nearer and because of this much had been writ to prove that there were other forces than evil at work in the night lands about the last redoubt and this i have always thought to be wisely said and indeed there to be no doubt to the matter for there were many things in the time of which i have knowledge which seemed to make clear that even as the forces of darkness were loose upon the end of man so were there other forces out to do battle with the terror though in ways most strange and unthought of by the human mind and of this i shall have more to tell anon and here before i go further with my telling let me set out some of that knowledge which yet remains so clear within my mind and heart of the coming of these monstrosities and evil forces no man could say much with verity for the evil of it began before the histories of the great redoubt were shaped aye even before the sun had lost all power to light though it must not be a thing of certainty that even at this far time the invisible black heavens held no warmth for this world but of this i have no room to tell and must pass on to that of which i have a more certain knowledge the evil must surely have begun in the days of the darkening which i might liken to a story which was believed doubtfully much as we of this day believe the story of the creation a dim record there was of olden sciences that are yet far off in our future which disturbing the unmeasurable outward powers had allowed to pass the barrier of life some of those monsters and ab human creatures which are so wondrously cushioned from us at this normal present and thus there had materialized and in other cases developed grotesque and horrible creatures which now beset the humans of this world and where there was no power to take on material form there had been allowed to certain dreadful forces to have power to affect the life of the human spirit and this growing very dreadful and the world full of lawlessness and degeneracy there had banded together the sound millions and built the last redoubt there in the twilight of the world so it seems to us and yet to them bred at last to the peace of usage as it were the beginning and this i can make no clearer and none hath right to expect it for my task is very great and beyond the power of human skill and when the humans had built the great pyramid it had one thousand three hundred and twenty floors and the thickness of each floor was according to the strength of its need and the whole height of this pyramid exceeded seven miles by near a mile and above it was a tower from which the watchmen looked these being called the monstruwacans but where the redoubt was built i know not save that i believe in a mighty valley of which i may tell more in due time and when the pyramid was built the last millions who were the builders thereof went within and made themselves a great house and city of this last redoubt and thus began the second history of this world and how shall i set it all down in these little pages for my task even as i see it is too great for the power of a single life and a single pen yet to it and later through hundreds and thousands of years there grew up in the outer lands beyond those which lay under the guard of the redoubt mighty and lost races of terrible creatures half men and half beast and evil and dreadful and these made war upon the redoubt but were beaten off from that grim metal mountain with a vast slaughter yet must there have been many such attacks until the electric circle was put about the pyramid and lit from the earth current and the lowest half mile of the pyramid was sealed and so at last there was a peace and the beginnings of that eternity of quiet watching for the day when the earth current shall become exhausted and at whiles through the forgotten centuries had the creatures been glutted time and again upon such odd bands of daring ones as had adventured forth to explore through the mystery of the night lands for of those who went scarce any did ever return for there were eyes in all that dark and powers and forces abroad which had all knowledge or so we must fain believe and then so it would seem as that eternal night lengthened itself upon the world the power of terror grew and strengthened and fresh and greater monsters developed and bred out of all space and outward dimensions attracted even as it might be infernal sharks by that lonely and mighty hill of humanity facing its end so near to the eternal and yet so far deferred in the minds and to the senses of those humans and thus hath it been ever and all this but by the way and vague and ill told and set out in despair to make a little clear the beginnings of that state which is so strange to our conceptions and yet which had become a condition of naturalness to humanity in that stupendous future thus had the giants come fathered of bestial humans and mothered of monsters and many and diverse were the creatures which had some human semblance and intelligence mechanical and cunning so that certain of these lesser brutes had machinery and underground ways having need to secure to themselves warmth and air even as healthy humans only that they were incredibly inured to hardship as they might be wolves set in comparison with tender children and surely do i make this thing clear and now to continue my telling concerning the night land the watcher of the south was as i have set to make known a monster differing from those other watching things of which i have spoken and of which there were in all four one to the north west and one to the south east and of these i have told and the other twain lay brooding one to the south west and the other to the north east and thus the four watchers kept ward through the darkness upon the pyramid and moved not neither gave they out any sound yet did we know them to be mountains of living watchfulness and hideous and steadfast intelligence and so in a while having listened to the sorrowful sound which came ever to us over the grey dunes from the country of wailing which lay to the south midway between the redoubt and the watcher of the south i passed upon one of the moving roadways over to the south western side of the pyramid and looked from a narrow embrasure thence far down into the deep valley which was four miles deep and in which was the pit of the red smoke and the mouth of this pit was one full mile across and the smoke of the pit filled the valley at times so that it seemed but as a glowing red circle amid dull thunderous clouds of redness yet the red smoke rose never much above the valley so that there was clear sight across to the country beyond and there along the further edge of that great depth were the towers each maybe a mile high grey and quiet but with a shimmer upon them beyond these south and west of them was the enormous bulk of the south west watcher and from the ground rose what we named the eye beam a single ray of grey light which came up out of the ground and lit the right eye of the monster and because of this light that eye had been mightily examined through unknown thousands of years and some held that the eye looked through the light steadfastly at the pyramid but others set out that the light blinded it and was the work of those other powers which were abroad to do combat with the evil forces but however this may be as i stood there in the embrasure and looked at the thing through the spy glass it seemed to my soul that the brute looked straightly at me unwinking and steadfast and fully of a knowledge that i spied upon it and this is how i felt to the north of this in the direction of the west i saw the place where the silent ones kill and this was so named because there maybe ten thousand years gone certain humans adventuring from the pyramid came off the road where the silent ones walk and into that place and were immediately destroyed and this was told by one who escaped though he died also very quickly for his heart was frozen and this i cannot explain but so it was set out in the records far away beyond the place where the silent ones kill in the very mouth of the western night was the place of the ab humans where was lost the road where the silent ones walk in a dull green luminous mist and of this place nothing was known though much it held the thoughts and attentions of our thinkers and imaginers for some said that there was a place of safety differing from the redoubt as we of this day suppose heaven to differ from the earth and that the road led thence but was barred by the ab humans and this i can only set down here but with no thought to justify or uphold it later i travelled over to the north eastern wall of the redoubt and looked thence with my spy glass at the watcher of the north east the crowned watcher it was called in that within the air above its vast head there hung always a blue luminous ring which shed a strange light downwards over the monster showing a vast wrinkled brow upon which an whole library had been writ but putting to the shadow all the lower face all save the ear which came out from the back of the head and belled towards the redoubt and had been said by some observers in the past to have been seen to quiver but how that might be i knew not for no man of our days had seen such a thing and beyond the watching thing was the place where the silent ones are never close by the great road which was bounded upon the far side by the giant's sea and upon the far side of that was a road which was always named the road by the quiet city for it passed along that place where burned forever the constant and never moving lights of a strange city but no glass had ever shown life there neither had any light ever ceased to burn and beyond that again was the black mist and here let me say that the valley of the hounds ended towards the lights of the quiet city and so have i set out something of that land and of those creatures and circumstances which beset us about waiting until the day of doom when our earth current should cease and leave us helpless to the watchers and the abundant terror and there i stood and looked forth composedly as may one who has been born to know of such matters and reared in the knowledge of them and anon i would look upward and see the grey metalled mountain going up measureless into the gloom of the everlasting night and from my feet the sheer downward sweep of the grim metal walls six full miles and more to the plain below and one thing aye and i fear me many have i missed to set out with particularness there was as you do know all around the base of the pyramid which was five and one quarter miles every way a great circle of light which was set up by the earth current and burned within a transparent tube or had that appearance and it bounded the pyramid for a clear mile upon every side and burned for ever and none of the monsters had power ever to pass across because of what we did call the air clog that it did make as an invisible wall of safety and it did give out also a more subtile vibration that did affect the weak brain elements of the monsters and the lower men brutes and some did hold that there went from it a further vibration of a greater subtileness that gave a protecting against the evil forces and some quality it had truly thiswise for the evil powers had no ability to cause harm to any within yet were there some dangers against which it might not avail but these had no cunning to bring harm to any within the great redoubt who had wisdom to meddle with no dreadfulness and so were those last millions guarded until the earth current should be used to its end and this circle is that which i have called the electric circle though with failure to explain but there it was called only the circle and thus have i with great effort made a little clear that grim land of night where presently my listening heard one calling across the dark and how that this grew upon me i will set out forthwith iii the quiet calling now oft had i heard tell not only in that great city which occupied the thousandth floor but in others of the one thousand three hundred and twenty cities of the pyramid that there was somewhere out in the desolation of the night lands a second place of refuge where had gathered in another part of this dead world some last millions of the human race to fight unto the end and this story i heard everywhere in my travels through the cities of the great redoubt which travels began when i came upon my seventeenth year and continued for three years and two hundred and twenty five days being even then but one day in each city as was the custom in the training of every child and truly it was a great journey and in it i met with many whom to know was to love but whom never could i see again for life has not space enough and each must to his duty to the security and well being of the redoubt yet for all that i have set down we travelled much always but there were so many millions and so few years and as i have said everywhere i went there was the same story of this other place of refuge and in such of the libraries of those cities as i had time to search there were great numbers of works upon the existence of this other refuge and some far back in the years made assertion with confidence that such a place was in verity and indeed no doubt did there seem in those by gone ages but now these very records were read only by scholars who doubted even whilst they read and so is it ever but of the reality of this refuge i had never a sound doubt from the day of my hearing concerning it from our master monstruwacan who with all his assistants occupied the tower of observation in the apex of the pyramid and here let me tell that he and i had always an affinity and close friendship one for the other though he was full grown and i but a youth yet so it was and thus when i had come to an age of twenty one years of life he opened to me a post within the tower of observation and this was a most wondrous good fortune to me for in all the vast redoubt to be appointed to the tower of observation was the most desired for thereby even as in these days doth astronomy was the natural curiosity of man eased somewhat even while thwarted now let me tell here also lest it be thought that i was unduly favoured because of my friendship with the master monstruwacan that there was a sound justification for his choice in that to me had been given that strange gift of hearing which we called night hearing though this was but a fanciful name and meant little yet the peculiar gift was rare and in all the millions of the pyramid there was none with the gift to a great degree saving only myself and i because of this gift could hear the invisible vibrations of the aether so that without harking to the calling of our recording instruments i could take the messages which came continually through the eternal darkness aye even better than they and now it may be the better understood how much was to be counted that i had grown to listen for a voice that had not rung in mine ears for an eternity and yet which sang sweet and clear in my memory dreams so that it seemed to me that mirdath the beautiful slept within my soul and whispered to me out of all the ages and then one day at the fifteenth hour when began the sleep time i had been pondering this love of mine that lived with me still and marvelling that my memory dreams held the voice of a love that had been in so remote an age and pondering and dreaming thus as a young man may i could fancy this aeon lost one were whispering beauty into my ears in verity so clear had my memory grown and so much had i pondered and lo as i stood there harking and communing with my thoughts i thrilled suddenly as if i had been smitten for out of all the everlasting night a whisper was thrilling and thrilling upon my more subtile hearing through four long years had i listened since that awakening in the embrasure when but a youth of seventeen and now out of the world darkness and all the eternal years of that lost life which now i live in this present age of ours was the whisper come for i knew it upon that instant and yet because i was so taught to wisdom i answered by no name but sent the master word through the night sending it with my brain elements as i could and as all may much or little as may be if they be not clods and moreover i knew that she who called quietly would have the power to hear without instruments if indeed it were she and if it were but one of the false callings of the evil forces or more cunning monsters or as was sometimes thought concerning these callings the house of silence meddling with our souls then would they have no power to say the master word for this had been proven through all the everlasting and lo as i stood trembling and striving not to be tense which destroys the receptivity there came thrilling round and round my spiritual essence the throb of the master word beating steadily in the night as doth that marvellous sound and then with all that was sweet in my spirit i called with my brain elements mirdath mirdath mirdath and at that instant the master monstruwacan entered that part of the tower of observation where i stood and seeing my face stood very quiet for though he had not the power of night hearing he was wise and thoughtful and took much account of my gift more over he had but come from the receiving instrument and thought vaguely to have caught the throb of the master word though too faint to come proper through the instrument so that he searched for me in that i who had the hearing might listen for it i being as i have said gifted in that wise and to him i told something of my story and my thoughts and my memories and of that awakening and thus up to this present happening and he hearkened with sympathy and a troubled and wondering heart for in that age a man might talk sanely upon that which in this age of ours would be accounted foolishness and maybe the breathings of insanity for there by the refinement of arts of mentality and the results of strange experiments and the accomplishment of learning men were abled to conceive of matters now closed to our conceptions even as we of this day may haply give a calm ear to talk that in the days of our fathers would have been surely set to the count of lunacy and this is very clear and all the while that i told my story i listened with my spirit but save for a sense of faint happy laughter that wrapped about me i heard naught and nothing more all that day here let me put down that because of my memories and half memories i would time and again dispute with our learned men they being in doubt as to the verity of that olden story of the days of light and the existence of the sun though something of all this was set out as of truth in our oldest records but i remembering told them many tales that seemed fairy like to them and entranced their hearts even whilst i angered their brains which refused to take seriously and as verity that which their hearts accepted gladly even as we receive the wonder of poetry into our souls but the master monstruwacan would listen to aught i had to tell aye though i spoke through hours and so it would be odd times that having talked long drawing my stories from my memory dreams i would come back again into the present of that future and lo all the monstruwacans would have left their instruments and observations and recording and be gathered about me and the master so sunken in interest that he not to have discovered them neither had i noticed being so full of the things which had been but when the master came back to knowledge of that present he would rouse and chide and they all those lesser ones would fly swiftly and guiltily to their various works and yet so i have thought since each with a muddled and bewildered and thoughtful air upon him and hungry they were for more and ever wondering and setting questions about and so it was also with those others those learned ones who were not of the tower of observation and who disbelieved even whilst they hungered listen would they though i talked from the first hour which was the dawn to the fifteenth hour which was the beginning of the night for the sleep time was set thus after other usage and experiment and odd whiles i found that there were among them men of extraordinary learning who upheld my tellings as tales of verity and so there was a faction but later there grew more to believe and whether they believed or not all were ready to listen so that i might have spended my days in talk only that i had my work to do but the master monstruwacan believed from the beginning and was wise always to understand so that i loved him for this as for many another dear quality and so as may be conceived among all those millions i was singled out to be known for the stories that i told went downward through a thousand cities and presently in the lowest tier of the underground fields an hundred miles deep in the earth below the redoubt i found that the very ploughboys knew something concerning my tellings and gathered about me one time and another when the master monstruwacan and i had gone down regarding some matter that dealt with the earth current and our instruments and of the underground fields though in that age we called them no more than the fields i should set down a little for they were the mightiest work of this world so that even the last redoubt was but a small thing beside them an hundred miles deep lay the lowest of the underground fields and was an hundred miles from side to side every way and above it there were three hundred and six fields each one less in area than that beneath and in this wise they tapered until the topmost field which lay direct beneath the lowermost floor of the great redoubt was but four miles every way and thus it will be seen that these fields lying one beneath the other formed a mighty and incredible pyramid of country lands in the deep earth an hundred miles from the base unto the topmost field and the whole was sheathed in at the sides with the grey metal of which the redoubt was builded and each field was pillared and floored beneath the soil with this same compound of wonder and so was it secure and the monsters could not dig into that mighty garden from without and all of that underground land was lit where needed by the earth current and that same life stream fructified the soil and gave life and blood to the plants and to the trees and to every bush and natural thing and the making of those fields had taken maybe a million years and the dump thereof had been cast into the crack whence came the earth current and which had bottom beyond all soundings and this underground country had its own winds and air currents so that to my memory it was in no ways connected to the monstrous air shafts of the pyramid but in this i may be mistaken for it has not been given to me to know all that is to be known concerning that vast redoubt nor by any one man could so much knowledge be achieved yet that there were wise and justly promoted winds in that underground country i do know for healthful and sweet they were and in the corn fields there was the sweet rustle of grain and the glad silken laughter of poppies all beneath a warm and happy light and here did the millions walk and take excursion and go orderly or not even as in these days and all this have i seen and the talk of a thousand lovers in the gardens of that place comes back to me and with it all the memory of my dear one and of a faint calling that would seem to whisper about me at times but so faint and attenuated that even i who had the night hearing could not catch its import and so went listening ever the more intently and oft times calling now there was a law in the pyramid tried and healthful which held that no male should have freedom to adventure into the night land before the age of twenty two and no female ever yet that after such age if a youth desired greatly to make the adventure he should receive three lectures upon the dangers of which we had knowledge and a strict account of the mutilatings and horrid deeds done to those who had so adventured and if after this had passed over him he still desired and if he were accounted healthful and sane then should he be allowed to make the adventure and it was accounted honour to the youth who should add to the knowledge of the pyramid but to all such as went forth into the danger of the night land there was set beneath the skin of the inner side of the left forearm a small capsule and when the wound had healed then might the youth make the adventure and the wherefore of this was that the spirit of the youth might be saved if he were entrapped for then upon the honour of his soul must he bite forth the capsule and immediately his spirit would have safety in death and by this shall you know somewhat the grim and horrid danger of the dark land and this i have set down because later i was to make huge adventure into those lands and even at this time some thought of the same had come to me for always i went listening for that quiet calling and twice i sent the master word throbbing solemnly through the everlasting night yet this i did no more without certainty for the word must not be used lightly but often would i say with my brain elements mirdath mirdath sending the name out into the darkness and sometimes would i seem to hear the faint thrilling of the aether around me as though one answered but weakly as it were with a weakened spirit or by instrument that lacked of its earth force and thus for a great while there was no certainty but only a strange anxiousness and no clear answer then one day as i stood by the instruments in the tower of observation at the thirteenth hour there came the thrilling of beaten aether all about me as it were that all the void was disturbed and i made the sign for silence so that the men moved not in all the tower but bowed over their breathing bells that all disturbance might cease and again came the gentle thrilling and broke out into a clear low calling in my brain and the calling was my name the old earth name of this day and not the name of that age and the name smote me with a frightenedness of fresh awakening memories and immediately i sent the master word into the night and all the aether was full of movement and a silence came and later a beat afar off in the void of night which only i in all that great redoubt could hear until the heavier vibrations were come and in a moment there was all about me the throbbing of the master word beating in the night a sure answer yet before this i knew that mirdath had called but now had surety and immediately i said mirdath making use of the instruments and there came a swift and beautiful answer for out of the dark there stole an old love name that she only had ever used to me and presently i minded me of the men and signed to them that they should continue for the records must not be broken and now i had the communication full established and by me stood the master monstruwacan quietly as any young monstruwacan waiting with slips to make any notes that were needful and keeping a strict eye upon those others but not unkindly and so for a space of wonder i had speech with that girl out in the darkness of the world who had knowledge of my name and of the old earth love name and named herself mirdath and much i questioned her and presently to my sorrow for it seemed that her name was not truly mirdath but naani neither had she known my name but that in the library of that place where she abode there had been a story of one named by my name and called by that sweet love name which she had sent out somewhat ruthless into the night and the girl's name had been mirdath and when first she naani had called there had come back to her a cry of mirdath mirdath and this had minded her so strangely of that olden story which had stayed in her memory that she had answered as the maid in that book might have answered and thus did it seem that the utter romance of my memory love had vanished and i stood strangely troubled for sorrow of a love of olden times yet even then i marvelled that any book should have story so much like to mine not heeding that the history of all love is writ with one pen yet even then in that hour of my strange and quaintly foolish pain there came a thing that set me thrilling though more afterwards when i came to think afresh upon it for the girl who spoke to me through the night made some wonder that my voice were not deeper yet in quiet fashion and as one who says a thing scarce wotting what they say but even to me then there came a sudden hope for in the olden days of this present age my voice had been very deep and i said to her that maybe the man in the book was said to have had a deep tone of speech but she seeming puzzled said nay and at that i questioned her the more but only to the trouble of her memory and understanding and strange must it seem that we two should talk on so trivial a matter when there was so much else that we had need to exchange thought upon for were a man in this present day to have speech with those who may live within that red planet of mars within the sky scarce could the wonder of it exceed the wonder of a human voice coming through that night unto the great redoubt out of all that lost darkness for indeed this must have been the breaking of maybe a million years of silence and already as i came to know later was the news passing downward from city to city through all the vast pyramid so that the hour slips were full of the news and every city eager and excited and waiting and i better known in that one moment than in all my life before for that previous calling had been but vaguely put about and then set to the count of a nature blown upon over easily by spirit winds of the half memory of dreams though it is indeed true as i have set down before this that my tales concerning the early days of the world when the sun was visible and full of light had gone down through all the cities and had much comment and setting forth in the hour slips and were a cause for speech and argument now concerning the voice of this girl coming to us through the darkness of the world i will set out that which she had to tell and this indeed but verified the tellings of our most ancient records which had so long been treated over lightly there was it would seem somewhere out in the lonesome dark of the outer lands but at what distance none could ever discover a second redoubt that was a three sided pyramid and moderate small being no more than a mile in height and scarce three quarters of a mile along the bases when this redoubt was first builded it had been upon the far shore of a sea where now was no sea and it had been raised by those wandering humans who had grown weary of wandering and weary of the danger of night attacks by the tribes of half human monsters which began to inhabit the earth even so early as the days when the half gloom was upon the world and he that had made the plan upon which it was builded was one who had seen the great redoubt having lived there in the beginning but escaped because of a correction set upon him for his spirit of irresponsibility which had made him to cause disturbance among the orderly ones in the lowest city of the great redoubt yet in time he too had come to be tamed by the weight of fear of the ever growing hordes of monsters and the forces that were abroad and so he being a master spirit planned and builded the smaller redoubt being aided thereto by four millions who also were weary of the harass of the monsters but until then had been wanderers because of the restlessness of their blood and they had chosen that place because there they had discovered a sign of the earth current in a great valley which led to the shore for without the earth current no refuge could have existence and whilst many builded and guarded and cared for the great camp in which all lived others worked within a great shaft and in ten years had made this to a distance of many miles and therewith they tapt the earth current but not a great stream yet a sufficiency as was believed and presently after many years they had builded the pyramid and taken up their refuge there and made them instruments and ordained monstruwacans so that they had speech daily with the great pyramid and thus for many long ages and the earth current then to begin to fail and though they laboured through many thousands of years they came to no better resource and so it was they ceased to have communication with the great redoubt for the current had a lack of power to work the instruments and the recording instruments ceased to be sensible of our messages and thereafter came a million years maybe of silence with ever the birthing and marrying and dying of those lonesome humans and they grew less and some put this to the lack of the earth current which dwindled slowly through the centuries of that eternity and once in a thousand years maybe one among them would be sensitive and abled to hear beyond ordinary and to these at times there would seem to come the thrilling of the aether so that such an one would go listening and sometimes seem to catch half messages and so awaken a great interest in all the pyramid and there would be turning up of old records and many words and writings and attempts to send the master word through the night in which doubtless sometimes they succeeded for there was set down in the records of the great redoubt certain occasions on which there had come the call of the master word which had been arranged and made holy between the two redoubts in the early days of that second life of this world yet now for an hundred thousand years there had been none sensitive and in that time the people of the pyramid had become no more than ten thousand and the earth current was weak and powerless to put the joy of life into them so that they went listlessly but deemed it not strange because of so many aeons of usage and then to the wonder of all the earth current had put forth a new power so that young people ceased to be old over soon and there was happiness and a certain joy in the living and a strange birthing of children such as had not been through half a million years and then came a new thing naani the daughter of the master monstruwacan of that redoubt had shown to all that she was sensitive for she had perceived odd vibrations afloat in the night and concerning these she told her father and presently because their blood moved afresh in their bodies they had heart to discover the plans of the ancient instruments for the instruments had long rusted and been forgotten and so they builded them a new instrument to send forth a message for they had no memory at that time that the brain elements had power to do thus though mayhap their brain elements were weakened through so many ages of starvation of the earth current and could not have obeyed even had their masters known all that we of the great redoubt knew and when the instrument was finished to naani was given the right to call first across the dark to discover whether indeed after that million years of silence they were yet companied upon this earth or whether they were in truth lonely the last poor thousands of the humans and a great and painful excitement came upon the people of the lesser pyramid for the loneliness of the world pressed upon them and it was to them as though we in this age called to a star across the abyss of space and because of the excitement and pain of the moment naani called only vaguely with the instrument into the dark and lo in a moment as it seemed there came all about her in the night the solemn throb of the master word beating in the night and naani cried out that she was answered and as may be thought many of the people wept and some prayed and some were silent but others beseeched her that she call again and quickly to have further speech with those of their kind and naani spoke the master word into the night and directly there came a calling all about her mirdath mirdath and the strange wonder of it made her silent a moment but when she would have made reply the instrument had ceased to work and she could have no further speech at that time this as may be thought occasioned much distress and constant work they had between the instrument and the earth current to discover the reason for this failing but could not for a great while and in that time oft did naani hear the call of mirdath thrilling about her and twice there came the solemn beat of the master word in the night yet never had she the power to answer and all that while as i learned in time was she stirred with a quaint ache at heart by the voice that called mirdath as it might be the spirit of love searching for its mate for this is how she put it and thus it chanced that the constant thrilling of this name about her woke her to memory of a book she had read in early years and but half understood for it was ancient and writ in an olden fashion and it set out the love of a man and a maid and the maid's name was mirdath and so because she was full of this great awakening of those ages of silence and the calling of that name she found the book again and read it many times and grew to a sound love of the beauty of that tale and presently when the instrument was made right she called into the night the name of that man within the book and so it came about that i had hoped too much yet even now was i strangely unsure whether to cease from hoping and one other thing there is which i would make clear many and oft a time had i heard a thrilling of sweet faint laughter about me and the stirring of the aether by words too gentle to come clearly and these i make no doubt came from naani using her brain elements unwittingly and in ignorance but very eager to answer my callings and having no knowledge that far off across the blackness of the world they thrilled about me constantly and after naani had made clear all that i have set out concerning the lesser refuge she told further how that food was not plentiful with them though until the reawakening of the earth current they had gone unknowing of this being of small appetite and caring little for aught but now wakened and newly hungry they savoured a lack of taste in all that they ate and this we could well conceive from our reasonings and theory but happily not from our knowledge and we said unto them that the soil had lost its life and the crops therefrom were not vital and a great while it would take for the earth within their pyramid to receive back the life elements and we told them certain ways by which they might bring a more speedy life to the soil and this they were eager to do being freshly alive after so long a time of half life and now you must know that in all the great redoubt the story went downwards swiftly and was published in all the hour sheets with many comments and the libraries were full of those who would look up the olden records which for so long had been forgotten or taken as we of this day would say with a pinch of salt and all the time i was pestered with questions so that had i not been determined i should scarce have been allowed to sleep moreover so much was writ about me and my power to hear and divers stories concerning tales of love that i had been like to have grown mazed to take note of it all yet some note i did take and much i found pleasant but some displeasing and for the rest i was not spoiled as the saying goes for i had my work to do moreover i was always busied listening and having speech through the darkness though if any saw me so they would question and because of this i kept much to the tower of observation where was the master monstruwacan and a greater discipline and then began a fresh matter though but an old enough trick for i speak now of the days that followed that re opening of the talk between the pyramids oft would speech come to us out of the night and there would be tales of the sore need of the lesser redoubt and callings for help yet when i sent the master word abroad there would be no answering and so i feared that the monsters and forces of evil knew yet at times the master word would answer to us beating steadily in the night and when we questioned afresh we knew that they in the lesser redoubt had caught the beat of the master word and so made reply though it had not been they who had made the previous talk which we had sought to test by the word and then they would make contradiction of all that had been spoken so cunningly so that we knew the monsters and forces had sought to tempt some from the safety of the redoubt yet was this no new thing as i have made to hint saving that it grew now to a greater persistence and there was a loathsome cunning in the using of this new knowledge to the making of wicked and false messages by those evil things of the night land and it told to us as i have made remark how that those monsters and forces had a full awaredness of the speech between the pyramids yet could they have no power to say the master word so had we some test left and a way to sure knowledge of what made talk in the night and all that i have told should bring to those of this age something of the yet unbegotten terror of that and a quiet and sound thankfulness to god that we suffer not as humanity shall yet suffer but for all this let it not be thought that they of that age accounted it as suffering but as no more than the usual of human existence and by this may we know that we can meet all circumstances and use ourselves to them and live through them wisely if we be but prudent and consider means of invention and through all the night land there was an extraordinary awakening among the monsters and forces so that the instruments made constant note of greater powers at work out there in the darkness and the monstruwacans were busied recording and keeping a very strict watch and so was there at all that time a sense of difference and awakening and of wonders about and to come and from the country whence comes the great laughter the laughter sounded constant as it were an uncomfortable and heart shaking voice thunder rolling thence over the lands out from the unknown east and the pit of the red smoke filled all the deep valley with redness so that the smoke rose above the edge and hid the bases of the towers upon the far side and the giants could be seen plentiful around the kilns to the east and from the kilns great belches of fire though the meaning of it as of all else we could not say but only the cause and from the mountain of the voice which rose to the south east of the south east watcher and of which i have made no telling hitherto in this faulty setting out i heard for the first time in that life the calling of the voice and though the records made mention of it yet not often was it heard and the calling was shrill and very peculiar and distressful and horrible as though a giant woman hungering strangely shouted unknown words across the night and this was how it seemed to me and many thought this to describe the sound and by all this may you perceive how that land was awakened and other tricks there were to entice us into the night land and once a call came thrilling in the aether and told to us that certain humans had escaped from the lesser redoubt and drew nigh to us but were faint for food and craved succour yet when we sent the master word into the night the creatures without could make no reply which was a very happy thing for our souls for we had been all mightily exercised in our hearts by this one message and now had proof that it was but a trap and constantly and at all hours i would have speech with naani of the lesser redoubt for i had taught her how she might send her thoughts through the night with her brain elements but not to over use this power for it exhausts the body and the powers of the mind if it be abused by exceeding usage yet despite that i had taught her the use of her brain elements she sent her message always without strength save when she had use of the instrument and this i set to the cause that she had not the health force needful but apart from this she had the night hearing very keen though less than mine and so with many times of speech and constant tellings of our doings and thoughts we drew near in the spirit to one another and had always a feeling in our hearts that we had been given previous acquaintance and this as may be thought thrilled my heart very strangely iv the hushing of the voice dearest thine own feet tread the world at night treading as moon flakes step across a dark kissing the very dew to holier light thy voice a song past mountains which to hark frightens my soul with an utter lost delight now one night towards the end of the sixteenth hour as i made ready to sleep there came all about me the thrilling of the aether as happened oft in those days but the thrilling had a strange power in it and in my soul the voice of naani sounded plain all within and about me yet though i knew it to be the voice of naani i answered not immediately save to send the sure question of the master word into the night and directly i heard the answer the master word beating steadily in the night and i questioned naani why she had speech with me by the instrument at that time when all were sleeping and the watch set among the monstruwacans for they in the little pyramid had their sleep time to commence at the eleventh hour so that by this it was five hours advanced towards the time of waking and naani should have slept nor have been abroad to the tower of observation apart from her father for i supposed that she spoke by the instrument her voice sounding very clear in my brain yet to this question she made no answer in kind but gave a certain thing into my spirit which set me trembling for she said certain words that began dearest thine own feet tread the world at night and it well may be that she set me to tremble for as the words grew about me there wakened a memory dream how that i had made these same words to mirdath the beautiful in the long gone eternity of this our age when she had died and left me alone in all the world and i was weak a little with the tumult and force of my emotion but in a moment i called eagerly with my brain elements to naani to give some explaining of this thing that she had spoken to the utter troubling of my heart yet once more she made no direct answer but spoke the words again to me across all the dark of the world and it came to me suddenly that it was not naani that spoke but mirdath the beautiful from out of all the everlasting night and i called mirdath mirdath with my brain elements into the night and lo the far faint voice spoke again to my spirit through all the darkness of eternity saying again those words yet though the voice was the voice of mirdath the beautiful it was also the voice of naani and i knew in all my heart that this thing was in verity and that it had been given to me to be birthed once more into this world in the living time of that only one with whom my spirit and essence hath mated in all ages through the everlasting and i called with my brain elements and all my strength to naani but there came no answer neither sign of hearing though through hours i called and thus at last i came to an utter exhaustion but neither could be quiet nor sleep yet presently i slept and when i waked my first memory was of the wondrous thing which had befallen in the sleep time for none in all this world could have known those words save it had been the spirit of mirdath my beautiful one looking from above my shoulder in that utter lost time as i made those words to her out of an aching and a broken heart and the voice had been the voice of mirdath and the voice of mirdath had been the voice of naani and what shall any say to this save that which i had in my heart and immediately i called to naani once and again twice and in a little moment there came all about me the throbbing of the master word beating solemnly in the night and i sent the master word to give assurance and immediately the voice of naani a little weak as was it always when she had not the instrument but sent the message with her brain elements and i answered her and questioned her eagerly concerning her sayings of the past time of sleep but she disclaimed and made clear to me that she had no knowledge of having spoken but had slept through all that time of which i made to tell and indeed had dreamed a very strange dream and for a little while i was confused and meditated not knowing what to think but came suddenly again to a knowledge that naani's far voice was thrilling the aether all about and that she would tell to me her dream which had set strong upon her mind and she told the dream to me and in the dream she had seen a tall dark man built very big and dressed in unfamiliar clothing and the man had been in a little room and very sorrowful and lonesome and in her dream she had gone nigh to him and presently the man made to write that he might ease him by giving expression to his sorrow and naani had been able to read the words that he wrote though to her waking spirit the language in which they were writ was strange and unknown yet she could not remember what he had writ save but one short line and this she had mind of in that he had writ the word mirdath above and she spoke of the strangeness of this thing that she should dream of this name but supposed that i had fixed it upon her by my first callings and then did i with something of a tremble in my spirit ask naani to tell me what she remembered of the writing of that big sorrowful stranger and in a little moment her far voice said these words all about me dearest thine own feet tread the world at night but no more had she memory of yet it was a sufficiency and i maybe with a mad strange triumph in my soul said unto her with my brain elements that which remained of those words and my spirit felt them strike upon the spirit of naani and awake her memory as with the violence of a blow and for a little while she stumbled dumb before so much newness and certainly and her spirit then to waken and she near wept with the fright and the sudden new wonder of this thing and immediately all about me there came her voice thrilling and the voice was the voice of mirdath and the voice of naani and i heard the tears of her spirit make pure and wonderful the bewildered and growing gladness of her far voice and she asked me as one who had suddenly opened the gates of memory whether she might be truly mirdath and i utter weak and shaken strangely because of this splendour of fulfilment could make no instant answer and she asked again but using mine old love name and with a sureness in her far voice and still i was so strangely dumb and the blood to thud peculiar in mine ears and this to pass and speech to come swift and this way to be that meeting of our spirits across all the everlasting night and you shall have for a memory picture how that naani stood there in the world in that far eternity and with her spirit having speech with mine looked back through the part opened gates of her memory into the past of this our life and age yet more than this she saw and more than was given to me in that age for she had memory now and sight of other instances and of other comings together which had some confusion and but half meanings to me yet of this our present age and life we spoke as of some yesterday but very hallowed now as may be conceived the wonder of this surety which had come into my life stirred me fiercely to its completion for all my heart and spirit cried out to be with that one who was mirdath and now spoke with the voice of naani yet how should this be won for none among all the learned men of that mighty pyramid knew the position of the lesser redoubt neither could the records and histories of the world give us that knowledge only that there was a general thought among the students and the monstruwacans that it lay between the north west and the north east but no man had any surety neither could any conceive of the distance from us of that refuge and counting all this there was yet the incredible danger and peril of the night land and the hunger and desolation of the outer lands which were sometimes named the unknown lands and i spoke much with naani concerning this matter of their position yet neither she nor her father the master monstruwacan of that refuge had any knowing either of our position only that the builder of the lesser redoubt had come out of the southward world in the beginning as they had knowledge of by the records also the father of naani set that ancient compass to bear for as he made explanation to us through the instrument so great a power of the earth current must be ours that perchance it was our force which did affect the pointer from steadfastness for indeed the needle did swing in an arc as we heard that held between the north and the south within the westward arc but this it had done ever with them and so was a very helpless guide save that maybe as we had thought the force of the earth current that was with us had in truth some power to pull the needle towards us and if this were so of verity we made a reckoning that set the lesser redoubt to the north and they did likewise and put us to the south yet was it all built upon the sand of guess work and nothing to adventure the life and soul upon now we of curiosity though a million times had it been done in the past ages set the compass before us having it from the great museum but as ever in that age it did spin if we but stirred the needle and would stop nowheres with surety for the flow of the earth current from the crack beneath the pyramid had a power to affect it away from the north and to set it wandering and this may seem very strange to this present age yet to that it was most true to the seeming nature of things and harder to believe that ever it did once point steadfastly to prove a guide of sureness and unfailing for be it known we knew the positions of the land by tradition coming from that ancient time when in the half gloom they had builded the pyramid they having known the use of that ancient compass and with sight of the sun had named the positions though we of that far future day had forgotten the very beginnings of those names of direction and used them but because our fathers did a million years and more and likewise we did the same with the names of the day and the night and the weeks and the months and the years though of the visible markings of these there was nothing but only and always the everlasting night yet the same seeming very natural to that people now naani having heed to my constant questions craved with an utter keen hunger that i might come to her but yet forbade it in that it were better to live and commune in the spirit than to risk my soul and mayhaps die in the foolishness of trying to find her in all the darkness of the dead world yet no heed had i taken of her commands had i but known of a surety the direction in which she might be discovered and gained some knowledge of the space between for this might be named by thousands of miles or but by hundreds though a great distance it was surely yet one other thing there was that has point in this place for when i sent my speech out into the night using my brain elements i came to know that whether i had a knowledge of the north or no knowledge at the moment yet did i turn oft with a sure instinction to that direction and of this the master monstruwacan took very great note and had me to experiment many a time and way and so enclosed about with screens or with bandages across mine eyes that i could not save by that inward knowing have any knowledge to point me the way yet would i turn northwards very frequent by a certain feeling and seemed unable of speech if i were turned otherwise by force but when we asked naani whether she had an unusualness in this matter she could discover none and we could but take note curiously of that which affected my habits and which truly i set to the attracting of her spirit for i had mind that she did be somewheres out that way in the darkness of the world but yet was this no more than to suppose as you perceive and the master monstruwacan wrote a study of this matter of the northwardness of my turning and it was set out in the hour slips of the tower of observation and so it came to be copied by the hour slips of the great cities and made much comment and much calling up to me through the home instruments so that with this and the speech that went about concerning my powers to hear i was much in talk and diversely pleased and oft angered by overmuch attention and importunity and now whilst i pondered this matter in all my spirit and being how that i should some way come to naani there befell a very terrible thing and in this wise must i tell it it was at the seventeenth hour when all the millions of the mighty pyramid slept that i was with the master monstruwacan in the tower of observation taking my due turn and sudden i heard the thrilling of the aether all about me and the voice of naani in my soul speaking and i sent the master word into the darkness of the world and presently i heard the solemn answer beating steadfastly in the night and immediately i called to naani with my brain elements to know what thing troubled her in her sleep and her voice came into my spirit weak and far and faint and so that scarce i could make to hear the words yet in a while i gathered that all the peoples of the lesser redoubt were in very deadly trouble for that the earth current had failed suddenly and mightily and they had called her from her sleep that she might listen whether we answered their callings by the instrument but indeed no calling had come to us and they who had been of late so joyful were now grown old with sorrow in but an hour or two for they feared that the fresh coming of the earth current had been but the final flicker and outburst before the end and even in this short while of our speech did it seem to me that the voice of naani grew further off from me and i felt like to have broken my heart with the trouble of this thing and through all that remained of that sleep time did i converse with naani as might two lovers who shall presently part forever and when the cities awoke the news went throughout them and all our millions were in sorrow and trouble and thus was it for maybe a little month and in that time had the voice of naani grown so weak and far off that even i that had the night hearing could scarce make real its meaning and every word was to me a treasure and a touch upon my soul and my grief and trouble before this certain parting drove me that i could not eat neither have rest and this did the master monstruwacan take upon him to chide and correct for that if any were to help how should it be done if i that had the night hearing and heard even now that the recording instruments were dumb came to ill health and because of this and such wisdom as was mine i made to eat and order my life that i might have my full powers yet was this beyond all my strength for presently i knew that the people of the lesser pyramid were threatened by the monsters that beset them and later i had knowledge from faint far words whispered in my brain that there had been a fight with an outside force that had harmed many in their minds so that in madness they had opened the gate and had run from the lesser pyramid out into the darkness of the lands about them and there had their physical bodies fallen to the monsters of those lands but of their souls who may know and this we set assuredly to the failure of the earth current which had robbed them of all force and power so that in those few weeks all life and joy of living had left them and neither hunger nor thirst had they much nor any great desire to live but yet a new and mighty fear of death and this doth seem very strange and as may be thought all this made the peoples of the great redoubt think newly of the earth current that issued from the crack beneath the pyramid and of their latter end so that much was writ in the hour slips concerning this matter yet in the main to assure us that we ourselves might each be free from a disturbed heart though some went foolishly to the other event and spoke of a speedy danger to us likewise as is ever the way but the truth of our own case lay maybe somewhere between and all the hour slips were full also of imaginings of the terror of those poor humans out in the darkness of the world facing that end which must come upon all even upon our mighty pyramid though as most would believe so far away in some future eternity that we have no cause to trouble and there were sad poems writ to the peoples of that lesser redoubt and foolish plans set about to rescue them but none to put them to effect and no way by which so great a thing might be done and doth but show how loosely people will speak out of an over security yet to me there had come a certain knowledge that i must make the adventure though i achieved naught save mine own end yet it were better to cease quickly than that i should feel as now i did feel that same night in the eighteenth hour there was a great disturbance in the aether about the mighty pyramid and i was awakened suddenly by the master monstruwacan that i might use my gift of the night hearing to hearken for the throbbing of the master word which they had thought to come vaguely through the instruments but no one of the monstruwacans was sensitive enough of soul to account truly whether this was so and lo as i sat up in the bed there came the sound of the master word beating in the night about the pyramid and immediately there was a crying in the aether all about me we are coming we are coming and mine inwards leaped and sickened me a moment so shaken was i with a sudden belief for the message seemed some ways to come to me from very near to the great redoubt as that they who sent it were nigh to hand and forthwith i called the master word into the night but no answer did there come for a while and then a faint thrilling of the aether about me and the weak pulse of the master word in the night sent by a far voice strangely distant and i knew that the voice was the voice of naani and i put a question through all the darkness of the dead world whether she were within the lesser redoubt and safe thus far and presently there came a faint disturbance about me and a small voice in my soul speaking weakly and out of an infinite distance and i knew that far away through the night naani spoke feebly with her brain elements and that she abode within the lesser pyramid but that she too had heard that strange pulse of the master word in the night and that message we are coming we are coming and vastly had this thing disturbed her waking her within her sleep so that she knew not what to think save that we were devising some method to come to them but this i removed from doubt saying that she must not build on vain hoping for i would not have her doubly tortured by the vanity of such believing and thereafter having said such things as i might though few they were to comfort her i bade her gently to sleep and turned therewith to the master monstruwacan who waited in quiet patience and had no knowledge of that which i had heard and sent for his hearing was but the normal though his brain and heart were such as made me to love him and i told the master monstruwacan many things as i put my clothing about me how that there had indeed been the calling of the master word but not by any of that lesser redoubt but that to my belief it had come from nigh about the great pyramid moreover it was sent by no instrument as i wotted that he did guess but as it seemed to me by the brain elements of many calling in unison and all this did i set out to the master monstruwacan and with something uncertain of fear and trouble in my heart yet with a blind expectation as indeed who would not though no longer was i shaken by that first thought of her nearness and i said to the master monstruwacan that we should go to the tower of observation and search the night lands with the great spy glass and we did this and lo presently we saw a great number of men pass over the electric circle that went about the pyramid yet they came not to us but went outwards towards the blackness and the strange fires and hideous mysteries of the night land and we ceased from spying and looked swiftly at one another and knew in our hearts that some had left the mighty pyramid in the sleep time then the master monstruwacan sent word to the master watchman that his wardership had been outraged and that people left the great pyramid in the sleep time for this was against the law and none ever went out into the night land save the full watch were posted to the great door and at a due time when all were wakeful for the opening of the door was made known to all the millions of the great redoubt so that all might be aware and know that no foolishness was done without their wotting moreover ere any had power to leave the pyramid they must pass the examination and be prepared and some of this have i set out already and so stern was the framing of the law that there were yet the metal pegs upon the inner side of the great gate where had been stretched the skin of one who disobeyed and was flayed and his hide set there to be a warning in the early days yet the tradition was remembered for as i might say it we lived very close about the place and memory had no room whereby she might escape now the master watchman when he heard that which the master monstruwacan had to tell went hastily with some of the central watch from the watch dome to the great gate and he found the men of the sleep time watch with the warder of the gate all bound and stopt in the mouth so that none could make outcry and he freed them and learned that nigh five hundred young men from the upper cities by the bigness of their chests had come upon them suddenly and bound them and escaped into the night through the eye gate in the top of the great gate and the master watchman was angry and demanded why that none had called by the instruments of the watch house but lo some had made to call thus and found them unable to wake the recorders which lay in the central watch dome for there had been tampering now after this they made certain new rules and laws concerning the order of watching and made tests of the lesser instruments of the inward pyramid nightly upon the coming of the sleep time which was even in that strange age by tradition called the night as i have given hint though hitherto until the way of my story was known i have used a word for the sleep hours that was yet not of that time but somewhat an invention to make this history free from the confusion of night and day when in truth it was always night without upon the world yet after this shall i keep to mine use the luxury of the true names of that time and yet how strange is it that the truth should be of so little to our thinking and so to go forward with my telling for though all this care were now taken it had no force until afterward and at this moment were those poor foolish youths out in all the danger of the night land and no way by which they might be succoured or called back save that fear or wisdom should come to them quickly that they cease from so wild an attempt for it was to make rescue of those in that other unknown pyramid out in all the darkness of the world's night that was their intent as we had speedy knowledge from those boon friends that had been in the secret of their plot which had seemed to them great and heroic and was so in verity but that neither they who went nor they who stayed had a true awaredness of the danger they had dealing with being all naught but raw and crude youths yet doubtless with the makings of many fine and great men among them and because some had thus abetted that which they knew to be against the law which was framed to the well being and safety of all there were certain floggings which might the better help their memories in the future as to the properness of their actions and wisdom moreover they who returned if any would be flogged as seemed proper after due examination and though the news of their beatings might help all others to hesitation ere they did foolishly in like fashion yet was the principle of the flogging not on this base which would be both improper and unjust but only that the one in question be corrected to the best advantage for his own well being for it is not meet that any principle of correction should shape to the making of human signposts of pain for the benefit of others for in verity this were to make one pay the cost of many's learning and each should owe to pay only so much as shall suffice for the teaching of his own body and spirit and if others profit thereby this is but accident however helpful and this is wisdom and denoteth now that a sound principle shall prevent practice from becoming monstrous yet now i must hasten that i set down how it fared with those five hundred youths that had made so sad an adventure of their lives and unprepared souls and were beyond our aid to help them who might not so much as make any calling to them to bid them to return for to do this would have been to tell to all the monsters of the land that humans were abroad from the mighty pyramid and this would have been to cause the monsters to search the youths out to their destruction and maybe even to awaken the forces to work them some dread spiritual harm which was the chief fear now presently through all the cities of the great redoubt the news had gone how that five hundred foolish youths had adventured out into the despair of the night land and the whole pyramid waked to life and the peoples of the south came to the northern sides for the great gate lay in the north west side and the youths had made from there not straightly outwards but towards the north and so were to be seen from the north east embrasures and from those within the north west wall and thus in a while were they watched by all the mighty multitudes of the great pyramid through millions of spy glasses for each human had a spying glass as may be thought and some were an hundred years old and some maybe ten thousand and handed down through many generations and some but newly made and very strange but all those people had some instrument by which they might spy out upon the wonder of the night land for so had it been ever through all the eternity of darkness and a great diversion and wonder of life was it to behold the monsters about their work and to know that they plotted always to our destruction yet were ever foiled and never did all that great and terrible land grow stale upon the soul of any from birth until death and by this you shall know the constant wonder of it and that sense of enemies in the night about us which ever filled the heart and spirit of all beholders so that never were the embrasures utterly empty yet many beheld not the land from the embrasures but sat about the view tables which were set properly in certain places throughout the cities and so beheld the night land without undue cranings or poising of spy glasses though less plain seen and these same tables were some form of that which we of this age name camera obscura but made very great and with inventions and low to the floor so that ten thousand people might sit about them in the raised galleries and have comfortable sight yet this attracted not the young people save they were lovers and then in truth were they comfortable seats for quietness and gentle whisperings yet now as may be supposed with all the peoples of the mighty pyramid grown eager to look towards one part of the night land the embrasures were hid in the crowds and such as could gain no view therethrough thronged about the view tables and so was it in all the hours of leisure so that women had scarce patience to attend their children but must hasten to watch again that lonesome band of foolish youths making so blind and unshaped a trial to come upon that unknown lesser redoubt somewhere out in all the night of the world and in this wise passed three days and nights yet both in the sleep time and the time of waking did great multitudes cease not to watch so that many went hungry for sleep as in truth did i and sometimes we saw those youths with plainness but other times they were lost to our sight in the utter shadows of the night land yet by the telling of our instruments and the sense of my hearing there was no awaredness among the monsters and the forces of evil that any were abroad from the pyramid so that a little hope came into our hearts that yet there might be no tragedy and times would they cease from their way and sit about in circles among the shadows and the grey moss bushes which grew hardly here or there about and we knew that they had food with them to eat for this could we see with plainness as some odd grim flare of light from the infernal fires struck upon one or another strangely and passed and left them in the darkness and who of you shall conceive what was in the hearts of the fathers and the mothers that bore the youths and who never ceased away from the northward embrasures but spied out in terror and in tears and maybe oft with so good glasses as did show them the very features and look upon the face of son and son and the kin of the watchers brought to them food and tended them so that they had no need to cease from their watching and beds were made in the embrasures rough and resourceful that they might sleep quickly a little yet be ever ready if those cruel monsters without made discovery of those their children thrice in those three days of journeying to the northward did the youths sleep and we perceived that some kept a watch and so knew that there was a kind of order and leadership among them also they had each his weapon upon his hip and this gave to us a further plea to hope and concerning this same carrying of weapons i can but set out here that no healthful male or female in all the mighty pyramid but possessed such a weapon and was trained to it from childhood so that a ripe and extraordinary skill in the use thereof was common to most yet some breaking of rule had there been that the youths had each achieved to be armed for the weapons were stored in every tenth house of the cities in the care of the charging masters and here i must make known that these weapons did not shoot but had a disk of grey metal sharp and wonderful that spun in the end of a rod of grey metal and were someways charged by the earth current so that were any but stricken thereby they were cut in twain so easy as aught and the weapons were contrived to the repelling of any army of monsters that might make to win entrance to the redoubt and to the eye they had somewhat the look of strange battle axes and might be lengthened by the pulling out of the handles now the youths made as i have told to the northward but had first to keep a long way to the north east that they might come clear of the vale of red fire and this wise they journeyed and kept the vale about seven miles to the north west of them and so were presently beyond the watcher of the north east and going with a greater freedom and having less care to hide and this way it may be certain of the giants wandering perceived them and went swiftly to make attack and destroy them but some order went about among the youths and they made a long line with a certain space between each because of the terror of their weapon and immediately it seemed the giants were upon them a score and seven they were and seeming to be haired like to mighty crabs as i saw with the great spy glass when the great flares of far and mighty fires threw their fierce light across the dark lands and there was a very great and horrid fight for the youths broke into circles about each of the giants and many of those young men were torn in pieces but they smote the monsters from behind and upon every side and we of the mighty pyramid could behold at times the grey strange gleam of their weapons and the jether was stirred about me by the passing of those that died yet by reason of the great miles their screams came not to us neither heard we the roars of the monsters but into our hearts even from that great distance and safety there stole the terror of those awesome brutes and in the great spy glass i could behold the great joints and limbs and e'en i thought the foul sweat of them and their size and brutishness was like to that of odd and monstrous animals of the olden world yet part human and it must be borne to mind that the fathers and the mothers of those youths beheld all this dread fight from the embrasures and their other kin likewise watched and a very drear sight was it to their hearts and their human natural feelings and like to breed old age ere its due then in a time the fight ceased for of those seven and twenty giant brutes there remained none only that there cumbered the ground seven and twenty lumbering hillocks dreadful and grim for the lesser dead we could not see proper and we that were within the pyramid saw the youths sorted together by their leaders all in the dim twilight of that place and with the great spy glass i made a rough count and found that there lived of them three hundred and by this shall you know the power of those few monstrous things which had slain full two hundred though each youth was armed with so wondrous a weapon and i set the word through the pyramid that all might have some knowledge of the number that had died for it was better to know than to be in doubt and no spy glass had the power of the great spy glass after this fight the youths spent a time having a care to their bodies and wounds and some were made separate from the others and of these i counted upon fifty and whilst the others made to continue their march towards the road where the silent ones walk these were constrained by one who was the leader to return to the pyramid and in a little i saw that they came towards us wearily and with many a halt as that they suffered great wounds and harm of the fight but those others maybe two hundred and fifty youths went onwards into the night land and though we sorrowed at this thing yet was there come a huge pride into our hearts that those raw ones who yesterday were but children had so held themselves in the battle and done a great deed that day and i wot that whilst their mothers wept easeless their fathers' hearts swelled within them and held somewhat of their pain away from them for a time and all this while those wounded youths came slowly and rested and came on again the better helping the worse and a great excitement and trouble there was in all the mighty pyramid to learn which were they that came and they that went and who lay out there quietly among the slain but none might say anything with surety for even with that great spy glass in the tower of observation they were not overplain save when some light from the fires of the land flared high and lit them for they stood not up into the glare of the fires as had the giants and though i saw them with clearness yet i knew them not for there was so mighty a multitude in that vast redoubt that none might ever know the half even of their rulers and about this time there came a fresh matter of trouble to our minds for one of the monstruwacans made report that the instruments were recording an influence abroad in the night so that we had knowledge that one of the evil forces was out and to me there came an awaredness that a strange unquiet stole over the land yet i knew it not with mine ears but my spirit heard and it was as though trouble and an expectation of horror did swarm about me and once listening i heard the master word beating strangely low and i knew the aether to thrill about me and a faint stirring was there in my soul as of a faint voice speaking and i knew that naani called to me some message across the night of the world yet weak and coming without clear meaning so that i was tormented and could but send comfort to her with my brain elements and presently i knew that she ceased to speak and later i heard that there was a new matter forward in the redoubt for ten thousand men had assembled to attend the room of preparation for the short preparation and by this we knew that those poor youths who stumbled towards us through the dark were presently to have help and through all that sleep time there went forward the spiritual and the physical preparation of the ten thousand and upon the morrow they slept whilst an hundred thousand made ready their arms and in this space of time the two hundred and fifty youths that went towards the road where the silent ones walk had come very nigh thereto having gone very warily and with some slowness because as may be of the lesson of the giants and to us in the pyramid the instruments made known constantly that influence which was abroad and which all those of the tower of observation thought to proceed from the house of silence yet nothing could we see with the great spy glass and so could come to no sure knowing but only to fear and wonder and presently the youths were upon the great road and turned to the northward and beyond them a great way stood the house of silence upon a low hill at a certain distance to the right of the road by now they that were wounded had come to within maybe fifteen miles of the great redoubt and the news went through all the cities that the ten thousand men that were prepared made to arm themselves and i went down by the tower lift and saw them come down by thousands from the room of preparation and none might go nigh to them or cause them to speak for they were made ready and were as it might be holy and all the millions of the mighty pyramid stood in their cities about certain of the main lifts and watched those thousands go downwards all in their armour of grey metal and each one armed with the diskos which was that same very terrible weapon which all had training to and i doubt not but that the young men of the pyramid looked with longing in their hearts that they might have been among those that went forth to succour yet the older men had graver thoughts in their hearts for the blood ran more soberly in them and they had knowledge and memory of the peril and by this i would make clear that i speak less of the peril of the body which is common to every state of life but of the peril of the spirit and it may be thought by those of this age that it was most strange that they of that having all the knowledge of eternity to aid them had no weapon by which to shoot and kill at a distance but indeed this had not been so in the past as our histories did show for some wondrous weapons there had been that might slay without sound or flash at a full score miles and more and some we had whole within the great museum and of others but the parts in decay for they had been foolish things and reckless to use for we of that great pyramid wanted not to kill a few of the monsters that lay at a great distance but only those which came nigh to harm us and concerning those same weapons that killed silently at a great distance we had now little knowledge save that they did waste the earth current and no practice had we concerning their workings for it was maybe an hundred thousand years gone that they had been used and found to be of no great worth in a close attack and harmful otherwise to the peace in that they angered unneedful the forces of that land slaying wantonly those monsters which did no more than beset the mighty redoubt at a great distance for as may be seen by a little thought we did very gladly keep a reasonable quietness and refrained from aught that should wake that land for we were born to the custom of that strange life and lived and died in peace for the most part and were very content to have security and to be neutral in all things that did not overbear us but as it were always armed and ready but concerning the great and evil forces that were abroad in the night land these we had no power to harm nor could we hope for more than that we had security from them which indeed we had but the hugeness of their power was about us and we dared not to wake it save through such extremity as had come to pass by this folly of the youths though even now we had no thought to attack aught but only to succour those wounded ones and concerning this simplicity of weapons which excites somewhat even my wonder in this our present age it may be that the powers of chemistry were someways quaintly limited by conditions in that age and there to be always a need to spare the earth current and hence by this cause and by that we were brought by the extreme nigh to the simplicity of the early world yet with a strange and mighty difference as all may know who have read now presently the word was sent to every city throughout the great redoubt as was the law that the great gate should be opened and each city sent its master to form the full watch as was the law and each went clad in grey armour and carrying the diskos and the full watch numbered two thousand for there were also the watchmen then the lights in the great causeway were made dim so that the opening of the gate should cast no great glare from within into the night land to tell the watcher of the north west and all the monsters that certain humans went out from the mighty pyramid but whether the vast and hidden forces of evil had knowledge we knew not and they who went must but chance it remembering that they were prepared and had the capsule and the ten thousand that were prepared went out through the great gateway into the night and the full watch stood back from them and spoke no word but saluted silently with the diskos and they that went raised each the diskos a little and passed out into the dark then the great gate was shut and we made to wait and to watch with trouble and expectation within our hearts and at the embrasures many did comfort the women of those men and i went back upwards by miles until i came to the tower of observation and i looked out from there into the night land and saw that the ten thousand halted at the circle and made arrangement of themselves and sent some before and upon either hand and so went forward into the night land and after that i went to the great spy glass and turned it towards the two hundred and fifty youths that were far off upon the road where the silent ones walk yet for awhile i could not perceive them for all the road seemed empty but afterward i saw them and they were clambering back into the road having gone aside as i thought because of the passing of one of those silent ones that i saw now at a distance to the southward of them there passed then some three hours and in that time i varied my watching between those far off youths and the ten thousand that went forward to succour the wounded that were now maybe scarce nine miles distant from the mighty pyramid and the ten thousand came very close to them and in truth in a little while they spied one the other and i gathered in spirit something of the rejoicing of those youths yet weak and troubled were they because of their wounds and their knowledge of failure and their disobedience of the law and presently they were surrounded by the ten thousand and carried upon slings and all that body swung round towards the pyramid and came back at a great pace and in the same time i heard the sound that made them so swift to hasten for there smote up through the night the baying of the hounds and we knew that they were discovered and i swept the great spy glass over the land towards the valley of the hounds that i might discover them quickly and i saw them come lumbering at a strange gallop and great as horses and it might be only ten miles to the east and i looked once upon the watcher of the north east and i saw and marvelled that the great bell ear quivered constantly and i knew that it had knowledge and gave signal to all the land then did one of the monstruwacans report that a new and terrible influence was abroad in the land and by the instrument we had knowledge that it approached and some of the monstruwacans called foolishly with weak voices to the ten thousand to haste forgetting and desiring only their safety from that which came near then looking with the great spy glass i saw that there moved across the land from the direction of the plain of blue fire a mighty hump seeming of black mist and came with prodigious swiftness and i called to the master monstruwacan that he come and look through one of the eye pieces that were about the great spy glass and he came quickly and when he had looked a while he called to the monstruwacan that had made report and the monstruwacan answered and replied that the influence drew nearer by the reading of the instrument yet of the thing itself the man had no sight and i ceased not to look and in a little while the humped thing passed downwards into the vale of red fire which lay across the land that way but i watched steadfastly and presently i saw the black hump climb up from the vale of red fire upon this side and come through the night so that in scarce a minute it had come halfway across that part of the night land and my heart stood quiet with fear and the utter terror of this monster which i knew to be surely one of the great forces of evil of that land and had power without doubt to destroy the spirit and the master monstruwacan leapt towards the home call and sent the great sound down to the ten thousand that they might attend and immediately he signalled to them to beware yet already i perceived that they knew of this utter danger that was upon them for i saw them slay the youths quickly that their spirits might not be lost for they were unprepared but the men being prepared had the capsule and would die swiftly in the last moment i looked again towards the hump and saw that it came like a hill of blackness in the land and was almost anigh then there happened a wonder for in that moment when all had else gone quickly that they might save their souls out of the earth there rose a little light like to the crescent of the young moon of this early day and the crescent rose up into an arch of bright and cold fire glowing but little and it spanned above the ten thousand and the dead and the hump stood still and went backwards and was presently lost and the men came swiftly towards the mighty pyramid yet ere they were come to safety the baying of the hounds sounded close upon them and they faced to the danger yet as i could know without despair because that they yet lived after so enormous a peril and the hounds were very nigh as now i beheld with the great spy glass and i counted five score running with mighty heads low and in a pack and lo as the hounds came at them the ten thousand drew apart and had a space between the men that they might have full use of that terrible diskos and they fought with the handles at length and i saw the disks spin and glisten and send out fire then was there a very great battle for the light that arched above them and held away the power from their souls made not to protect them from this danger of the lesser monsters and at an hundred thousand embrasures within the mighty pyramid the women cried and sobbed and looked again and in the lower cities it was told after that the peoples could hear the crash and splinter of the armour as the hounds ran to and fro slaying aye even the sound of the armour between their teeth yet the ten thousand ceased not to smite with the diskos and they hewed the hounds in pieces but of the men that went forth there were a thousand and seven hundred slain by the hounds ere the men won to victory then came that wearied band of heroes back to the home shelter of the vast redoubt and they bore their dead with them and the youths that they slew and they were received with great honour and with exceeding grief and in a great silence for the thing admitted not of words until a time had passed and in the cities of the pyramid there was mourning for there had been no sorrow like unto this through mayhap an hundred thousand years and they bore the youths to their mothers and to their fathers and the father of each made thanks to the men that they had saved the soul of his son but the women were silent yet neither to the father nor to the mother was ever made known the name of the slayers for this might not be as all shall see with a little thought and some did remember that in verity all was due to the unwisdom of those youths who had heeded not the law and their life teachings yet had they paid to the uttermost and passed outwards and the account of their deeds was closed and all this while did great numbers spy toward the road where the silent ones walk that they might watch that band of youths afar in the night land who went forward amid those horrid dangers yet when the dead youths had been brought in many had ceased to look out for a time and had turned to questioning and some had made inspection that they might know which had come back and which lay out there where the giants had slain them or went forward to more dreadful matters but who of those that were abroad were slain or still went onward we had but indifferent knowledge though the men of the ten thousand knew somewhat having had speech with the wounded youths ere they slew them and as may be thought these men were sorely questioned by the mothers and the fathers of those youths that were not accounted of yet i doubt that few had much knowledge wherewith to console them now there was presently in the garden of silence which was the lowermost of all the underground fields the ending of those seventeen hundred heroes and of the youths that they saved and slew and the garden was a great country and an hundred miles every way and the roof thereof was three great miles above and shaped to a mighty dome as it had been that the builders and makers thereof did remember in their spirits the visible sky of this our present age and the making of that country was all set out in a single history of seven thousand and seventy volumes and there were likewise seven thousand and seventy years spent to the making of that country so that there had unremembered generations lived and laboured and died and seen not the end of their labour and love had shaped it and hallowed it so that of all the wonders of the world there has been none that shall ever come anigh to that country of silence an hundred miles every way of silence to the dead and there were in that roof seven moons set in a mighty circle and lit by the earth current and the circle was sixty miles across so that all that country of quiet was visible yet to no great glare but a sweet and holy light so that i did always feel in my heart that a man might weep there and be unashamed and in the midst of that silent country there was a great hill and upon the hill a vast dome and the dome was full of a light that might be seen in all that country which was the garden of silence and beneath the dome was the crack and within it the glory of the earth current from which all had life and light and safety and in the dome at the north there was a gateway and a narrow road went upward to the gateway and the road was named the last road and the gateway was named by no name but known to all as the gateway and there were in that mighty country long roadways and hidden methods to help travel and constant temples of rest along the miles and groves and the charm of water falling and everywhere the statues of memory and the tablets of memory and the whole of that great underground country full of an echo of eternity and of memory and love and greatness so that to walk alone in that land was to grow back to the wonder and mystery of childhood and presently to go upwards again to the cities of the mighty pyramid purified and sweetened of soul and mind and in my boyhood i have wandered oft a week of days in that country of silence and had my food with me and slept quietly amid the memories and gone on again wrapped about with the quiet of the everlasting and the man soul within would be drawn mightily to those places where the great ones of the past eternity of the world had their memory named but there was that within me which ever drew me in the ending to the hills of the babes those little hills where might be heard amid the lonesomeness of an utter quiet a strange and wondrous echo as of a little child calling over the hills but how this was i know not save by the sweet cunning of some dead maker in the forgotten years and here mayhaps by reason of this voice of pathos were to be found the countless tokens of memory to all the babes of the mighty pyramid through a thousand ages and odd whiles would i come upon some mother sitting there lonely or mayhaps companied by others and by this little telling shall you know somewhat of the quietness and the wonder and the holiness of that great country hallowed to all memory and to eternity and to our dead and it was here into the country of silence that they brought down the dead to their burial and there came down into the country of silence maybe an hundred million out of the cities of the pyramid to be present and to do honour now they that had charge of the dead did lay them upon the road which ran up unto the gateway even that same road which was named the last road and the road moved upwards slowly with the dead and the dead went inward through the gateway first the poor youths and afterward they that had given up life that they might save them and as the dead went upwards there was a very great silence over all the miles of the country of silence but in a little while there came from afar off a sound as of a wind wailing and it came onwards out of the distance and passed over the hills of the babes which were a great way off and so came anigh to the place where i stood even as the blowing of a sorrowful wind did it come and i knew that all the great multitudes did sing quietly and the singing passed onwards and left behind it an utter silence even as the wind doth rustle the corn and pass onwards and all fall to a greater seeming quietness than before and the dead passed inward through the gateway into the great light and silence of the dome and came out no more and again from beyond the far hills of the babes there was that sound of the millions singing and there rose up out of the earth beneath the voices of the underground organs and the noise of the sorrow passed over me and went again into the distance and left all hushed and lo as there passed inward to the silence of the dome the last of those dead heroes there came again the sound from beyond the hills of the babes and as it came more nigh i knew that it was the song of honour loud and triumphant and sung by countless multitudes and the voices of the organs rose up into thunder from the deep earth and there was a great honour done to the glory of the dead and afterwards once more a silence then did the peoples of the cities arrange themselves so that from every city whence had come a hero were the people of that city gathered together and when they were so gathered they set up tokens of memory to the dead of their city but afterwards did charge artists to the making of sculpture great and beautiful to that same end and now did but place tablets against that time and afterwards the people did wander over that country of silence and made visit and honour to their ancestors if such were deserving and presently the mighty lifts did raise them all to the cities of the pyramid and thereafter there was something more of usualness save that ever the embrasures were full of those that watched the youths afar upon the great road and in this place i to remember how that our spy glasses had surely some power of the earth current to make greater the impulse of the light upon the eye and they were like no spy glass that ever you did see but oddly shaped and to touch both the forehead and the eyes and gave wonderful sight of the land but the great spy glass to be beyond all this for it had the eyes of it upon every side of the mighty pyramid and did be truly an huge machine and to me as i went about my duties or peered forth through the great spy glass at the youths upon the road where the silent ones walk there came at times a far faint thrilling of the aether so that sometimes i was aware that there was the beating of the master word in the night but so strange and weak that the instruments had no wotting of it and when this came then would i call back through all the everlasting night to naani who was indeed mirdath and i would send the master word with my brain elements and afterwards such comfort as i might yet hard and bitter was the truth of my helplessness and weakness and the utter terror and might of the evil forces and monsters of the night land so that i was like to have brake my heart with pondering and the silence would come again and anon the weak thrilling of the aether but no more the far voice speaking in my soul v into the night land now after that destruction which had come upon the ten thousand and the fresh assurance that was upon us of the terror of the night land it may be known that there could be no more thought to succour though in truth those youths that went now upon the road where the silent ones walk were far beyond our aid yet might it be thought that we should have signalled to them calling by the home call which was that great voice which went forth from the machine above the sealed base of the mighty pyramid but this we might not do for then we gave signal to the monsters of that land that some were even now abroad from the pyramid yet we could no more than hope that the evil forces had no wotting of them for in verity none might ever know the knowledge or the ignorance which those powers did possess yet it must be kept to the mind that we knew even then there was an influence abroad in the land strange and quiet so that the instruments did not more than make record of it and as i have surely set down ere now we had belief that it did come from that house of silence afar in the night land upon that low hill to the north of the great road and many among the monstruwacans feared that it was directed upon the youths but of this there could be no surety and we could but wait and watch now about this time those poor youths did draw nigh to that part of the road where the silent ones walk where it turned more swiftly to the north and they to be now at no mighty distance from that grim and horrid house and presently we knew that the influence had a greater power in the land and i had an assuredness that it came from the house yet no certain proof was this but i set out my feelings to the master monstruwacan and he had trust in them and in my power moreover he also had belief within himself that some secret power came out from the house of silence and some talk there was at times that we send the home call into the night to give warning to the youths of our knowledge and our fear and to entreat them to make a safe endeavour to return swiftly yet was this an error and refused by the master monstruwacan for it was not meet that we put the souls of those youths in peril until such time as we had certainty that they should be lost if we did not bestir ourselves for indeed this home call was as a mighty voice calling over the world and did have so exceeding a noise that it had immediately told all that land how that some were yet abroad from the great redoubt and here will i set down how that the home call had no use in those ages but had been a call in the olden time when yet the great flying ships went abroad over the world and there passed now a day and a night and in all that time there ceased not great multitudes to peer forth into the night land at the youths for it was known concerning the influence and all felt that the youths did draw nigh very speedy to their fate and much talk there was and many things said and much foolish speech and kind intent but no courage to go forth to make further attempt to rescue which in truth calls not for great astonishment as i have surely writ or oft thought and in this place let me set down that the land was as it might be said waked and unquiet and a sense of things passing in the night and of horrid watchfulness and there were at this time and at that low roars that went across the land and if i have not told the same before this time it must be set to count against me and my telling for indeed i should have writ it down before this place yet is the difficulty of my task great and all must bear with me and entreat for me that i have courage so that i may come at last to strength and wisdom to tell all that i did see now in the space of this day and night it was known that the youths had not slept neither had they eaten save once as they who had the watch through the great spy glass did affirm but they to hasten alway at a woeful speed towards the north along that great dismal road so that presently they must cease or slay themselves with their endeavour and all this did give surety to our fears that they were under a spell from that horrid house afar in the land and we had an assurance that this thing was for presently there came a monstruwacan to the master monstruwacan to report that there had come sudden a mighty influence into the land and in the same moment as it might be i spied through the great spy glass and did see those youths break swiftly from the road where the silent ones walk and begin to run very swift that they might come quickly to the house of silence then did the master monstruwacan hesitate not but did send the home call across the world aye even to those poor doomed ones that hastened unknowing to the terror which did compel them and immediately upon the sound the master did send a message to the natural eye in set language and made warning that they suffered themselves to be drawn to their destruction by a force that came from within the house of silence and he besought them to put forth the strength of their spirits and do battle for their souls and if they could in no wise compass a victory over that which drew them onwards to slay themselves quickly ere they went into that house to the horror of utter destruction and in all the pyramid was there a great silence for the bellowing of the home call bred a quietness because of that which it did portend and it was swiftly known by the millions that the master monstruwacan did plead for the souls of the youths and there went forth unknowingly a counter force from the mighty pyramid by reason of the prayers and soul wishings of the countless millions and the counter force was plain to my inward hearing and beat all the aether of the world into a surge of supplication so that it stunned my spirit with the great power of it and it seemed to me as it were that there was a vast spiritual noise in all the night and i spied tremblingly through the great spy glass and lo the youths did cease from their swift running and were come together in a crowd and had a seeming to be confused as might some who have waked suddenly from sleep to find that they walked in their sleep and had come to a strange place then came there a great roar from all the millions that spied from the embrasures from nigh five hundred thousand embrasures they did look and i count not the great view tables and the shouting rose up like to the roaring of a mighty wind of triumph yet was it over early to sound for victory for the counter force which came from the intensity of so many wills blent to one intent was brake and the evil force which came forth out of the house did draw the youths again so that they heeded not their salvation but turned once again to their running and the mighty pyramid was full of a shaken silence and immediately of lamentation and sorrow and horror at this thing but in that moment there did happen a fresh wonder for there grew suddenly before those poor youths billows of mist as it had been of pure white fire shining very chill yet giving no light upon them and the mist of cold fire stayed their way so that we had knowledge that there fought for the souls of them one of those sweet powers of goodness which we had belief did strive to ward our spirits at all times from those forces of evil and destruction and all the millions saw the thing but some with a great clearness and many doubtful yet were all advanced more in spiritual sight and hearing than the normal peoples of this age but of them all none had the night hearing to know a soul having speech in the aether half across the world yet as i have said some there had been aforetime who were thus given the hearing even as was i and there came a monstruwacan to the master monstruwacan to make report that the influence had ceased to work upon the instruments and by this thing we knew that in verity the force which proceeded out from the house of silence was cut off from us and from those youths and we had assurance that there fought a very mighty power for the salvation of the souls of the youths and all the peoples were silent save for an underbreath of wonder and talk for all were utter stirred with hope and fear perceiving that the youths had some chance given unto them to return and whilst the youths yet wavered in their minds as i perceived with the great spy glass and the knowledge of my soul and of my natural wit lo the master monstruwacan sent once more the great voice of the home call abroad into the land and immediately besought those youths for the sake of their souls and the love which their mothers had for them to come swiftly homewards whilst they had yet this great power to shield them and allow them sweet sanity and i thought that some did look towards the pyramid as that they answered to the mighty voice of the home call and did read the message which the master monstruwacan made to them but in a moment they faced about seeming to have a good obedience to one who did always lead and of whom i had inquired and found to be one named aschoff who was a great athlete of the nine hundredth city and this same aschoff out of the boldness and bravery of his heart did make unwitting to destroy the souls of them all for he went forward and leapt into the billows of the bright shining fire that made a barrier in the way of their destruction and immediately the fire ceased from its shining and gave way and sank and grew to a nothingness and aschoff of the nine hundredth city began again to run towards the house of silence and all they that were with him did follow faithfully and ceased not to run and they came presently to the low hill whereon was that horrid house and they went up swiftly and they were two hundred and fifty and wholesome of heart and innocent save for a natural waywardness of spirit and they came to the great open doorway that hath been open since the beginning and through which the cold steadfast light and the inscrutable silence of evil hath made for ever a silence that may be felt in all the land and the great uncased windows gave out the silence and the light aye the utter silence of an unholy desolation and aschoff ran in through the great doorway of silence and they that followed and they nevermore came out or were seen by any human and it must be known that the mothers and the fathers of those youths looked out into the night land and saw that thing which came to pass and all the people were silent but some said presently that the youths would come forth again yet the people knew in their hearts that the young men had gone in to destruction for in truth there was that in the night which spoke horror to the souls of all and a sudden utter quiet in all the land but unto me that had the night hearing there came a great fear of that which might be whispered into my spirit out of the quietness of the night of the agony of those young men yet there came no sound to the hearing of the soul neither then nor in all the years that were to come for in verity had those youths passed into a silence of which the heart cannot think and here will i tell how that the strange quiet which did fill all the land seeming to brood within the night was horrid beyond all the roarings which had passed over the darkness in the time that went before so that it had given my spirit some rest and assurance to hear but the far echoing low thunder of the great laughter or the whining which was used at times to sound in the night from the south east where were the silver fire holes that opened before the thing that nods or the baying of the hounds or the roaring of the giants or any of those dreadful sounds that did often pass through the night for they could not have offended me as did that time of silence and so shall you judge how dreadful was that quiet which did hold so much of horror and surely it will be known that none had thinkings now even in idle speech that any should have power to succour the peoples of the lesser redoubt neither as i have said had any the knowledge of the place where it did stand and so was it made plain that those peoples must suffer and come unhelped and alone to their end which was a sad and dreadful thought to any yet had those within the great pyramid come already to much sorrow and calamity because that some had made attempt in this matter and there had been for gain only failure and the sorrow of mothers and the loneliness of wives and of kin and now this dread horror upon us which concerned those lost youths now as may be conceived this sure knowledge that we might give no succour to the people of the lesser redoubt weighed heavy upon my heart for i had maybe with foolishness held vague hopes and wonders concerning our power to make expedition secretly into the night to discover that lesser pyramid and rescue those poor thousands and above all as may be thought had i the thought of that sweet moment in which i should step forward out of the night and all mystery and terror and put forth mine arms to naani saying i am that one and knowing in my soul that she that had been mine in that bygone eternity should surely know me upon the instant and call out swiftly and come swiftly and be again unto me in that age even as she had been in this and to think upon it and to know that this thing should never be but that even in that moment of thought she that had been mine in these olden days of sweetness might be even then suffering horror in the power of some foul monster was like a kind of madness so that nearly i could seize the diskos and run forth unprepared into the evil and terror of the night land that i should make one attempt to come to that place where she abode or else to cast off my life in the attempt and oft did i call to naani and always i sent the master word beating through the night that she might have assurance that it was indeed i that did speak unto her spirit and no foul thing or monster spelling evil and lies unto her and oft did i make to instruct her that never should she be tempted forth from the shelter of that redoubt in which she did live by any message out of the night but always to await the master word and moreover to have a sure knowledge that none that was her friend would ever seek to entice her into the night and this way and that way would i speak with naani sending my words silently with my brain elements yet was it doleful and weariful and dreadful always to have speech into the dark and never to hear the answering beat of the master word and the sweet faint voice whispering within my soul yet once and again would i have knowledge that the aether did thrill about me weakly and to mine inward hearing it would seem that the master word did beat faintly in the night and thereafter would my heart have a little comfort in that i had assurance of a kind that the love maid of my memory dreams did still live and constant i put forth my soul to hark so that my health failed me with the effort of my harking and i would chide my being that i had not a wiser control and so make a fight to do sanely yet day by day did my heart grow more weary and restless for indeed it did seem that life was but a very little matter against so great a loss as my heart did feel to suffer and oft at this time and that did there come a voice speaking plainly out of the night and did purport to be the voice of naani but ever i did say the master word unto the voice and the voice had no power by which it could make the one answer yet i jeered not at the voice to show contempt of its failing to bewit me but let the matter bide and the voice would be silent a time and again would make a calling unto me but never did i make speech with it for therein lies the danger to the soul but always did speak the master word to its silencing and thereafter would shut the thing from my memory and think only upon sweet and holy matters as it might be truth and courage but more often of naani which was both sweet and holy to my spirit and heart and being and so it was as i have set down there were monsters without in the night that did torment me having it may be intent to lure me unto destruction or indeed it doth chance that they had no hope but to plague me with malice and as may be thought all this considering of my trouble and the giving of my strength unto naani through the night of the world that she might have comfort and help did work upon me so that i grew thin plainly to the eye of those that loved me and the master monstruwacan he that did love me as i were his son chid me gently and had wise speech with me so that i but loved him the more yet without having gain of health for my heart destroyed me as it doth if love be held back and made always to weep and it may be thought strange that my mother and my father did not talk also with me but i had neither mother nor father those many years and this thing i should have set down early so that none should waste thought pondering to no end but the blame is to my telling now concerning my love trouble there did happen a certain thing which gave me to decide for one night i waked from a sore troubled sleep and it did seem that naani did call my name mine olden love name and in a voice of utter anguish and with beseeching and i sat up in the bed and sent the master word into the night with my brain elements and presently all about me there was the solemn beat of the master word answering but weak and gone faint that scarce i might hear it and i called again with my brain elements unto naani that was mirdath and spoke to give her assurance and to haste to tell unto me that which was so wrong and pitiful with her and who shall be amazed that i was shaken with the eagerness of my spirit in that it was so long since naani had spoken clear within my soul and now behold her voice yet though i did call many a time unto the everlasting night there came no more the voice of naani speaking strangely within my spirit but only at times a weak thrilling of the aether about me and at the last i grew maddened with the sorrow of this thing and the sense and knowledge of harm about the maid and i stood upright upon my feet and i raised my hands and gave word and honour unto naani through all the blackness of the night that i would no more abide within the mighty pyramid to my safety whilst she that had been mine own through eternity came to horror and destruction by the beasts and evil powers of that dark world and i gave the word with my brain elements and bade her to be of heart for that until i died i would seek her but out of the darkness there came naught but the silence then i clothed me swiftly and went up quickly to the tower of observation that i might speak instant with the master monstruwacan for my heart burned in me to intention and to be doing speedily that which i had set upon myself to do and i came to the master monstruwacan and told all to him and how that i did mean no more to suffer in quiet and to no end but to make adventure into the night land that i find naani or perchance find a swift peace from this my long troubling now when the master monstruwacan heard that which i had to say it sat heavily upon him and he besought me long and many times that i refrain from this thing for that none might achieve so great a task but that i should be lost in my youth before many days were gone by yet to all his speech i said naught save that this thing was laid upon me and even as i had promised so should i make to act and in the ending the master monstruwacan perceived that i was set to this thing and not to be moved and he did put it to me how that i had grown to leanness with so much troubling and that i should have wisdom to wait awhile that i put on my full strength but even as i was so would i go and this i told to him gently and showed how that the thing was meet and helpful to the safety of my soul for that my strength was still in me yet was i sweeter in spirit because that i stood lean and pure and much poor dross and littleness had been burned from me so that fear was not in me and all do i lay to the count of my love which doth purify and make sweet and fearless the human heart and because i was even as i have said so was i the less in trouble of the forces of evil for long and sore had been my preparation of spirit and i wot that none had ever gone forth into the darkness so long withholden from that which doth weaken and taint the spirit and here let me set down how that the three days of preparation which were proper to those that willed to go forth into the night land had for their chief aim the cleansing of the spirit so that the powers of evil did have a less ableness to harm but also it was as i have said that none should go forth in ignorance of the full dreadfulness of all that held the night for it was at the preparation that there was made known certain horrors that were not told unto the young and of horrid mutilations and of abasements of the soul that did shake the heart with fear if but they were whispered into the hearing and these things were not set down in any book that might be lightly come by but were warded and safe locked by the master of the preparation in the room of preparation and indeed when i did hear that which presently i was to hear i had wonder in my heart that ever any went out into the night land or that ever the room of preparation should have other than students that meant not to go forth but only to achieve some knowledge of that which hath been done and mayhaps shall be once again yet in verity is this but the way of the human heart and hath always been and will be so in all the years for ever for to adventure is the lust of youth and to leave safety is the natural waywardness of the spirit and who shall reprove or regret for it were sorrowful that this spirit of man should cease yet must it not be thought that i do uphold fightings to the death or to mutilation between man and man but rather do sorrow upon this thought now when the morrow came if thus i shall speak of that which was outwardly even as the night though changing alway within the mighty pyramid i went unto the room of preparation and the door was closed upon me and i underwent the full preparation that i might have full power and aid to come to success through all the terror of the night land and three days and three nights did i abide within the room of preparation and upon the fourth day was mine armour brought unto me and the master of the preparation stood away from me silent and with sorrow upon his face but touching me not neither coming anigh to aid me nor having any speech with me for none might crowd upon me or cause me to answer and presently was i clad with the grey armour and below the armour a close knit suit of special shaping and texture to have the shape of the armour and that i might not die by the cold of the night land and i placed upon me a scrip of food and drink that might keep the life within me for a great time by reason of its preparation and this lay ready to me with the armour and was stitched about with the mark of honour so that i knew loving women thus to speed me and when all was done and made ready i took up the diskos and bowed in silence to the master of the preparation and he went towards the door and opened it and signalled that the people stand back so that i might go forth untouched and the people stood back for many had crowded to the door of the room of preparation so that i knew how that my story must be to the heart of all in all the cities of the great redoubt for to come unbidden anigh that door was against the lesser law and that any erred in this matter betokened much and i went out through the door and there was a mighty lane of people unto the great lift and about the great lift as i went downwards did the countless millions stand and all in a great silence but having dear sympathy in their souls yet loyal unto my safety in that none in all the mighty pyramid did make speech unto me or call out aught and as i went downward through the miles lo all the aether of the world seemed to be surged with the silent prayers and speedings of those quiet multitudes and i came at last unto the great gate and behold the dear master monstruwacan did stand in full armour and with the diskos to do me honour with the full watch as i went forth and i looked at him quietly and he looked unto me and i bent my head to show respect and he made silent salute with the diskos and afterwards i went onwards towards the great gateway and they made dim the lights in the great causeway that there should no glare go forth into the land when the gate was opened and behold they opened not the lesser gate within the greater for me but did honour my journey in that they swung wide the great gate itself through which a monstrous army might pass and there was an utter silence all about the gate and in the hushed light the two thousand that made the full watch held up each the diskos silently to make salute and humbly i held up the diskos reversed and went forward into the dark vi the way that i did go now i went forward for a space and took heed not to look backwards but to be strong of heart and spirit for that which did lie before me had need of all my manhood and courage of soul that i come to the succour of that maid afar in the darkness of the world or meet my death proper as it might need to be and thus did i go forward steadfastly and conscious in all my being of the emotions of that parting from my mighty home and of the tenderness and wiseness that did underlie so much curbed rule and guidance and my heart was warm towards the master monstruwacan for that great honour that he should come downward in armour to make one with the full watch that he might uphold me to a lofty spirit at the moment of my going and all that time as i went forward was the aether of the night about me in tumult with the thoughts and blind wishings of the great millions i had but now left to my back and presently as i steadied somewhat upon my emotions i was conscious of the exceeding coldness of the night air and of the different taste of it upon my lungs and in the mouth and it had as it were a wondrous keen sharping upon my palate and did fill the lips more in the breathing so that it may be supposed it had more body within it than that air which did fill the plateau of the thousandth city where was my home for the air of every city was of difference and the greater between one that was afar up and another nigh to the earth as may be thought so that many peoples did migrate unto that level which gave them best healthfulness but under rule and with a guidance of quantities and not all that were lacking of health for some are ever contrary and here let me set down that within the deeps of the fields there was air utter varied and wonderful that might charm one here and likewise sorrow another that were happier elsewhere so that all might have suiting did they but wander and have reason to companion them and thus did i go forward full of new thoughts and olden memories and fresh breaking wonders neither forgetting something of doubts and fears more than a little and again was it most cunning strange to be out there in the night land though not yet afar where often had my fancies and imaginings led me yet until that time never had i touched foot in all that life upon the outward earth and this must be a wondrous quaint seeming thought to those of this present day and so came i at last nigh to the circle that did go about the redoubt and presently i was come to it and something astonished was i that it had no great bigness for i had looked for this by reasoning having always a mind to picture things as they might be truly and hence coming sometimes to the wonder of a great truth but odd whiles to errors that others had not made and now lo i did find it but a small clear tube that had not two inches of thickness yet sent out a very bright and strong light so that it seemed greater to the eye did one but behold from a distance and this is but a little thing to set to the telling yet may it give something of the newness of all and moreover shall you have memory with me in this place how that oft had i seen things and beast monsters peer over that same little tube of light their faces coming forward out of the night and this had i seen as child and man for as children we did use to keep oft a watch by hours upon an holiday time through the great glasses of the embrasures and we did always hope each to be that one that should first discover a monster looking inwards upon the mighty pyramid across the shining of the circle and these to come oft yet presently to slink away into the night having in verity no liking for that light and pride had we taken of ourselves to perceive those monsters which had most of ugliness and horror to commend them for thereby did we stand to have won the game of watching until such time as a more fearsome brute be discovered and so went the play yet with ever it doth seem to me now something of a half known shudder to the heart and a child's rejoicing unknowingly in that safety which had power to make light the seeming of such matters and this also is but a small matter yet doth it bear upon the inwardness of my feelings for the memories of all my youth and of the many beasts that i had seen to peer across the light did come upwards in my mind in that moment so that i did give back a little unthinking of what i did but having upon me the sudden imagining of that which might come out of the dark beyond and i to stand a little moment and presently had grown free in my heart to have courage of farewell and so did turn me at last to the viewing of that wondrous home of the last millions of this world and the sight was an astonishment and an uplifting that indeed there was so mighty a thing in all the earth and well might be that there were monsters and forces gathered together about that hill of life out of all the darkness of the world for the thing was as a mighty mountain that went up measureless into the night and spread out upon the earth to the right and to the left of me so that it did seem to hold all the world with its might and in the nearer slope were there three hundred thousand great embrasures as well i did know there being in all the four sides of the redoubt twelve hundred thousand embrasures as was set out in the books of the schools and upon the cover of atlas books as they still quaintly to be called and many another place as might be supposed and half a mile upward was the lowest tier of those great window places and above that countless other tiers and a great light came out from them into the darkness so that i looked up into the night many miles and yet did see them in shining rows and did make separate each embrasure from its fellow for a great way but there grew yet more above in the mighty distance so that they were lost in the upward space of the night and did seem to me presently but as a constant glimmering fire that did shape a shining peak into the blackness of the heavens dwindling into the utmost height and thus was that everlasting monument then did it come to me that those little things which i did see to cluster against the embrasures were in truth the countless millions of the mighty redoubt and this i could make out with some plainness in those lower embrasures which were the more near to me than they above for the peoples were set against the light within yet were as small things like unto insects in that distance and within so huge a bulk and i knew that they looked out upon me and did watch through their spy glasses and i sent my gaze upwards again along that great slope of grey metal aye upward again to where it strode glimmering into the blackness and so at last to the little star that did crown that wonder of the world in the eternal night and for a little i did stare towards that far light for it came from within that tower of observation where so lately i had spended my life and i had knowledge within my heart that the dear master monstruwacan did bend the great spy glass upon me through which so oft had i spied and i raised the diskos unto him in salutation and farewell though i saw him not at all through that vast space and my heart was very full yet my soul but the stronger for it and then behold i was aware of a murmur in the night coming to me dim and from afar off and i saw the little shapes of the peoples in the lower embrasures in constant movement and i knew upon the instant that the multitudes did take that salute unto themselves and cried out and waved to me their farewells or to come back as may be and indeed i was but a lonesome person looking up at that great mountain of metal and life and i knew that i had danger to realise my plight and i stayed no more but did raise the diskos reversed as was but meet from one young man unto all the millions and i looked swiftly upward through those eight great miles of night unto that final light which did shine in the black heavens so that my friend should know that i thought of him that was beyond my sight in that last moment and it may be that the invisible millions that were far up in the night in the upper cities did take that also to be a meaning of farewell to themselves for there came down out of the monstrous height a far faint murmur of sound as of a vague wind up in the night then did i lower the diskos and turn me about and i breasted strangely against the air clog and stept forward across the circle into the lonesomeness of the night land and i looked no more behind for that which was my home did weaken my heart somewhat to behold so that i made determination that i look not again to my back for a great while yet about me as i went there was constant surging in the aether of the world and it did tell unto me how that those my people and kin had continual mind of me both in prayer and wishings and in a perpetual watching and the same gave to me a feeling as of being something companied yet in a time it came to me that this disturbance of the aether should tell to some evil force how that i was there abroad in the land but how to stop this thing who should have power for of truth had i been among them to make a full explaining of the danger they had been yet powerless to cease for but to have such great multitudes a think upon one matter was to set a disturbance about as should be most clear to all now at the beginning i did walk outwards into the night land somewhat blindly and without sure direction being intent only to put a good space to my back that i might cure somewhat the ache which did weaken my heart at the first but in awhile i ceased somewhat from my overswiftness and did put thought to my going and i came quickly to reason that i should try a new way through the land for it might be that there was an over watchfulness in that part which had been trod by the youths and i began therewith to set this thought to the practice and went not direct towards the north but to the north and west and so in the end to mean to circle around to the back of the north west watcher and thence to the north of the plain of blue fire and afterwards as might be have a true and straightway to the north and by this planning come a long way clear of that house of silence which did put more fear upon me than all else that was horrid in the land yet as all will see this made to me a greater journey though in verity it were better to go slowly and win to success than to make a greater haste towards destruction which was indeed surely to be mine end did i not go warily now it may be thought upon with wonder that i did go so assuredly to the north but i went thiswise part by an inward knowing and part come upon by much latter studying within the pyramid of olden books and by reasoning upon all things that i did observe that had seemings of verity in them and because of this constant searching upon one matter i had come but a while back upon a little book of metal very strange and ancient that had lain forgot in a hid place in the great library through ten hundred thousand years maybe or less or more for all that i had knowing and much that was writ in the book was common knowledge and set mostly to the count of fairy tales and suchlike even as we of this our age take not over surely any belief in myths of olden times yet had i always much liking for such matters perceiving behind that outer shell which did win always so much unbelief the kernel of ancient truths and happenings and thus was it concerning this little book which i had made discovery of for it told again that which oft i had heard even as we in this age read of the deluge how that once in a time monstrous far back from that but utter future to this age of ours the world did brake upwards in a vast earth quaking that did rend the world for a thousand miles and there came a mighty chasm so deep that none might see the bottom thereof and there rushed therein an ocean and the earth did burst afresh with a sound that did shake all the cities of the world and a great mist lay upon the earth for many days and there was a mighty rain and indeed this was just so set in certain histories of the ancient world also there was made reference to it within some olden records yet nowise to be taken with a serious mind to the seeming of the peoples of the mighty pyramid but only as a quaint study for the students and to be set out in little tales that did entertain the nurseries or as it might be wise men and the general yet there was this about that small and peculiar book that it did speak of many of these things as it were that it did quote from the pens of those that did have actual witness and set all out with a strange gravity that did cause one to consider it as meant to be indeed the tellings of truth and to seem thiswise to have great difference from all that i had read before concerning those matters and there was further a part in the ending of the book that did seem to be writ of a time that came afterwards maybe an hundred thousand and maybe a million years but who shall say and therein it did tell of an huge and mighty valley that did come out of the west towards the south east and made turning thence northwards and was a thousand miles both ways and the sides thereof were an hundred miles deep and the sun did stand in the western end and made a red gloom for a thousand miles and in the bottom there were great seas and beasts strange and awesome and very plentiful now this as may be seen was as the talk of romance yet did i turn my wits to their natural end and made thus plain of it for in truth i to have something of belief and it to seem to me that in a bygone eternity when the world was yet light as in my heart i knew to have been indeed a thing of verity there was a great and wondrous earthquake and the earthquake did burst the world up along a certain great curve where it had weakness and there fell into the yawning furnace of the world one of the great oceans and immediately made of itself steam and so brake upwards again and tore the earth mightily in its swift uprising and thereafter there was a mist and confusion and rain upon the world and indeed all very seemly put and not to be taken as a light tale then in that ending of the book there was one that did write having lived in a vast later age when the sun had come anigh to his dying and the upward earth was grown quiet and cold and not good to live upon and in that time the mighty chasm had been calmed by the weight of an eternity so that it was now a most deep and wondrous valley that did hold seas and great hills and mountains and in it were great forests of kinds and lands that were good and healthful and places given over to fire and to steamings and sulphur clouds so that they held poisons that had ill for man and great beasts were there down in that far depth that none might see ever save by a strong spy glass and such there were in the early world and had now been bred in the ending by those inward forces of nature which did make the valley a place of good warmth so that there was as it were once more the primal world born to give new birth unto such olden monsters and to others new and peculiar to that age and circumstance and all this indeed did the book give also but constrained and difficult to take clearly to the heart and not like to the wise plain speech of the early tellings so that i must even set it out here in mine own speech and it did seem to me by my reading that man had come at one time to a great softness of heart and spirit through many ages of over ease but that the world did come to coldness and unfriendliness by reason of the sun's slow ceasing and there was presently in naturalness a race upon the earth that were hardy and made to fight for their lives and did perceive that the mighty valley that cut the world in twain was a place of warmth and life and so did make to adventure their bodies down that wondrous height and were many ages coming safe to the bottom but did find safe places in the downward way where they built them houses and made to live and begot them children and these grew up to that life of constant and great climbings and of hard workings upon the road which was the one intent of that people so that the book did speak of them always as the road makers and thus did they make downwards through the long years and the ages and many generations did live and die and saw not the reaching of the road down into that great vale that lay so monstrous deep in the world but in the end they did come there with the road and they were very hardy and they did fight with the monsters and slay many and they built them many cities through great years in the mighty valley and did make the road from city unto city along that great valley even unto the bight of the valley and they found here a constant darkness and shadow for that the sun could not make a shining around that great corner yet even here they ceased not to make the road but took it around and a mighty way unto the north passing it among strange fires and pits that burned from out of the earth but there was presently such a power and horror of monsters and evil things in that valley of shadow that the road makers were made to go backwards into the red light which did fill the westward valley and came from that low sun and they went back unto their cities and lived there mayhaps an hundred thousand years and grew wise and cunning in all matters and their wise people did make dealings and had experiment with those forces which are distasteful and harmful unto life but they did this in ignorance for all that they had much wisdom thinking only to experiment that they come to greater knowings but they did open a way for those forces and much harm and pity did come thereby and then had all people to have regret yet too late now presently when an hundred thousand years had gone or it may be a greater space there came slowly the utter twilight of the world as the sun to die the more so that presently it gave but an utter gloomy light and there grew upon many of the peoples of the cities of the valley a strangeness and a wildness so that strange things were done that had been shameful to all in the light and there were wanderings and consortings with strange outward beings and presently many cities were attacked by monsters that did come from the west and there was a pandemonium then was an age of sorrows and fightings and hardenings of the spirit and of the heart for all that were of good fibre and this did breed a determined generation and there grew up into the world a leader and he took all the sound millions and did make a mighty battle upon all foulness and upon all that did harm and trouble them and they drove their enemies down the valley and up the valley and did utterly scatter and put them to flight then did that man call all his peoples together and did make it plain how that the darkness grew upon the world and that the foul and dreadful powers abroad were like to be more horrid when a greater gloom came and he put to them that they build a mighty refuge and the peoples did acclaim and lo there was built presently a great house but the great house was not proper and that man did take all the peoples to wander and they came to the bight and there was built at last that great and mighty pyramid now this is the sense and telling of that book and but late had i read it and talked somewhat of it with my dear friend the master monstruwacan but not overmuch for i had taken so sudden a mind to go that all else had dropped from about me yet to us it did seem clear that there was no life in all the invisible upper world and that surely that great road whereon the silent ones did walk must be that same road which the hardy peoples of that age did make and it did seem wise to the master monstruwacan and unto me that if any should find the lesser redoubt they must surely do so somewhere within the mighty valley but whether the road that led into the west where was the place of the ab humans should bring me to it i had no knowing nor whether it might lie on the northward way and i maybe to wander a thousand miles wrong if in truth i were not into some dreadful trouble before and indeed no reason of value was there to give me hope that the lesser pyramid lay either to the west or where the road went north ward beyond the house of silence yet i did so feel it to be somewhere to the north that i had made a determination to search that way for a great distance the first and if i could not come upon aught then i should have sober thought that it did lie westward but in the valley someways i had feeling of assurance that it must be for it was plain that the telling of the book was sound in its bottom sense as might be seen for how should any live in the utter bleak and deadly chill of the silent upper world that lay an hundred miles up in the night hid and lost for ever and strange is it to think of those wondrous and mighty cliffs that girt us about and yet were fast held from us in the dark so that i had not known of them save for the telling of that book though in truth it had been always supposed that we lived in a great deep of the world but indeed it was rather held in belief that we abode in the bed of some ancient sea that did surely slope gradual away from us and not go up abrupt and savage and here let me make so clear as i may that the general peoples had no clear thought upon any such matters though there was something of it taught in the schools yet rather this and that of diverse conclusions as it might be thinkings of the teachers after much study and some ponderings for one man having a lack of imagining would scoff and another maybe to take it very staidly but some would build fancy upon the tellings of the records and make foolish and fantastic that which had groundings in truth and thus is it ever but to the most peoples of the pyramid there was no deep conviction nor thought of any great hid world afar in the darkness for they gave attention and belief only to that which lay to their view nor could a great lot come to imagine that there had been ever any other condition and to them it did seem right and meet that there should be strange things and fires from the earth and an ever abiding night and monsters and matters hid and tangled much in mystery and very content were the most of them though some had in them the yeast of imaginings or the pimples of fancy upon them and to these there seemed many possibilities though the first to read out to sanity and the second to expect and have speech towards much that was foolish or to no purpose and of these vague believings of the peoples have i made hint before and need not have much trouble to it now save that with the children as is ever the way those olden tales had much believing and the simplicity of the wise did mate with the beliefs of the young and between them did lie the truth and so did i make speed towards the north having a strong surety in my heart and mind that there were but two ways to my search for without of the valley afar up in the dead lonesomeness of the hidden world was a cold that was shapen ready to death and a lacking as i must believe of the sweet needful air that yet did lie in plenty in that deep place of the earth so that surely the mighty valley somewheres to hold that other redoubt yet as i have said i went not direct to my journey but otherwise for those sound reasons which i did set down a time back vii the night land now as i went towards the north and west i steered me warily for a great while that i come safe of that great watcher of the north west and as i made forward i put thought to all matters which must concern me so far as i had imagining to see and first i did consider the speed that i should keep and found presently that i did well to be moderate for that i had before me a great and mighty journey and indeed who might speak knowingly of the end thereof and another matter i did arrange for i would make the times of my goings forward and the times of mine eatings and sleepings all to a wise and regular fashion that thereby i might go a great way with the less harm to my body so that i should be strong when the need did come for my strength and i made in the end that i should eat and drink at every sixth hour and at the eighteenth hour sleep me until the twenty fourth and by this means did i eat thrice in that time and have six hours of sleep and this seemed very good to me and i did strive always to manage thus in all my great journeying in the night land yet as may be supposed there were times oft and many when i must watch without ceasing and leave my slumber unto the future for the land was full of grim and dreadful perils and as doth be human i brake my rule straightway in the beginning for i ceased not to walk for one and twenty hours hiding and creeping as the need did be in those places that were like to show me unto the watcher and when i did think upon food it did sicken me so that i would eat by and by as i made it within my thoughts but when one and twenty hours had gone i grew very weary and something faint and was forced that i look about for some place where i might have rest and in a little while i did see away off a small fire hole the like of which i had passed odd times even so early and i made to come nigh to that part for there would be warmth from the chill of the night land and mayhaps a place dry and convenient to my slumber and when i came anigh i saw that it was a cheerful place as it might be said amid so much gloom for the hole was but a few paces wide and full of a dull glowing fire that did bubble somewhat and throw off a small sulphur smoke and i sat me down at no great way and did place the diskos on the rock to my hand and i moved not awhile but was aweary so that i had not the courage to eat neither to drink but must turn me and look back to the mighty pyramid and in truth though i had come a very good space yet was i so anigh to it that i was both cheered and put out of heart for it did seem close upon me by reason of its greatness so that i who had journeyed a hard and weariful way was shaken with the greatness of the task that was upon me yet was this but one side of my heart for it was good to feel the nearness of my mighty home and i knew that there did countless millions make watch upon me as i sat yet did i make no sign for it is not meet to make a constant farewell but to go yet was it very strange to be thus near and to show such behaviour as were proper to one afar from all humanity but so it was that i ordered my ways for it did seem proper to me yet was i happy to know that the dear master monstruwacan must time and oft have spied upon me through the great spy glass and mayhaps did watch me in that moment and it grew in me that i did act weakly to hold off from mine vittles and showed foolishness before my kind friend afar and i did ope my scrip and take therefrom three tablets the which i chewed and did eat for this was a strong food treated that it had but small bulk yet were they not filling to the belly and i made that i would drink well that i might feel that something was therein and to this end i shook from a strong and especial tube a dust and i caught the dust within a little cup and the air did make an action upon that dust as it were of chemistry and the dust did boil and make a fizzing in the cup and rose up and filled it with a liquid that was of simple water yet very strange to see come that way but ordinary after a time and in this way as might be seen had i such food and drink in but a little scrip that might keep life within me for a great time yet was it a way of discomfort and lacking to the mouth and to the belly but a sufficient thing unto the need of the body and good matter for a thankful heart in that dark and hungry land now when i had eaten i did go over in their order those things which i did carry for there was beside the diskos and that scrip of food a pouch that did contain matters various and these i did look into and afterward did take out a small compass that i had been give by the master monstruwacan so that i might find of its workings without the great redoubt and he had said unto me that it might be that i should pass far off into the night land and lose the mighty pyramid amid so great a country and so plentiful a darkness then perchance if that ancient principle did still lurk within the machine though turned no more to the north but unto the pyramid then should it guide my feet homeward out of the everlasting night and thus have once more that ancient use which as i do know is common unto this age and this was a very cunning thing to have with me if but it held service to the earth current and a rare thing which the master monstruwacan did make with his own hands and much skill and pains from an olden one that had place within the great museum and concerning which i have told somewhat before this place and i set the thing upon the ground but it had no certain way with it but did spin and waver constantly and this i made to consider and remembered that i was yet above that part where afar in the earth did spread the greatness of the underground fields and i was haply but a little way off from the crack though a mighty way above and it pleasured me to wonder whether the dear master monstruwacan did behold how that i made test with the compass for the light was good from the fire hole and the great spy glass had a great strength yet had i no certainty for as i did know from much watchings there was no surety in the searching of the land by the glass for there was oft plainness where you did think surely none should see and anon a dullness where might be thought that the sight went gaily and this may be plain to all for the wavering of the lights from the strange fires was not to be accounted to rule but made a light here and a darkness there and then did change about oddly moreover there were smokes and mists that did come upwards from the earth in this place and in that and had somewhiles a greatness but oft were small and did lurk low and had no power but to confuse the sight and presently i did put by the compass in my pouch and made to compose myself unto sleep but here would i now set down how that in the end after i had gone many days' journeyings outward from the mighty pyramid i did indeed find it to draw the northward part of the needle unto it and this was a comfort and a pleasure to my spirit moreover if ever i did get back as i did think it would be a matter for great interest unto the master monstruwacan yet in verity were there other matters that should hold him more for he was right human as all should know and moreover concerning this same compass i did find a fresh thing for after a yet greater time as i shall set out in a due place if i do but remember which doubt is ever my fear to fret me i came a mighty way from the redoubt and lo fearing that i might indeed lose that my great home in the darkness of the world i did pull out that strange wonder of the needle that i might have comfort by its homeward pointing and i did discover a new power in the night for the machine did point no more directwards unto the great redoubt but was a point unto the westwards so that i had knowledge that some great power afar in the darkness of the world did sway upon it and i had a childlike wonder that this might be in truth that same power of the north of which the books and my memory dreams did tell and indeed no doubt should there be upon this matter yet who might not have doubt in that time that they should perceive after an eternity that ancient northward force swaying that small servant unto an olden obedience and it was as it were a revealing unto me how that to know within the brain is one matter but to have knowledge within the heart is another for i had always known concerning this northward force but yet had not known with the true meaning of knowledge and yet one other matter there was to cause doubt at that moment of this new knowing for it came to me that maybe the power of that lesser redoubt did begin to act upon the machine even as the earth current of the great pyramid did hold yet a strong drawing upon the needle and were this so then did i not surely begin to stand anigh unto my journey's end for that less power of the lesser redoubt could have no impudence to pull save that i had come to a closeness with it yet in truth as i do now have knowledge it was the north that drew and i do seem to make a great telling about this little matter but how else shall i show to you mine inward mind and the lack of knowledge and likewise the peculiar knowings that did go to the making of that time and the peoples thereof which is but to say the same thing twice over and now as i did say i made to compose myself for sleep and to this end i took a cloak matter which did cross my shoulder and hip and wrapt it about me and lay down there in the darkness of the night by that strange fire hole and i lay the diskos beside me within the cloak for it was indeed my companion and friend in bitter need so that i had pleasure to feel the strange thing anigh to me and as i did lie there in those moments that do drowse the soul as it were that they do proceed as breath out of the mouth of sleep i had a half knowing that the aether did surge about me and i doubt not but that there had watched my every doing many of the millions and had been humanly stirred at my commending of my spirit unto sleep and thus did shake the aether of the world about me with their unity of sympathy and mayhaps i had some little knowing of this thing as i did pass drowsy into slumber and it is surely like that i slept the better for it moreover i was wondrous tired and worn and thus did sleep very strong and heavy yet i mind me that my last dim thinkings were upon that sweet maid i did go to find and in slumber did i have speech with her in dreams and a strange happiness about me and all seeming to be touched by fairy light and freed from the sorrow of life and it was from a sweet and lovely sleeping such as this that i was waked suddenly by a great and mighty sound and i came instant to a possessing of my senses and i knew that the mighty voice of the home call did go howling across the night and swift and silent i slid the cloak from about me and took the haft of that wondrous diskos into mine hand and i did look towards the pyramid quickly for a message for i had a sure knowledge that there had a great need arisen and that some terror came towards me out of the dark else they had never waked all the night land to a knowing that an human was abroad out of the mighty refuge and even as i did peer towards the great redoubt i could not abide to keep my gaze entire that way but did take a large and fearful look all about me yet could make to see nothing and so did stare eager and anxious afar into the upper blackness of the night where did shine that final light of the tower of observation and the same while crouched and holding the diskos and making to glance across my shoulders and to watch for the message and all in the same moment and then afar upwards in the prodigious height i did see the great and bright and quick darting flashes of a strange green fire and did know that they spelled to me in the set speech a swift warning that a grey monster that was a great grey man had made scent of me in the dark and was even in that moment of time crawling towards me through the low moss bushes that lay off beyond the fire hole to my back and the message was sharp and bade me to leap into the bushes unto my left and to hide there so that i might chance to take the thing to an advantage and as may be thought they had scarce flashed the tale unto me but i was gone in among the shadows of a clump of the moss bush that did grow anigh and i sweat with a strange terror and a cold and excited shaking of the heart yet was my spirit set strong to conquer and lo as i did crouch there hidden i saw something come very quiet out of the bushes that did grow beyond the fire hole and it was great and crept and was noways coloured but by greyness in all its parts and the glare from the fire hole did seem to trouble it so that it looked laying its head to the ground and spying along the earth in a strange and brutish fashion that it might oversee the glare of the fire hole yet i doubt that it saw beyond the fire with plainness for in a moment it crept swift in among the bushes again and came out towards the edge of the fire hole in another place and this it did thrice unto my left and thrice unto my right and every time did lay its head to the earth and spy along and did hunch its shoulders and thrust forward the jaw horridly and turn the neck as a very nasty beast might go wanton now as you may think this manner of the beast man did shake my courage mightily for i did think each time that it did go inward among the moss bushes that it had made discovery of me and would make to take me in the back from out of the dark of the bushes and this was an uncomfortable thing to consider as others might think also had any been there in the bush with me and then in truth did that same swift sense of mine hearing prove helpful to my saving for behold the thing did go back into the moss bushes after that last coming out and did seem to make as it had made a failing to discover me and had no further intent save to return unto the night and i had this thought truly in mine heart and for maybe a minute and then lo within my soul a voice did speak plain and did warn me that the thing did make a great compass among the moss bushes about the fire hole having made discovery of me and it did go warily to take me in the back from the other side now when i heard this voice speak within my spirit i had knowledge that the dear master monstruwacan made watch from the tower of observation and did send the speech with his brain elements having in mind that i had the night hearing and i trusted the speech for in the same moment of time there did beat all about me in the night the solemn throb of the master word as that it had been added with speed to give instant assurance and i leapt quick from that clump of the moss bush unto another and crouched and made a watch all about me and kept the ears of my spirit open knowing that the master monstruwacan did also watch all for me and suddenly i saw a little moving of a bush that grew to the back of those bushes in which i had been hid and there came out of the bush that moved a great grey hand and moved the moss of the clump where i had been as it were that something peered out of the moving bush and there followed the great grey head of the grey man and the head went into the clump of the moss bush where i had been and i knew that i must strike now and i leapt and smote with the diskos and the thing fell upon its side and the great grey legs came out of the hither bushes and twitched and drew upwards but the head remained in the bush where i had been hid and i stood away from the thing whilst it died and in mine hand the diskos did spin and send forth fire as it were that it did live and did know that it had slain a great and horrid monster and presently the grey man was dead and i went away from those bushes unto the far side of the fire hole and i stood with the diskos held high and spinning and sending out fire that they within the mighty pyramid might know that i had slain the beast man for it might be that it lay too much in the shadow for them to look upon but the master monstruwacan spoke not again to me for indeed it was not meet to do so except it might save me from a sure danger for as you may know from my past tellings there were powers of the night land that did hearken unto such matters and it was like enough that there had been overmuch done even thus for my further safety yet the thing could not be helped and now that i was a little calmed and eased from my fear i could know that all that the aether of the night was disturbed by the gladness of the millions within the great redoubt so that it was plain how great a multitude had given note unto the fight and their hearts to beat in sweet sympathy and natural fear so that i did feel companied and befriended though as it may be thought something shaken yet about the heart now in a little time i did gather unto me my wits and had myself to order and i looked to see how the hours did go and i found that i had surely slumbered through ten hours and i reproached myself for indeed i had slept oversound by reason of my having lacked a regular way and time as i had with a proper wisdom made to be my rule and i resolved that i would obey the wit of my reason in all the future time and make to eat and rest in due season as you will wot that i did before intend then with a self reproachful heart i went around the small fire hole and caught up my cloak and other matters and i turned me towards the mighty pyramid and did look once upwards along all the great slope where it did go measureless into the far blackness of the everlasting night and i made no salutation for i had so resolved as you will know moreover i desired not to call forth any unneedful disturbance of the aether of the world which indeed must be did i make to stir the emotions of the millions and i turned me then away and went off into the night going swift and cautious and bearing the diskos cunningly and almost as it were with a love for that strange and wondrous weapon that had so befriended me and slain the foul grey man with one stroke and i had feeling that it did know me and had a comradeship for me and i doubt none will understand this save it might be they of the olden days that did carry one strong sword always yet was the diskos more than the sword for it did in truth seem to live with the fire and the flame of the earth current that did beat within it and it was well acknowledged within the great redoubt that none might touch the diskos of another for that the thing went crustily as it might be said in the hands of a stranger and if any made foolishness of this knowledge and did persist much to such an handling or making to use the same would presently act clumsy with the weapon and come to an hurt and this was a sure thing and had been known maybe an hundred thousand years or perchance a greater time and by this it doth seem wise to believe that there did grow always an affinity between the nature of the man which doth as ever include the woman and the diskos that he did use in his practice and because of this known thing and that the place would elsewise be lumbered with olden weapons of those that did die it was a law and usage that there was placed with the dead the diskos of the dead there upon the last road in the country of silence and was thus made to give back unto the earth current the power that did lie in it and this doth seem to a careless thinker as it were that i told once again those olden customs of the ancient folk but this is otherwise and had a sound reason to it yet if you do so believe i doubt not but that a right human sentiment was something at the bottom which is proper for it is meet that love should mate with wisdom to mother comfort in our sorrows and it is a warm thing to do aught for our dead and none may say nay to this now as i did go onwards into the night land looking ever to this shadow and to that it may be conceived how my heart would stir with swift fear at this and that and that my body would oft quiver to leap aside and as swift discover that naught assailed and so did i go forward and always with imaginings and wonders concerning what manner of uncouth being or brute might come out of the darknesses all about yet in all that time there was a certain proudness of the heart that i did come safe out of the power of the grey man and did surely slay him but truly it were well that the praise be considered and not overmuch given unto me for i had died as i slept but that they of the great redoubt had made a watch over me and waked me unto my saving now presently as i walked i grew something faint and had knowledge that i did foolishly for indeed i should have eat after my fight yet may i be forgiven for this forgetting in that i had been much shaked and put about and i sat me down in a little clear place among the bushes and did eat three of the tablets and did once more shake forth the dust that did turn in the air to a natural water by a proper and natural chemistry of these matters and after i had eat i sat a little while and did think and did look upwards at the great slope of the pyramid in the night and all the time did i listen with mine ears and with my spirit and kept the diskos across my knees and looked this way and that very frequent but nothing came anigh and so i rose presently and went onwards and walked for six hours towards the north and the west and i made much to the west for a little that i might come clear of the north west watcher yet after a space i made to do foolishly for i changed my mind about and kept something more towards the north so that i should have a surer sight of that monster and this was in truth a rash and naughty thing to consider for if i were but seen then should that grim brute make a signal unto the evil powers and i be met swiftly with destruction but surely the heart is a strange and wayward thing and given to quick fears and immediately unto great and uncountable rashnesses and so i did go forward unwisely to the northward of a safe and proper going and it may be that an influence was upon me and drew me thatwards but who shall say now a great time i walked and made a halt upon every sixth hour and did eat and drink and look a little unto the monstrous towering of the great redoubt and afterwards make strong mine heart and go forward again and always i did go warily and chiefly among the low moss bush but sometimes out upon stony ground and oft across places where sulphur did puff somewhat from the ground in a low smoke very strong in the nostrils and not liked inwardly and as i made onwards i looked always to my right and to my left and anon to the rear yet made a constant observation of the mighty watcher that i did begin to draw nigh unto and oft did i stoop to crawl and my hands did bleed somewhat but after i was troubled so i put on the great gloves that made complete the grey armour and so was shod proper to such journeying and presently when eighteen hours did have passed since that my sudden awakening to the peril of the grey man i did search about for a place to slumber for i would keep wisely unto my ruling and go not over long lacking of sleep and by this planning i should be the less like to sleep oversound and so should set my spirit to listen whilst i did sleep and by so much as my spirit should serve me with faith should i have safety and this thing is plain and wants not more to the saying thereof and i came presently unto a sudden place where the land did go downwards brokenly as that it had been burst a great while gone by the inward fires and i looked downwards over the edge of that place and went round about it and did see presently a ledge upon the far side that was difficult to come upon yet a place of some little safety to any that might go down to it for it was awkward to see and did any monster seek to come at me i should have chance of warning and might go downwards a greater way in time to my salvation and by this determination i abode and came down to that place with labour but was cheerful of heart that i had found so sure a shelter and i eat my three tablets and drank the water that i did get from the powder and so made to compose my body to sleep yet at this time a thought did come to me and i made calculation afresh and laughed somewhat at that my poor counting for indeed i had thought to eat but thrice in the twenty and four hours yet by my arranging i was made indeed to eat four times as you shall see immediately by a little thought and this thing came more strong upon my spirit than any might think for i did eat overmuch for the lasting of the food though in verity it was but little to my belly as you must all think and have sympathy for my discomfort and i considered a little and had determined that i should afterwards in my journeying eat but two of the tablets to my meal and this was a wise thought and like much wisdom a discomposing thing but so it was and i set it down that you may know the arranging of my ways at that time now in all this while of meditation i had been setting my cloak about me and was fast set to my sleeping for i had walked a weary way and i lay me down upon my left side with my back to the rock which did overhang me something above so that i was contented to feel hid from things that might pass by in the night and i had the cloak about me and the diskos close against my breast within the cloak and my head upon my pouch and upon my scrip and as i lay thus a moment easeful i could see that so mighty was the uprising of the great pyramid that it was not hid from me even thus but did stand upward into the night and did shine and was plain to be seen above the further edge of that deep place where i did lie and i fell upon sleep looking upward at that final light where as might be the master monstruwacan did bend the great spy glass upon my lonesomeness as i lay there upon the ledge and this was a thought of sweet comfort upon which to slumber the which i did but my spirit lay wakeful within my breast and did listen through the night and harked for all evil matters and things that did make to come anigh but also my spirit did whisper unto naani as i went into sleep and so passed i into dreams now it may be thought that i did act with a strange valiance in that i composed my body so properly to slumber and with but a little trouble of the heart concerning the coming of monsters and in truth this hath seemed somewhat so to me thinking since that time but i do but set the thing that is truth and make not to labour to an illusion of truth and so must tell much that doth seem improper to the reality yet must all bear with me and have understanding of the hardness of setting forth with true seeming the honesty of truth which in verity is better served oft times by timely and cunning lies and so shall you understand this matter so well as i and presently my spirit waked me there in the half dark of the night land and i looked swift about me and upwards and saw nothing to fear then did i peer at my dial and made to discover that i had slept full over six quiet hours and by this i knew the reason of mine awaking for it was so great impressed upon me by mine inward sense and being and this you shall understand someways who have thought ere sleep to wake to a certain time of the morning and by understanding shall you believe and give me all your kind harking and human sympathy and i made to have a smartness of going which is ever hard to the newly waked and i eat two tablets the while my belly did cry out for an wholesome and proper filling but i drank some of the water and so did ease somewhat of my hunger then did i wind my cloak to its shape and put upon me my gear which was the scrip and the pouch and the diskos to my hip and i clomb out from that place of rest yet before i did come rightly up into the open i peered about and made some surety that no evil brute was anigh and then i gat me out and stood upon my feet and looked for a little upwards at the mighty slope of the great redoubt which did seem yet very nigh unto me by reason of it being so monstrous in bigness and i wondered whether in that moment the master monstruwacan did look down upon me with the great spy glass and afterwards i turned away swiftly and went on into the night land for it did always make me shaken with lonesomeness to look upon my great home and so i did go forward with a strong and uncaring stride but grew presently to quietness and to have back the proper caution of my going yet had i not gone all foolishly for i had taken the diskos from my hip ere this so that i possessed it handily now there is one matter which shall seem but a small and natural occurring unto you yet was strong upon me in that time and this thing was that i did begin now to see the night land from the new outlooking of my distance from the mighty pyramid and it was as that a man of this day did go from the earth to travel among the stars and lo should he not find them to shift upon his vision so that the great bear and this and that shaping of the star clusterings should make a new order as he did wander onwards and so should he find that there was naught that was truly fixed as he did before then think but all to alter according unto the place whence the looking and this thing shall be plain unto you though no thought be put to the matter for it is of an evident verity that doth need not argument to expound and so shall you have memory of me there a wander among those strange shapings and wonders of that grim land the which i had never but supposed to seem but as my memory did retain them from the lookings of all my life within the great redoubt and so it was and ever there did this thing and that open out to a new view and the night land take to itself a constant new aspect to mine eyes which had never until that time had but the one fixed vision of the same and you shall understand with me how that when about the fourteenth hour of that day's travel i did draw very nigh unto the monstrous watcher of the north west it did seem so utter strange from this fresh aspect that i had been like to think that i did see a new monster for in truth when i did come at last to creep to within a mile of it among the low moss bushes i was confounded that the mighty chin did come forward towards the great redoubt even as the upward part of a vast cliff which the sea doth make hollow about the bottom for it did hang out into the air above the glare of the fire from the red pit as it had been a thing of rock all scored and be weathered and dull red and seeming burned and blasted by reason of the bloody shine that beat upward from the deep of the red pit and by the way in which i do tell upon it you shall know that i did surely view it something from the side at this immediate time for in truth it was then that i did draw the nearer and moreover i was the more astonished at this viewing than i had been to the front for it was so utter strange and shapen so different from the brute that did hang in my memory and a great time i did lie there upon my belly and shaken by a fear of the beast yet emboldened as you may conceive by having come to the side and being hopeful in my heart that i was very secure within so great a shadow and the thick sheltering of the moss bushes and surely it was that i did creep more nigh the while that i did look for presently i had a very plain seeing of the great monster and did know where i had gotten to and thereby did acknowledge unto myself that this was an utter foolishness and like for all that any might say to lead unto destruction yet as all must know there was the first fear and the ceasing of this fear as i did wot that i was so little a thing to heed out there in the shadows and presently a gaining of courage and the prick of my being that did crave to see clear this exceeding wonder and so was i come close more or less having gone far upon my hands and knees yet sometimes to pause but afterwards on again now by this nearness i was the more truly able to perceive how that the bulk of the watcher did rise up into the night like a hill and the colour was mostly black save and indeed where it did face to the red shine of the pit and concerning this i have done telling and so did i lie there and stare a great while parting a small hole in the moss bushes that i might spy through the same and the thing was squat there and might have root within the earth so it did seem to mine imaginings as i did stare with a dumb wonder and there were monstrous warts upon the thing and indents and a mighty ruggedness and lumpings as it were that it did be pimpled with great boulders that were inbred within that monstrous hide and where the shine from the pit of red fire did strike upon these they did stand out into the darkness away from the skin as you of this age shall see mountains of the moon catch a bright fire from the sun and show plain upon the night of the moon now as i have set down i did lie there and look a great while and it came presently to me that there was unease within the mighty pyramid among the millions for i did feel the aether of the world to be disturbed by their distress and so had a knowing that they had a cunning wareness concerning the place where i did hide among the moss bushes and the thrilling in the night did bring a wisdom into my head for in verity as i have said this was a foolish matter that i was upon and i gat a thought that the watcher might have an awaredness of the trouble of the multitudes and indeed for all that i did know it had a full knowledge of all my wandering though concerning this i did think otherwise truly in my heart as is a most human and proper way to make comfortable the spirit where doubt can have no ease from reason and i made that i would go backwards to a good distance from the watcher and go forward again upon my journeying if but that i come safe from so unwise an adventuring and as i did begin to return it was to me as that all my senses were newly awake for i had a sudden knowing that i was within the atmosphere should i not call it of the monster and i gat an abrupt and horrid shaking of the spirit for i did feel in verity that my soul had come too anigh and that the beast had a sure knowledge concerning me yet did make to my destruction with no haste but after that way and fashion that did seem proper unto it and this feeling you shall understand the better maybe when i do tell that it was to me as that the air all about me was full of a quiet and steadfast life and keen intelligence that i did believe to come forth from the watcher on every side so that i did feel as one already within the gaze of some great and evil power yet though i had a great terror upon me i made no foolish haste but commanded my soul to courage and put a guard upon my way of going and so made a very quiet journey for maybe two full miles and afterwards did allow myself something more of haste for i was now grown easier in my spirit and felt apart from the spirit of the great watcher and after a longer while i did leave that hill of watchfulness to my rear and was gone onward into the night yet as may be known with a vague unease and trouble to my heart and a swift and frequent turning to learn surely that no evil thing came after me for as you may know i could nowise have forgetting concerning that great quiet life which did seem to be living in all the air around that mighty bulk for it had been all about me in the night as i have told and i to feel that i had been surely discovered and thus shall you know how shaken was my spirit in verity now presently at the eighteenth hour of that day's travel i ceased from my journeying that i might eat and drink and i did sit a little while and looked back upon the strange and monstrous thing which i had come beyond and the great humped back and vast shoulders of the watching thing rose up into the night black and cumbrous against the red shine of the pit and thus as you shall think had that brute looked always unto the mighty pyramid through eternity and did cease not from watching and was steadfast and silent and alone and none did understand and after i had eat and drunk some of the water i went onward for a full matter of six hours more being minded to have no sleep until i had put a great way between me and the watcher and in this part of my journey did i come to the place where the silent ones kill as it was named in the maps and i observed a very wondrous caution and went away from it a little unto the north where i did see at a distance the shinings of fire holes the which did promise me warmth through my slumber and here you must know that the place where the silent ones kill was an utter bare place where all did seem of rock and no bush did seem to grow thereon so that a man might not come to any hiding though in truth there might be some hole here or there yet was none shown in any map within the pyramid neither did there seem to be any such to me as i did creep there among the moss bushes to the northward of the place and look constant and fearful towards it so that i should see quickly whether any silent one did move across all the grey quiet of that rocky plain and concerning this same place where the silent ones kill it were well to make an explanation how that there was always a little and far spreaded light over all that lonesomeness and the light was something grey seeming as it were that a lichen might grow upon the rocks and send out a little uncomfortable glowing even as certain matters do in these times if you do but know the place and the time to seek them yet was the light exceeding weak and very cold and dismal and did seem truly to show naught with a sureness so that it did appear to the eye if one did look fixedly that there were shadows that did move here or there as it were of silent beings and none might know in truth whether this shaping of the greyness was to the clouding of the reason or that the eye did see of reality yet if one did look with the great spy glass then might there be some surety and plainness and likewise was it so if one did have come sufficient anigh to that uncomfortable place even as i then did be and so you shall conceive how that i did slide very quiet from bush unto bush for i had alway in all my life had a very dread fear of this place and oft did i peer out into the dim grey light of the lonesome plain unto my left and would think sometimes to perceive the shapes of the silent ones stood vague and watchful yet on the instant to see nothing and thus i did go onward and came presently to a part where the grey plain did stretch out a bareness into the night land to my front so that my way ended unless i did make a long passing round about and i sat there among the moss bushes and did consider and lookt out cunningly through a spy hole of the bush in which i did sit and i perceived that the part of the plain which did jut bareness into the land before me had no greatness of size but might be passed swiftly in but a little running and this thing should save me a wearisome going round so that i made to consider it with a serious mind and all the time did i search the bare greyness before me and saw presently that it was surely empty and i made to adventure myself across running very swift until i had come to the far side and lo as i did go to rise up out of the bush mine eyes were opened as it were and i saw that there was something amid the constant greyness and i fell quickly into the bush and did sweat very chill but yet did haste to look and i saw now that there were in truth matters that did show vague upon that part of the plain that was before me and i did peer very constant and anxious and behold i saw that there was facing me a great line of quiet and lofty figures shrouded unto their feet and they moved not neither made they any sound but stood there amid the greyness and did seem to make an unending watch upon me so that my heart went unto weakness and i did feel that there was no power of the moss bushes to hide me for in verity they that stood so silent were certain of the silent ones and i was very nigh to the place of destruction now i moved not for a time but was made stiff by the greatness of my fear yet i was presently aware that the silent ones came not towards me but stood quiet as that they did mind not to slay me if but i did keep from that place and there grew therefrom a little courage into mine heart and i obeyed my spirit and took an hold of my strength and went slowly backward in the bushes and presently i was come a long way off yet troubled and disturbed and very strict to my going and i made a great circling about that place where the plain of the silent ones did come outward and so did gain to the north west and was thence something the happier in my heart and went easily and oft upon my feet yet making a strong watching to every side and so i came at the last to a time when i had walked through four and twenty weariful hours and was eager that i should come to a safe place for my sleep yet did lack a happy belief of safety in that i had come twice anigh to so grim trouble and unsure i was that i did not be secretly pursued in the night and this you shall believe to be a very desperate feeling and a plight to make the heart sick and to long with a great longing for the safety of that mine home yet had i put myself to the task and truly i did never cease to the sorrowful remembering of that utter despair that had sounded to me plain in the last calling of mine own love out of all the mystery of the night and but to think upon this was to grow strong in the spirit yet to have a fresh anxiousness that i did the more surely keep my life within me and so come to that maid's salvation now as you shall mind i had spied the shine of certain fire holes somewhat to the northward and had thought to make thereabouts a place for my sleep for in truth there was a bitterness of cold in all the air of night that did surround me and i was warmed nigh to a slow happiness by thinking upon a fire to lie beside and small wonder as you shall say and i made presently a strong walking unto that place where did glow in the night the shine of the fire holes as i did well judge them to be and so was like to have come over swiftly upon my death as you shall presently see for as i came anigh to the first i perceived that the light came upward out of a great hollow among the moss bushes and that the fire hole burned somewhere in the deep of the hollow so that i did but look upon the shine thereof yet very eager was i to come to that warmth and i made more of haste than care as i did hint and so came very swift to the top of the hollow yet was still hidden by the kindness of the moss bushes and as i made to thrust forward out of the bushes that i might look and go downward into the hollow there rose up to me the sound of a very large voice and deep and husky and the voice was a dreadful voice that did speak as that it said ordinary things and in a fashion so monstrous as that it were that a house did speak and in verity this is a strange thing to say yet shall it have the truth of my feelings and terror in that moment and i drew back swiftly from discovering myself and was then all feared to move or to make to go more backward lest that i should give knowledge that i was come anigh and likewise did i shiver lest that i was even then perceived and so shall you have something of the utter fear that did shake me and i abode there very quiet and moved not for a very great space but did sweat and shake for there was a monstrous horridness in the voice that did speak and as i crouched there within the moss bushes there came again the large voice and it was answered by a second voice and thereupon there arose as it did seem the speech of men that must have the bigness of elephants and that did have no kindness in all their thoughts but were utter monstrous and the speech was slow and it rose up out of the hollow brutish and hoarse and mighty and i would that i could make you to hear it and that you could but borrow mine ears for a little moment and forthwith be shaken with that utter horror and an afraidness even as was i now presently there was a very long quiet and i ceased at last a little from mine over fear and later i did calm somewhat so that i made to shift my position which was grown very uneasy and there was still no sound from the hollow wherefore having a little boldness and much curiousness and these despite my great fearfulness i put forth mine hand very cautious and did move the mossbush a little from my face and i went forward upon the earth and did lie upon my belly and was by this so close upon the edge of that place that i was abled to look downwards and you shall know that i peered down into that great hollow and did see a very strange and horrid sight for in truth there was a large fire hole in the centre of that place and all about the sides there were great holes into the slopes of the hollow and there were great men laid in the holes so that i might see a great head that did show out to my sight here from one of those holes and would seem to be that of a monstrous man heavy with sleep and there i would see but the buttocks of another as that he did curl himself inward to his brutish slumbering and so was it all about and to my memory there were maybe a score of these holes yet had i not time to the counting as you shall see for after that i had made but a glance as it were at these sleeping and utter monstrous men i perceived that there sat beyond the fire hole three great men and they were each greater than elephants and covered a large part with a stiff and horrid hair that did be of a reddish seeming and there were upon them great segs and warts as that their skin had been hides that had never known covering and there was between them the body of a mighty hound so big as an horse that they did skin and i judged that this beast was one of those fearsome brutes which we did call the night hounds yet as i should set down they did nothing in that time in which i lookt at them but did sit each with a sharp and monstrous bloody stone in his fist and did look to the ground as that they heeded not the earth or the food that they did prepare but did listen to some outward sound and you shall know that this brought to me a very swift and sudden terror for i perceived now the why of their long silence for in verity they had an unease upon them being subtly aware that one was anigh even as are the brute beasts in this manner and kind as all do know and i made to draw back and win unto safety if indeed this thing were to be done and as i moved me it may be that i shook a little earth into the hollow for there was indeed a little sifting of dry dust below me as i did wot being very keen to hear by reason of my fright and immediately did those three monstrous men look upward and did seem to me to stare into mine eyes as i did lie there hid amid the moss bushes and i was so put in fear that i did clumsily and sent another siftering of dust downward as i did strive to go backward swift and quiet from the edge and all the time i did look through the bushes very fixedly into the eyes of the giants and lo their eyes did shine red and green like to the eyes of animals and there rose up a roar from them that did nigh slay my soul with the horridness of the noise and at that roaring all the giants that did lie in the holes did awake and began to come outward into the hollow now i was surely lost and given over to destruction for they had possessed me immediately but that in that moment as i went backward the earth gave behind me and i fell into a hole among the moss bushes to my back and i made first to come out very hurried and all choked with a dust of sand and ash but in a moment i was sane to know that i had come to a sudden hiding place and i lay very still and strove neither to cough nor to breathe and well for me i came to so close a hiding for there were all about me the sounds of monstrous footsteps running that seemed to shake the ground though maybe this to be an imagining bred of my fear and shoutings of great voices there were and the thudding of huge feet all about and the noises of the bushes rustling but presently the search drew away to the southward and i perceived that there had surely fought for me some power of good fortune and i came up out of the hole very cautious and shaken and a moment weak with the beating of my heart yet with a lovely thankfulness for my salvation and i gat me about and went swift through the moss bushes to the north and west for three hours and ceased not to run upon my hands and knees and by that time was i come a great way and did have a surety in my heart of present safety and i ceased to run and lay quiet for in truth i did near swoon away with the hardness of my travel and indeed as you shall know i had slept not for seven and twenty hours and had scarce ceased to labour in all that time moreover i had eat not neither drunk for nine hours and so shall you conceive that i was truly a weary and presently i did slumber there as i lay and all abroad to any monstrous thing that should come along yet did i wake unharmed and found by my dial there had gone by a full ten hours the while that i did lie there and sleep unwotting and i was sore perished with the cold of the night for i had not the warmth of my cloak about me and my belly was very empty and i stood me up and did peer about for any dread matter but all seemed proper and i began to stamp my feet against the earth as that i would drive it from me and this i do say as a whimsy and i swung mine arms as often you shall do in the cold days and so i was presently something warmed and i dismantled my cloak and wrapped it about me and did feel that the diskos was safe to my hip then did i sit me down and did glow a little with relish in that i should now eat four of the tablets for indeed these were my proper due by reason of my shiftless fasting ere i came so wotless to my slumbering and the memory of that eating doth live with me now so that i could near to smile for the eagerness of mine inwards was proper and human yet were even four tablets but a little matter to so great an emptyness and i drank a double portion of the water that i might make less the void and this thing was seemly for indeed there were two portions due unto me and when i had eat and drunk i did fold the cloak once more to shape across my shoulder as i did carry it and afterwards i took the diskos into my hand and went forward again to the north and west yet as you shall know i did pause a little in the beginning and peer to every side for any close danger and then did look more abroad of that place but could nowhere see any matter to have me to immediate fear and afterwards i looked a little while at the monstrous humped back of the watcher of the north west and it did grow to me how steadfast that thing did look toward the mighty pyramid and this set me to new hatred and horror of the monster as you shall conceive and believe and presently i looked beyond the watcher unto the vast mountain of the great redoubt and i was still seeming close upon it yet in truth gone a long and weariful distance but this you shall understand was by the greatness and utter height and bulk of that shining mountain of life and strange and wonderful it was to me to think that even in that one moment it might be that the dear master monstruwacan did look upon my face through the great spy glass and i should not seem utter far to him by reason of the power of the big glass but to me as i did look upward through the night unto that far and utmost light in the upper blackness of the everlasting gloom it did seem doubly to me that i was afar off and lost forever from mine home and this thinking did breed in me such a great and lonesome feeling and a weakness of the heart and spirit that forthwith i took my courage close unto me and did turn away quickly and went onward to the north and west as i have told now i walked for twelve hours and in that time did eat and drink twice and made onward again very steadfast and happy that all did go so quiet with me so that it was as if i had at last come to a part of the land that was given over to quietness and lacking of monsters yet in truth was i come to a worse place than any maybe for as i went forward striding very strong and making a good speed i did hear presently a little noise upward in the night and someways unto my left that had seeming as that it were a strange low sound that did come down to me out of an hidden doorway above for indeed though the sound did come from very nigh as it did seem no more than a score feet above my head yet was it a noise that did come out of a great and mighty distance and out of a foreign place and i did know the sound though never as you may suppose could i have heard it in all my life yet had i read in one of the records and again in a second and a third how that certain of all they that had adventured from the pyramid into the night land to seek for knowledge had chanced to hear a queer and improper noise above them in the night and the noise had been strange and did come from but a little way upward in the darkness yet was also from a great and monstrous distance and did seem to moan and hum quietly and to have a different sounding from all noises of earth and in the records it was set forth that these were those same doorways in the night which were told of in an ancient and half doubted tale of the world that was much in favour of the children of the pyramid and not disdained by certain of our wiser men and had been thus through all the latter ages and i did seem to know the sound upon the moment for my heart grew swift to understand and it was a very dread uncomfortable sound and you shall know how it did seem if you will conceive of a strange noise that doth happen far away in the country and the same noise to seem to come to you through an opened door near by and this is but a poor way to put it yet how shall i make the thing more known to you so that i must even trust unto your wit and true sympathy that you shall conceive of the fullness of my meaning now in all the histories of those that had adventured into the night land there were but three sure records that did concern this sound and each did tell of a great horror and of them that did hear the sound there had died the most part out in the night land and the records did make always that they had come upon destruction and not simply unto death but were destroyed by a strange and invisible evil power from the night and of those that came alive unto the pyramid they had all one strange tale to tell how that there were secret and horrid doorways in the night yet how this thing could be plain to them who may know truly save it be that the eyes of their spirits did behold that which was hid to the eyes of the flesh and there was afterwards writ a proper and careful treatise and did set out that there did be ruptures of the aether the which did constitute doorways as those more fanciful ones did name them and through these shatterings which might be likened unto openings there being no better word to their naming there did come into this particular condition of life those monstrous forces of evil that did dominate the night and which many did hold surely to have been given this improper entrance through the foolish and unwise wisdom of those olden men of learning that did meddle overfar with matters that did reach in the end beyond their understanding and this thing have i told before and it doth seem proper unto my belief for it is always thus and i have that same taint within me as must all that have the zest of life now by this that i have set down swiftly to make a little clear the sure horridness of this sound you shall know even with me the great horror that did come immediately upon my spirit and i did know that my search was surely like to have an end in that moment and i bared mine arm for my teeth where the capsule did lie below the skin and so was ready to an instant death if that destruction did come upon me and in the same moment i did fall silent inward among the moss bushes and did begin to creep very quiet toward the right for as you will mind i had heard the sound over beyond my left and all that time as i did creep there was a great sickness upon me and it did seem that my mouth had weakened unto water so that i could scarce hold my teeth tightly from unseemly clitterings and i crept always very silent and did often stare quick and painful over my shoulder upwards and this way and that but did never see anything neither could i hear now the sound and i went thiswise for a great hour and was like to faint through the effort of my care and the soreness of my going but upon the end of that long while i grew something easier in the spirit and did perceive that i was saved from the destruction that i had come so dreadful anigh and this thing it may be was because that i did chance to hear it whilst yet it was beyond and before i did come right unto it to pass below yet may i be wrong in this thought and do but make a guessing but as i shall here explain after that time i kept mine ears newly keen unto hearing and did chide my spirit for that it had not taken account of that sound a great while earlier yet as i did presently conceive the spirit had no power to hear that thing which was very strange but truly so now because that i went with a very wary hearing i heard the sound once a far way off before me and i hid upon the moment and went backward and after a while did judge myself to have come unto safety and so it was in verity for i heard no more that time and so did i come presently unto the eighteenth hour and did eat and drink and made me a place of slumber in a little hollow of a rock that stood upward out of the moss bushes and i slept for six hours and afterwards waked and was come to no harm and after i had eat and drunk again i did look outward over the night land and with particularness to that part that i did travel in as it might be called the yesterday and i did observe it to be a very bleak and desolate country and not given over to fire or other warmth nor to sulphur vapours but to be very quiet and with but a little light in all its breadth and i could conceive that it was no place for anything of life to desire but rather to avoid and that country did seem to be yet all about me for i was by no means come clear from it at that time though northward there was a glimmer as of fire holes and beyond those the strange shining of the plain of blue fire and after that i had thought awhile i did believe that i should meet no monster of natural life in all that country of desolation until i did draw nigh once more unto fire and i conceived that this sound from out of the invisible doorways might yet trouble me but whether the quietness of that part was because all of natural life did fear the sound or because that there was neither fire nor warmth i do not say having no knowing in this matter but may yet believe that it was to be laid to both causes and this doth seem of common reason as you shall agree and when i had looked a while unto the mighty pyramid which was now truly a great way off for i had walked so many weary hours i turned me once more to my journeying and here let me observe that i had gone very far yet not so distant as might be thought for oft i did go less than one mile in an hour or maybe two hours having to be of great caution and oft to hide and to go upon my belly or to crawl all as might be and further as you may have perceived i made not a straight forwardness but did strike this way and that way being very intent to escape the monsters and evil forces that were all about now because that i believed that i travelled in a place where was surely to be discovered those strange doorways within the night i made an especial care of my going and did stop oft that i might listen and watch and keep a very strict ward in all the night about me yet as you shall see this served not to prevent me from going forward into the fearfulness of that which did haunt all the void for sudden as i went carefully i heard a faint humming noise come downward from the night a little unto my rear and the humming noise did grow more plain as that a door were opened slowly above and did let out that sound ever more loud and surely after i did hear that i could not doubt that a door were opened upward there for the noise did grow in such wise as you shall hear a distant sound come through when a door truly is oped for if the noise had been made just in that place it had seemed to come from there but this sound though it did come through there was as that it did come outward from some far lost and foreign eternity and this i do struggle always to make plain and you shall not blame me that i think overmuch upon it for in truth there was an horror so wondrous and drear about it that i can forget not but do strive always that others should know with me that peculiar woe and terror that did haunt the night now as you will see i had in truth gone past the place where the doorway in the night did open yet had come to no harm but rather it did seem that it opened by chance unwotting that i was anigh or it may be that my quiet passing did disturb an evil power so that it did even come to listen or to make search and all this doth pass through my brain as i do write and it doth seem to me that my thoughts are but the thoughts of a little child before so great a mystery and that i touch not even the edge and fringe of the truth with my thinkings and so do cease upon them and will but go forward so plain as i may with my telling now as you may truly believe when i heard that sound and did understand that i had in verity come past beneath that place i did surely sicken to an utter weakness of body and heart though it was but for a moment and then was i swift hid within the close shelter of the low and thick moss bushes and i shook in all my being and crept shaking upon my hands and knees and did near totter to my face thrice so weak gone was i in that moment of terror and i did have a wickedness of forgetting in that time for i bared not mine arm to have the capsule to a readiness for my death if that did need to be and this was an abominable foolishness and i do shake now when i think upon it for death is but a little matter by the side of destruction though in truth dreadful enough for all yet as it did chance no harm came to me and i gat away as that some wondrous power did cast a viewless cloak about me that i might be utter hid and oft have i wondered whether this was truly so but have no knowing and presently i ceased from fleeing and had some calmness and did eat and drink and so came to the comfort of a firm spirit the which had been sore troubled above all understanded causes by that horrid sounding upward in the night and after that i had eat and drunk i did rest a little but afterward went onward to the northward going towards that place where the fire holes did glimmer the same being by this time no great way off then as i did come anigh i thought to hear once again the sound in the night and i stopt very swift and hid into the moss bushes and did listen but did hear naught and so was hopeful that fancy did play upon me yet because of this matter i went upon my hands and knees for a good way and so came at last nigh unto the shine of one of those fire holes the which i did see for so long now as you shall suppose i went very cautious through the bushes unto that red shining fire being careful both that i did attract not any evil force that might listen in the night and because that there might be some monster nigh to the fire hole but presently when i was come so that i could peer through the bushes i did see a little fire hole set in a small hollow and there did no thing seem to lurk anigh and the sight of that warmth did cheer me for it was long since i did have the comfort of such a matter and when i had lain hid awhile that i might watch all about i saw the place to be safe and quiet and i went out from the moss bushes and sat down a space from the fire which did fill the pit in which it did lift and bubble and the noise that it sent out was strange and slow and it did seem to gruntle gently unto itself in that lonesome hollow as that it had made a long and quiet grumbling there through eternity and oft was it still and made no sound and again would give an odd bubbling in the quietness and send off as it did seem a little smoke of sulphur and afterward fall once more upon a quiet and so i did sit there very hushed and restful and the loneliness did lie all about me and the red shine of the fire hole did glow soft in the hollow and i was glad to be quiet for my heart was weary and there was to my back a little rock that did jut upward so high as a man and the rock was warm and pleasant to lean upon and moreover did seem to guard me from behind and there i ate and drunk and kept very still and so was presently rested and this i did need as you have perceived for i was gone sudden weary of the heart as i did say and this might be because that i did never cease to have destruction over me to companion my way though as you will mind i had been no more than twelve hours afoot since my last sleeping yet i doubt not you do understand and presently my heart grew strong again within me and i had a warmth in my spirit and i got up from the earth and stretched out mine arms and i saw that my gear was safe upon me and afterward did grip the diskos as it were newly then i went away from the fire hole and climbed the far slope of the hollow and went northward and there were before me many of the fire holes for i did perceive them to shine in the night for a great way as it did seem that they were a path of red shinings that led me onward to the north west of the light of the plain of blue fire now i had a believing that i had come out of the country where did lurk those horrid doorways in the night and i went not with so utter a weight upon my heart and did feel that naught should come now upon the back of my neck which had been an odd and troublesome fancy whilst that i did creep through that country of gloom yet as you shall know i went with no foolish confidence but with a great caution and mine hearing keen to hark and a care to my steps and did ever watch around me as i journeyed and because that i went forward in this proper and sedate manner i had great cause for a thankful heart as you may perceive for i had come after a long way to another of those hollows where did burn one of the fire holes and i made a pause upon the edge of the hollow in which it did lie and looked downward keeping guarded within the moss bushes where they grew anigh to the top thereof but there was no living thing there to be seen and i went downward so that i should warm my body at the fire and lo as i stood upon this side of the fire hole and turned myself about i looked presently more keenly to the other side for the yellowness of the earth did seem a little strange in one place but i could see with no plainness because that there arose a glare from the fire against mine eyes and i went round that i should look the better yet with no fear or thought of evil in my heart and truly when i was come upon that far side of the fire hole lo there was spread out in the yellow sand of that place a curious thing and i went more nigh and stooped to look upon it and behold it moved and the sand all about did move for a great space so that i gave back very swift and swung upward with the diskos and strangely i heard the sand to stir at my back and i looked round very quick and the sand rose upward in parts and sifted back and there came to my sight odd things that did move and curl about and immediately before i knew which way to go i knew that the sand did shift under my feet and did work and heave so that i was tottered and was shaken also in the heart for i knew not what to think in that instant then did i perceive that i was all surrounded and i ran swift upon the heaving sand unto the edge of the fire hole and i turned there and looked quickly for i did not know what this new terror should be and i saw that a yellow thing did hump upward from out of the sand as it had been a low hillock that did live and the sand shed downward from it and it did gather to itself strange and horrid arms from the sand all about it and it stretched two of the arms unto me but i smote with the diskos and i smote thrice and afterward they did wriggle upon the sand but this was not the end as i did hope for the yellow thing arose and ran at me as it might be that you should see a spider run and i did leap backward this way and that but the monster had a great swiftness so that i did seem surely lost then made i a strong and instant resolve for i perceived that i had no hope to slay this thing save that i should come at it in the body and i put everything to the chance and made not to escape any more but ran straight in among the legs and there were great hairs like to spines upon the legs and these had pricked me to the death but that the armour saved me now i had done this thing with a wondrous quickness so that i was under the mighty arching of the legs before the yellow thing did wot of my intent and the body was bristled with the great hairs and poison did seem to come from them and to ooze from them strangely in great and shining drops and the monster heaved itself up to one side that it might bring certain of the legs inward to grasp me yet in that moment did i smite utter fierce with the diskos thrusting and the diskos did spin and hum and roar and sent out a wondrous blaze of flame as that it had been a devouring death and it sundered the body of the yellow thing and did seem as that it screamed to rage amid the entrails thereof so wondrous was the fury and energy of that trusted weapon and i was covered with the muck of the thing and the claws upon the legs seized me so that the grey armour did bend and crack to the might thereof and i grew sick unto death with the pain within but smote with the shining diskos using my left hand weakly for my right was gript dreadful fast to my body and lo i was sudden free and a great blow did knock me far across the hollow so that i was like to have fallen into the fire hole but fell instead upon the edge and came backward unto safety and i turned me about and the yellow thing did throw the sand all ways as it did die but had lost power to come upon me and for my part i lay weak upon the earth and was no more able to fight nor could i do more than breathe for a great while but yet came presently to health and made to examine my hurts then i saw there was no great wound anywhere upon me but only an utter bruising and i found upon my right leg that there was a sharp and hairy claw clipt about it but the armour had saved me from harm of the horrid thing so that i did but kick it free with my left foot and thence into the fire hole now by this time that monstrous creature was dead but i held off from it and went upon the other side of the fire for i was yet surely in horror of it and i sat for a time and did think upon all matters that did concern me and i saw that i should have not comfort of heart until i was washed clean from the taint of the monster and i gat me up wearily to go forth into the night again that i should make a search for a hot spring of which i had come past many and i had oft found them to be nigh unto the fire holes so that i was trustful that i should see one ere long and lo there was a little hollow just beyond and scarce a hundred paces off and in the hollow there did shine three small fire holes and there was a steaming puddle as did seem beyond the third of the holes now before i adventured downward into this place i went all about the topmost edge and made a search of the moss bushes about but found naught that should scare me and afterward i went all across the hollow but did find no monstrous thing hid anywheres yet there was that in the place that discouraged me and did keep me from stripping mine armour so that i should bathe in the hot puddle for i stept upon a small serpent and the same did lap about my leg but could do me no hurt for the armour which was a very blessed protection and i freed myself from it with the handle of the diskos and because that i could not go naked to my cleansing i tried first the hotness of the water which was not over great and afterward did take off the scrip and the pouch and the cloak and laid them with the diskos upon the edge of the warm puddle then i stept into the water and was immediately gone downward a great way for truly it was no puddle as i had supposed but a deep well as you might call it of hot and sulphury water and this doth show how a man may act foolishly even when he doth believe that he hath a great caution and surely it is borne in upon me afresh that none should trust over freely unto unproven matters the which shall you heartily agree with but yet do as foolishly according to your lights and characters and so shall you laugh not over hardly upon me now i had gone over the head and surely i do not know what deepness was there yet as you shall think i stayed not to consider upon this matter but made to climb out and much shaken with my splutterings and the smartings of mine eyes for truly the water was strong with sulphur matters yet very cleansing was it as i did presently see for there was no more any taint or horridness upon mine armour or the flesh of my face or hands and i took the diskos and washed it clean also and then the cloak and afterward the scrip and the pouch and the bands of the same and after i had done this i was minded to dry myself by the little fire holes but when i was come there lo maybe a score small serpents were about those places and i was strongly pleased that i should keep away yet that i must warm and dry me in that desolate and bitter night land you shall agree and to this end i put the scrip and the pouch upon me and afterwards took the diskos readily into my hand and ran quietly unto the hollow where i did fight with the yellow thing and the cloak i bore in my left hand now when i was gat there i was truly glad to think that there were no serpents in that place and because that i had slain the monster of the place how should it be that any harm might come unto me for truly was it not like that a creature of such might should keep all that hollow unto itself and slay any that did come therein and thereby preserve that place from all other horror though surely until it did die and cease to be there had been no call for any greater abomination now all this did go through my brain as i did sit to dry mine armour and my body and my gear upon that side of the fire hole which was away from the slain monster and i made presently to think that this would be a sure and proper refuge wherein to sleep for truly it must have gotten a place where none other creature should be like to come to work me harm and it must be that you do all see with me in this matter and commend me that i thought with properness and so did i resolve that i put my disgust within my pocket as we do say and stay safe and quiet within that hollow and this thing i did surely and did eat and drink and presently i went over to the dead monster and made very sure that it was truly slain which indeed it was and after that i had seen to this matter i returned unto the fire hole and made a comfortable place in the sand for my rest for i was well dry by this and i wrapped the cloak about me and took the diskos to my breast for a sure companion as it had truly proved in my need and i could think almost that it did nestle unto me as that it knew and loved me but this thing can be no more than a fancy and i do but set it down as such and that it doth show my feeling and mind at that time then ere i did compose myself to slumber i looked about me upward to the edges of the hollow and i perceived that i was lost to the sight of the mighty pyramid for i was come so far off that it looked not down from so wondrous a height as you shall perceive and moreover the hollow was something deep and afterward as i lay my head back upon the scrip and the pouch which were to me my pillow i went to think a little upon naani as alway i did in my constant journeying yet presently i strove sometimes that i put her from my mind that i should sleep for a bitter sorrow and anxiousness was oft upon me when that i did think upon her and this you may know for truly i knew not what terror was come to her afar in the silence of the night and did i think overmuch i should feel that i could have no calmness needful to sleep but to need to walk for ever until i died which could not be long and so should i make a foolishness of mine anxious journeying to do her true service and to save her from destruction if such did truly threaten and i was soon gone over to sleep and waked not for seven hours being much wearied by the fight and the soreness of my body the which did put me into a great pain as i did rise upward from my slumber but this was presently something less and i eat two of the tablets and drank some of the water and afterward did put my gear upon me and went forward into the night having the diskos in my hand and my heart was glad that i had come safe through the time of my sleep now i walked six hours and did stop a little to eat and drink and went on again and it was in this second third of the day that i saw afar to my right two strange and wondrous men and they did shine as they had been made of a pale mist and they came anigh going very swift and did seem as that they were maybe forty feet high yet having no thickness and i hid downward into the moss bushes and they past me so quiet as a cloud of this day might go and did appear to be if i did guess but an hundred fathoms off yet was this no sure thing for their position had no more surety than shall a rainbow have in this age and so they were gone onward into the night and did seem to come out of the north and they did appear not to wot of me and whether they were harmful i know not for they harmed not me and i lay there in the moss bushes until they were well gone away and i had belief that they must be those same mist men that were told of in certain of the olden records but were never seen anigh to the pyramid though i had thought odd times to see men as of mist through the great spy glass when i was within the tower of observation but they were always a mighty way off and some would say it was but a bright vapour that did move yet would others be in doubt and so is it ever in such matters and here let me take chance to say how that it is a hard thing to speak of such happenings to men of this age and to make the truth proper unto them and because of this oft am i tempted to say no word upon many things that i did see yet must i tell my tale or suffer from the weight of it within me and so shall you hark to me and give me your sympathy and human understanding and concerning these mist men i have wondered oft whether they were the visible shape of some of those many forces that were abroad in the night land for they did truly seem to me as that a thing of strange life were half shown to my human eyes yet i do not know and am but telling of my natural thoughts and ponderings now as i did say those mist men were never seen nigh unto the pyramid and were as i did hint always so far off that they were half given over to the fables of the olden days in the beliefs of the peoples of the mighty redoubt and set about with an halo of unrealness for none within the great pyramid had ever beheld them with surety and because that now i saw them anigh to me it was borne in afresh upon my spirit how greatly i had wandered away and how that i stood afar in the lonesomeness of that land of night as it had been that a man of this age did wander amid the stars and perceive a great comet to go by him very close for then he should know in his heart how that he was far off in the void and this i do say to you that you may know somewhat of the emotions of my heart in that moment yet presently i shook free of my melancholy and lonesomeness and rose up out of the moss bushes and went onward and as ever i thought much upon the maid that i did search for yet strove to think quietly concerning her state else should i have turned to running and wrecked my body before that i had gone any great way and that day i passed seven large fire holes and two that were small and always i came softly unto them for there were oft living things about the warmth and at the sixth fire hole i did see that which i did think to be a great man that did sit to the fire with monstrous knees drawn upward unto his chin and the nose was great and bent downward and the eyes very large and did shine with the light from the fire hole and moved watching always this way and that so that the white parts did show now this side and now that but it was not properly a man and i went away very quiet from that place and looked oft backward until that i was sure of safety for it was a very horrid monster and had that place to be for a lair as i did judge from the smell thereof and when the eighteenth hour was come i looked about for a safe place to my sleep and i kept away now from the fire holes for i did always find the more life there yet when i came to my rest i was lacking of warmth by reason of this care and could scarce sleep at all because that i was so cold yet managed something of slumber after a while but woke very stiff and was glad to beat my hands and bestir myself that i should come to some warmth of life and after that i had eat and drunk i put my gear upon me and took the diskos in my hand and went forward again upon my journey and here i should tell that i was come soon unto the north west border of the plain of blue fire and presently i was but a little way off from it and did go direct to the north so that the plain was always upon my right now this plain was a strange and fearsome place as you shall see for it was as that a blue void did rise upward from the earth in all the country of that plain for surely the plain did not lumber with flame but was hid with a strange and inburning light as of a shining atmosphere of a cold blue colour and it did throw no sure light upon the night land as had seemed proper but was a very dreadful cold shining as of a luminous and blue void and the moss bushes grew nigh to the edge of the plain and did show to me black and strange against that horrid gloom of light and you shall know that i could not see into the plain for it was as that the cold blue light was a void that swallowed all within it and gave no power to the eye that aught should be perceived and it stood between me and the mighty pyramid and i could nowise see across and i know not whether i do make all this matter clear unto you for surely it is no easy task and presently i had gone very quiet upon my hands and knees through the moss bushes and i came near upon the edge of the plain and hid there in a clump of the moss bush and peered forth and harked and i heard constant voices that did call to one another across the plain as it were that strange peoples of spirits did wander within that blue shining and did make a calling one to the other and were all hid and held apart and surely i could see naught and did judge as i have writ that they likewise went blindly and truly is this a strange matter to set out and easy to think on with doubt yet as i did see so have i told for in verity there were surely hidden peoples of spirits scattered and lost afar upon that improper plain and you shall judge that i kept safe hid for whether this might have any natural explaining or whether it was a matter that did go utter beyond knowledge of man i did not know for surely in that strange land it did like to be an horrid danger in any case and whether of some monstrous creatures or of the evil forces of the land i did wisely to be away and for two days i did make a safe coasting of the plain of blue fire and did keep well off maybe two great miles among the moss bushes and i made a very good speed through the darkness and at the eighteenth hour of each journey i made a place for my slumber and the first i did manage under a thick bush but the second was high upon the ledge of a rock that grew upward in the night amid the bushes and save that i was bitter cold there did no harm come to me and in all that time of journeying i had no sight of the mighty pyramid for the blind shining of the plain of blue fire was ever between now there had been certain little matters in my journey beside the plain of blue fire which i have not set down for they were of no account and do but repeat much that i have told before and indeed there was naught in that part of my journey save that i did pass nineteen great fire holes and four small and did observe no life beside any save about one of the great holes that there was no hollow around and here i did happen to see some strange and ugly creatures so big as my head that did have a look of the scorpion of this age but proportioned more squat and thick yet though they were naught to remark upon in that land they had been but woeful bedmates to any man as you may think and you shall know how it gave a rest to my spirit that i did go so long with no trouble of the monsters of the night or the evil forces thereof and i grew bolder to my journeying and made ever a greater speed of going and it was like that i took presently a less heed for my safety which was a wrong and foolish state yet there came no harm unto me in all that part of my travel then it was in the sixteenth hour of the third day of my journey beside the plain that i did come out beyond the end of it and had fresh sight of the mighty pyramid afar in the night upon my right and i stopt there in a bare place among the moss bushes and did in a weak moment hold up the diskos so that i make a salute unto the pyramid mine home for truly was i so utter glad to behold it once more and in a little while was i aware that there was a disturbance of the aether of the world all about me so that it did seem that there had been one at the great spy glass to watch for my coming into their sight from behind the shining of the plain of blue fire and it was like that news had gone downward through the cities of the great redoubt so that they did print the word of it in the hour slips and by this there would be many great millions thinking upon me and a rushing unto the embrasures that they might spy out at me yet i doubt that any glass might perceive me surely at so great a space save the power of the great spy glass in the tower of observation but the emotion of the millions to reach to me and you shall know that it did seem homely and sweet unto me to hear all about me the shaking of the aether of the world and to be ware that so many did think humanly upon me and had prayers unto my safety and it was a strange thing to stand so utter far off in the night and to look back to that everlasting hill of light that was grown something small by the distance and to have surety that i was lookt upon through the great spy glass maybe by the kindly eye of my dear friend the master monstruwacan and so keenly that he could it might be make almost to guess the look within mine eyes as i did gaze backward unto that mine home yet though this dear and homely sympathy was a sweet and companionable thing to my heart it came swift to my thought that i was in a sore danger if that they ceased not quickly to think so onely upon me for surely was i not come over near unto that dreadful house of silence and well might so much emotion of the millions tell unto the horrid power that dwelt within how that i was even anigh and so shall you see the mixt feelings that came upon me everyway yet as it did chance the aether was quieted in a little for it did need unity of the millions being that they were untrained to their spiritual powers to stir the aether and so was i more easy of mind and went forward again upon my way now as it did chance at the eighteenth hour i was come to a place where i heard a noise of water and i went to my left that i might come upon it and there boiled a hot fountain that went up out of the rock of that place and the water rose upward in a column and was maybe so thick as my body and it fell unto the north for the water came not up straightly but did shoot out from the earth unto that way and i saw the thing plain for there were many fire holes all about as you shall have wotted from my telling and so was there a certain and constant light in that part of the land and i followed the water that ran from the fountain and tried it with mine hand but found it to burn and so did go further beside it for presently it should be no hotter than i did need and it went onward winding among the moss bushes and sent up a constant steam that hung about it and the steam made a red cloud about the way that it did go for the lights from the fire holes made a shining upon it and so was it a wondrous pretty sight now presently i tried the stream again and found it to be nicely warm and i sat upon a little rock and took off my foot gear that i might bathe my feet which were gone something tender moreover i did ache to have the sweetness of water about me and i made that i should bathe my feet and afterwards find a place among the moss bushes and so eat and drink and have my slumber then as i did sit there beside that warm stream with my feet dabbled therein i heard sudden afar off the voice of a mighty night hound baying in the night and the sound came from the north west of the plain of blue fire and there was afterward a quiet and you shall see me sitting there upon the rock by the side of that smoking river and the steam all about me and my feet within the lovely warmth of the water and i very still and frozen with a sudden fear for it did seem to me in an instant that the night hound might surely be upon the track of my goings and after that there had passed a little time the while that i did listen very keen lo there burst out in the night as it did seem scarce a mile off the monstrous deep baying of the giant hound and i knew surely that the brute did track me and a sick and utter horror did fall upon me so that i could scarce get my foot gear upon me once more yet in truth i was not long to the matter and was to my feet and did hold the diskos ready and very desperate i was to the heart for it is ever a fearsome thing to be put in chase and the worse an hundred times when there is a sure knowledge that a deathly monster doth be the pursuer now i did stand there but a moment it did seem to make an anxious considering how that i might best assure me some chance to live through this swift coming danger and then did i think upon the stream to use it and i leapt quick therein and did run very strong down the middle part which was nowheres so much as thigh deep and oft not above mine ankles and as i did run there came again the bellow of that dire brute following and was now as mine ears did say scarce the half of a mile to my rear and i did run but the stronger for the dread of the sound and so maybe for a little minute and after that time i stopt from mine heavy running and went very wary that i made no loud splashing for by now the monster brute should be something anigh to that place where i did enter the stream and i looked round with a constant looking but did see no surely visible thing though my fear did shape me an hound from every shadow of the moss bushes about me then in a moment i did hear the great beast for it bayed but a little way up the stream as that it had overshot the place where the scent did end and immediately i sank swiftly into the water which was there so deep as my knee and turned upon my belly and the water surged over my shoulders for i kept my head above and so i did look eager and fearful through the steam into the shadows and the half darkness towards where i did think to see the night hound and in a moment i saw it coming and it was a little vague by reason of the smoke of the river yet did seem black and monstrous in the gloom and great as a mighty horse and it went past me at a vast and lumbersome gallop but i did not see it in that moment for i dived my head down unto the rock of the river bottom and held downward until that i was like to burst for sore longing of breath then i put upward my head and took swift and deep breathings and lookt about me very cautious and fearful as you can know and i heard the night hound casting round among the moss bushes and it did send up a wild and awesome baying and i heard the bushes brake and smash beneath it as it did run to and hither and afterward there was a quiet yet i moved not but stayed there very low in the water and did have a thankful heart that it was warm and easy to persist in for i had surely died of a frozen heart if that it had been cold for by this time you do know even with me how bitter was the chill of the land now i had been awhile lain thus upon my belly and heard no sound from the monstrous hound yet i ceased not to be full of an horrid unease concerning the great beast for i did better to know what it did than to have no knowing and sudden i heard the sound of it running very swiftly and coming nigh and it passed me and did go up the stream and there was surely a quick stupor upon me for i ducked not my head under the water but stayed very still which as it did chance was maybe not such an utter foolishness for my head did seem in that half gloom to be mayhap no more than a little rock in the water and i made no move to tell of life yet should the hound have smelled me and that it failed in this matter doth be a puzzle to me and as the great night hound past me it tore the earth and the bushes with the exceeding strength that it put forth to run and clods of the earth and stones of bigness were cast this way and that by the feet of the hound running and so shall you have a little knowledge of the strength of that beast and the hound ran on into the distance and presently i heard it baying in the night then i rose and went onward down the warm stream and made a strong walking yet keeping alway to the water and oft did stop a little that i should listen and always i heard the night hound a great way off in the night baying and seeming that it did surely run to and fro searching now i journeyed thus for twelve hours and the baying of the hound making search did never cease and i kept always to the water as i did say that i should leave no scent unto the hound and by that twelve weary hours had gone i found that i was come anigh unto the house of silence and this put me in great trouble as you may perceive for surely had mine whole effort been to the end that i should avoid that house by a great way yet had the hound driven me thus a near now i saw that the small river did go onward and did make a breach across the road where the silent ones walk and i determined in my heart that i should leave the water which was now grown nigh to a bitter cold in that it was so long upon the face of the land yet chiefly did i mind to leave the water that i should come no more anigh unto that house of silence for the water did go that way and i stood awhile and did listen for the baying of the hound but could hear it no more and did have a surety within me that it was indeed gone from searching for me then i came out of the water and went forward stooping and creeping among the moss bushes going outward to the westward of north so that i should go away so quickly as i might from the nearness of the house yet lo i was gone upon my hands and knees no more than an hundred fathoms when i did find the moss bushes to cease to the westward for a great way and there to be a great bareness of rock which in truth was much shown thereabout and i dared not to go outward upon that naked land for then i had not been hid by the moss bushes but had stood plain there for all things of the night to behold and moreover though i could nowise have a sure knowledge concerning this matter yet did i hope within me that i should make a sure hiding from the power of the house of silence did i but go very low among the bushes but indeed it was like enough that naught could give me hiding yet should i lose no chance unto my safety and because of this i went backward among the bushes and ceased to escape out unto the westward and i found presently that the moss bushes made but a narrow growth in that path and grew only for a while by the side of the great road so that i was surely fain to keep nigh to the road that i have the covering of the bushes and in a while i found the road where the silent ones walk to bend inward at the north of the house of silence so that it came right horridly close unto the house for here the hill on which the house did stand was very abrupt and fell steeply unto the road and so was that dreadful house stood up there above me in the silence as that it did seem to brood there upon the land and this side did seem truly as the other and equal lone and dreadful and the house was monstrous and huge and full of quiet lights and it was truly as that there had been no sound ever in that house through eternity but yet was it as that the heart did think each moment to see quiet and shrouded figures within and yet never were they seen and this i do but set down that i bring all home unto your hearts also as that you crouched there with me in those low moss bushes there beside the great road and did look upward unto that monstrous house of everlasting silence and did feel the utterness of silence to hang about it in the night and to know in your spirits the quiet threat that lived silent there within and so shall you have mind of me hid there among the bushes and sodden and cold and yet as you will perceive so held in my spirit by an utter terror and loathing and solemn wonder and awe of that mighty house of quietness loomed above me in the night that i wotted not of the misery of my body because that my spirit was put so greatly in dread and terror for the life of my being and also you shall have before you how that i knew in all my body and soul that i stood anigh to that place where but a little while gone there had passed inward so dreadful to an everlasting silence and horrid mystery those poor youths and after that you have minded you of this you shall consider how that the memory of all my life held dread thoughts of the monstrousness of that house and now was i anigh unto it and it did seem to my soul that the very night about it held an anguish of quiet terror and always my mind did come back to the sheer matter that i was so anigh and this thing i do say unto you once and again for truly as you do see it hath imprinted itself deep into my spirit yet shall i now cease from saying further in this manner for surely you shall never know all that was in mine heart and if i cease not i do but be like to weary you and so did i hide and creep and oft pause to a time of shaking quiet and afterward gather something of new courage and go onward and peer upward at that monstrous house stood above me in the night yet as it did come about i came presently clear of that horrid place for the road came round again unto the north and i began that i made a better way through the moss bushes but never that i grew to much speed for i had oft to go about that i should miss a naked part here and another there for truly there was an abundance and bareness of rock so that the bushes grew not so thick as i could wish and in the space of five hours was i clear of that house and did have a greater ease about my heart but yet was not free to come to food nor to slumber the both of which i did sorely need for i had slept neither eat for a weariful time as you do know but first i must go further off from the house and afterwards come to some fire hole that i should dry myself and get warmth again into my body which was bitter cold and now that i had come unto the northward of the house of silence there came to me a great wonder which bred in me a mighty hope and gladness for as i did go among the bushes there broke sudden all around me in the aether the low and solemn beat of the master word and the throb of the word was utter weak so that one moment i did say unto myself that i heard and in a moment that i did not yet had i no proper doubt in my heart and i reasoned with myself and with a great shaking of excitement and expectation upon me that the master word came not from the great pyramid which should have power to send it as a great force across the everlasting night whilst that this that throbbed about me was faint and scarce to be known even unto the keenness of the night hearing which was mine and immediately as i crouched low there and thrilled with the hope that was bred in me lo there seemed to come the far faint voice of naani calling with a little voice within my spirit and i thought the cry to have an utterness of supplication within it so that i grew desperate to up and go to running yet did curb such foolishness and stayed very hushed to listen but i heard no more yet was shaken continually with the joy and hope which this calling did breed in me for truly did it seem now that i was right that i did determine to go unto the north for sure was i now that the lesser redoubt lay that way in the night and it did seem plain unto me that the house of silence had put a barrier between and had power to withhold so weak a calling and now had i come beyond the barrier and i did perceive in my heart how that naani had called off maybe in the sadness of despair yet had the weak crying of her brain elements been held from me by the horrid power of the house and surely as i did think it was well named for it did make a silence and so shall you stay with me in your hearts and take to ourselves something of the new gladness that held all my being for it did seem truly that my bitter task and adventuring should not in the end be offered to uselessness and that i did truly draw unto that far place in the everlasting night where mine own maid did cry for me that i should succour her and ever as i went did i hark but there was no more the low eating of the master word in the night not at that time and presently i spied outward to the west as it did seem a good mile off in the night the shining of a fire hole and i began to plan that i should come unto that place and have warmth and dryness and food and slumber and in verity so set was i to the need of these matters that if there did be a monstrous thing nigh to the fire as was so oft the case then would i give battle unto it for neither my joy nor my labours did serve to put warmth into my body and i must surely come anigh to fire or die then as i kneeled upward among the moss bushes and made to lay a true course unto the fire hole i perceived that there came a being along the road unto my right and i went low into the bushes and moved not for truly i had seen that there drew nigh one of the silent ones and i made a little place that should let me to see and i spied out with an utter caution and lo the being came on very quiet and with no hurry and in a time it went by me on the road and did take no heed to me yet did i feel that it had knowledge that i stoopt there among the moss bushes and it made no sound as it went and was a dreadful thing yet it did seem unto my heart as that it had no trouble of wanton malice to work needless destruction to any and this i crave strangely that you to understand for it was so to me that i had a quiet and great respect for that thing and did feel no hatred yet was very dreadly in fear of it and it was huge in size and was shrouded unto its feet and seemed maybe ten feet high yet presently it was gone onward down the road and i was no more troubled by it then did i make no waste of time but set off unto the fire hole and kept so much to shelter as i might but was oft made to run over baked places ere that i should come to more of the bushes and i came presently nigh unto the fire hole and made a pause and crept unto it with a great care and i found it to be in the bottom of a deep hollow of the rock of that part and the rock was clear looking of all living matters the which did make me to be glad and i went round about the top of the hollow carrying the diskos very handily but there was nowhere any living thing and i feared not to go downward into the deep hollow and so unto the fire hole which lay in the bottom as you have perceived and when i was come there i made a close search of the rock and found it was very sweet and warm and there were no serpents neither any stinging creatures so that a certain comfort came upon my spirit then stript i off mine armour and gear and afterward all my garments so that i stood naked there in the hollow yet was that place almost so warm as some mild oven and i had no fear to suffer from the cold of the night land but was uneasy lest that any monstrous thing should be anigh to come to take me so unawares now i wrung the garments and spread them upon the rock near unto the fire hole where it was hot and i did rub my body very brisk with my hands so that i glowed into health and had no fear of a stiffness and afterward i did look to my food and drink and to the matters in the pouch but there had no harm come to any by reason of the tightness of the scrip and the pouch that had kept off the water and i eat and drank there as i stood waiting for the garments to come to dryness and i walked about a little as i eat for i was restless to be into mine armour swiftly and now i did turn this garment upward of the dry side and now that but did find them to steam so that i turned them many times before they were proper yet in truth they dried in but a little while and i gat me into them very swift and into the armour and i felt the strength and courage of my spirit to come back into me which had gone outward somewhat when i did stand there so naked and this feeling you shall all have understanding of and know that you would have felt that way likewise had you but stood there in that land in so unhappy a plight and when i had come into mine armour i put my gear upon me and took the diskos into my hand and did climb out of the hollow for i would find a more secure place to my slumber and did not dare to sleep in that place for it was beyond seven and thirty hours since that i did have sleep though as i do see by my count i have made it to seem but as five and thirty yet was a part consumed in diverse matters that i have not set down and you shall mind how bitter had been my labour and weariness in all that time and i did know of a surety that sleep must come heavily upon me so that i was sorely in need that i should search out a safe place for i should not be lightly waked until that i had slept away the tiredness of my heart and the weariful achings from my body and indeed i should mind you how that i was not yet come perfect from the bruising which i had gotten from the fight with the yellow thing and presently when i had searched but a little while i did find that a rock stood upward from a great clumping of the moss bushes unto my left and i went over to the rock and made a search about it and i found that there was a hole into the bottom part of the rock and i thrust the diskos into the hole and made the blade to spin a little so that it sent out a light but there was no thing in the hole and it did seem a dry and safe place for my sleep then i turned me about and went into the hole with my feet that way and i found that it was so deep into the rock as the length of two men and just so wide as i could lie in it without having it to pinch me and there i made my bed in the hole and went swift unto my sleep and scarce had but a moment even to think upon naani and by this thing shall you know how utter was my weariness now i waked of a sudden and was very clear and refreshed and i crept to the mouth of the hole and lookt out but there was all a quietness round about and nothing to threaten and i found that i had slept ten hours so that i made a haste to eat and drink that i should go forward swiftly upon my journey and at that time as in the time when i did eat naked in the hollow by the fire hole i eat four of the tablets and this you shall understand to be rightly due unto me in that i had gone so long fasting in that my great journeying to come safe from the hound and to come past the house of silence and this shall seem but a little thing to you yet was it a wondrous important matter unto me that had gone so long with an empty belly and was never satisfied and neither should any be that had eat so little as i did eat and made to fill their belly always with a drink of water yet i doubt not but that it did keep my soul sweet and wholesome and no useful thing to the powers of evil of the land and when i had made an end of so great a gorging and had ceased to be drunken with water i gat my gear upon me and took the diskos into mine hand and so went forth once more towards the north and presently i was nigh unto the road again for it did curve something westward a space beyond and i was sore tempted to go upon the road for the ground was rough and the moss bushes did catch my feet yet did i stay among the bushes though the road was true and smooth by compare and by this telling you will perceive that i walked once more upright and had given over to crawl between the bushes and in truth this was so for the land did seem very quiet in all that part and i had less of fear now that i stood beyond the horrid unease of the house of silence now after that i had journeyed twelve hours i saw that i was come upon the commencement of a great and mighty slope as that the world did slope downward always towards the north and i went on again after that i had eat and drunk as i did likewise before this at the sixth hour of that day's journey and presently i perceived the road to cease and surely this did confound me as that a man of this age had come to a part where the world did end for you shall know that the road was that which had seemed to go on for ever and you shall mind the way of my life up till that time and so shall you the better conceive of my bewilderment and as it were a feeling of great strangeness unto one that was overprest as you would believe with strange matters yet truly was this all as the little book of metal had told unto me and so should i have been something prepared yet are we ever thus needing eye proof and perhaps it is more proper that it be so yet you shall perceive me adrift somewhat as to direction for i had steered before this time so that i should come to the north of the house of silence and afterward had shaped my way by the road but now was i adrift as it might be set down in the wilderness and so did i stand and consider and presently did look unto the far pyramid which was now a great way off in the night and had seemed but small by that which i knew it to be and lo as i did look i perceived that i could but see the high upper point of the light of the great pyramid where did shine the last light and i was confounded afresh yet in a moment i saw that the greatness of the slope did account for this but here i should tell to you that the slope was nowise steep but did seem as that it should never cease and mayhaps this is clear unto you and i perceived surely that the time was come when i should make an utter parting from the great redoubt and the thought came very heavy upon me and in the same time i knew that the aether was stirred by the emotions of the millions so that i had knowledge they watched me with the great spy glass and did send word down unto the hour slips and by this did the millions know and have a great thinking upon me in that moment and you shall perceive how utter lost and lonesome i did feel and it was at that time that i did test the compass to comfort me as i did tell before this and feared i must sure forget when i did come to the proper place yet have i minded me as i did desire and i saw now that the night land that i did wot of was hid from me by the slope and i turned and looked down the slope and surely all before me was utter wildness of a dark desolation for it did seem to go nowhither but into an everlasting night and there was no fire down there neither light of any kind but only darkness and as i did feel eternity and downward into that blackness did the great slope seem to go for ever now as i did stand there looking downward into the dark and often backward unto the shining of the final light and put to a horrid desolateness behold there came the low beating of the master word in the night and it did appear as that it had been sent to give me courage and strength in that moment and did seem unto my fancy that surely it did come upward unto me from out of the mighty blackness into which the great slope ran yet could this have been but a belief for the aether doth have no regard unto direction to show you whence the spiritual sound doth come and this did my knowledge and reason know full well and i made that i would send back the master word sending it with my brain elements and so give news unto naani how that i did struggle to come unto her yet did i have caution in time for in verity had i sent the master word then had the evil forces of the land wotted that i was out and mayhaps had come swift unto my destruction and so did i contain my spirit and desire and made to do wisely yet was i put in courage by the low beat of the master word and did listen very keen that some message should follow but there came none neither did the weak throb of the word come about me again at that time and because that i was now grown more to my natural state and did feel that i should indeed find the maid i looked once more unto the great pyramid long and eager and with a solemn heart yet with no sign or salutation as i was before determined and afterward i turned and went downward into the dark viii down the mighty slope now i went downward very quiet and slow into that darkness and did make but a cautious way for now you shall know me truly wrapped about with such a night as did seem to press upon my very soul and such as you shall never have seen nor felt so that i did seem lost even from my self and did appear as that i went presently in unreal fashion and did pass onward for ever and for ever through everlasting night so that odd whiles i did make to walk with random as that i stept no more upon this earth but did go offwards into the void yet was this foolishness of the mind set straight and proper each time that it did come about for lo i did kick against an upjutting rock here and fall upon a great and unseen boulder there and so was shaken very quickly to a sound knowledge that i trode the hard and actual earth and had no true dealings with unreal matters and ever i did go downward and by this only did i have a guide to my way yet as you shall think through reason of the utter dark i made scarce a mile in an hour or even two full hours and so grew bitter by reason of mine unableness to go forward with a proper and free stride but i did think me presently upon a thing that i should do to light my path and to this end i did make the diskos to spin odd whiles and did look down the mighty slope the little way that the strange glistening of the diskos did show and so fixed my path into mine inward remembering and would go forward afresh until that i was shaken once more by the darkness and would fain to look once again upon the blessedness of light and make me some knowledge of my way and truly the light from the diskos did seem astonishing great and this to be because there was so monstrous a darkness all about me there forever and thereafter would i go onward again until the pain of my stumblings did bid me surely to have that sweet shining once more unto my path and so shall you perceive my going and sore and miserable was it unto the heart and like to shake the courage of the spirit yet in verity i had come through much and did have intent to give way to no foolishness of thought and you shall well believe that i did make the light not more oft than i did surely need for it was no properness of wisdom to use the power of the diskos save for mine extremity now presently when i had done thiswise through six long and bitter hours and it being now beyond the twentieth hour since i did last slumber i sat me down there upon the mighty slope in the everlasting dark and did eat two of the tablets and made the water and could but feel and hearken whether i did this thing right and that and when i had eat and drunk i unfolded my cloak and wrapt it around me and placed the scrip and the pouch under my head and the diskos i took to company me and so fell swiftly upon sleep yet did think earnestly but vaguely upon naani as i came unto slumber and i slept all but six hours and did waken very sudden there in the utter dark and i got me to mine elbow and did listen very keen for i had waked immediately as that something had touched me or come nigh unto me and i gript the diskos and listened but there did not even a little sound come to me out of all that night and presently i had more assuredness that naught did make harm about me and i sat me up in the dark and reached for my scrip and did eat and drink there in that utter night and fumbled somewhat as you shall think yet i was done in a while and got my gear upon me and the diskos into my hand and so to my feet and forward now all that day i did have a strange unease of the spirit so that i stopt oft to listen as that my soul told of something nigh unto me that did follow very quiet yet did mine ears perceive nothing and so i alway to go downward again into the night that held the slope and here should i tell how that in the early part of the seventh hour after i had eat and drunk and went forward as ever upon my journey down the mighty slope i did have a very sore tumble against a sharp rock for i put my foot sudden into a small hole and this did make me to pitch and i was utter shaked by the fall and lay very quiet for a time for the rock had surely ript my body but for the armour and after that i was something renewed of strength and spirit i made that i should go no more upon my feet but upon my hands and knees and thus should i feel the way that i went and have a less need of the diskos which had not overmuch use to light my way in that i shone it not often and did guess more than i did perceive as you may think and so i crept all that day which was a bitter way of travel yet had i done many a sore mile thus through the night land and when that i had gone downward for eighteen hours and eat and drunk thrice i ceased from my labour and did feel about in the darkness that i come to a level place for my rest and so did find presently a place not so bad and did push and cast away such small boulders as had been like to irk me then did i eat and drink and afterward composed me to my sleep and had many a thought of naani as i did drift unto slumber yet also had i memories of the strange half fear that had been with me all that day as though something went constantly near me in the dark and because of this twice did i rise unto mine elbow and listen but heard no sound to trouble me and afterward did trust that i did but fancy and so came at last unto slumber that yet was not over restful for truly i did listen even as i slept and when i had been asleep scarce six hours i waked again very sudden as i had done before and had belief that something did be anigh unto me and i gript the diskos and did hearken yet was there no sound that mine ears did wot of neither aught that had power to be surely known of the spirit and all that day was as the day before save that about the eighth hour i came near to fall into some monstrous pit in the great slope but did only fall with my breast upon the edge and so drew back and presently did crawl all around it in the dark and come safe unto the lower side yet shaken and put more in trouble of spirit than before and fearful how i should go for i knew not whether i had come among such things or whether i had but few to sorrow me and so you shall perceive that i went over cautious for a great while in all that utter dark but did think at last upon a plan to go with more surety and speed but to this i did need a cord and surely i had no cord upon me and if a boy be no boy that hath none such about him shall not the same be said of any man and this i did think as i searched me for the sayings of that day had many that were like to this yet in the end i did compass my plan for i did buckle the scrip and the pouch together and took one of the straps from the pouch and this strap was long and thin and well suited unto my purpose then i fixt a stone into the end of the strap and buckled it there and after that i cast the stone before me as i went upon my hands and knees and i did hold to the hither end of the strap and so was abled to have something of knowledge whether there lay any great deepness immediately before me and thiswise to strive that i fall not down some monstrous cliff in the night and so did i go casting the stone continually to my front down the slope and this you shall think to be a cumbersome fashion of travel yet was i in better case than in all the time since i had begun to go downward of the mighty slope in the everlasting darkness and at the eighteenth hour i did sleep and was waked strangely before the sixth hour even as i had waked before and this did put always upon me a new wonder and unease yet did no harm seem to come unto me and i did strive that i have no needful trouble of mind but that something was always nigh unto me in the dark i do truly believe yet have i no knowing that it was evil for it harmed not me and three days more i journeyed thus and did never cease to creep downward weariful upon my hands and knees and the diskos i had to my hip and so shall you know how i carried it and by this as you do know i had been on the great slope six days of utter dark and did have no wotting but that i went unto some dire and dreadful place for surely i had gone for ever downward a monstrous way and here before i tell further i must set down how that the cold was much gone from out of the air upon the slope and the air was grown as it did seem very heavy unto my chest and concerning this matter i should say something for if i do mind me i have said not overmuch concerning the air of the night land and the mighty pyramid for truly i have been so set to tell my story of all that i did truly see and adventure upon yet though i have said but little you will surely have perceived that the air of that far and chill time was not as the air of this but was thin and keen within the night land and lay not as i do think to a great height above the land but only nigh to the earth and as you do know through my tellings there was a wondrous difference between the air within the mighty pyramid and that which lay without around the base for upward beyond that i did understand that there was no outward air that any should breathe and so was all the pyramid sealed in certain wise in all the upper cities for ever and whether it was sealed utterly from the outward air at the base i do not surely remember if in truth that i did ever bother my head to such matters yet if i be set proper in memory and understanding we did draw air from the underground fields but whether they gat any change or newness of air from the night land i have no knowledge and do lament that i have no sure knowing yet as you shall believe i could surely write an hundred books upon that wonder of the future and be still lacking in the half of all that there is to be told and so do i try to have courage to this my task and to have no over trouble because that i do tell but a little of a great tale and here in this place will i set down how that the peoples of the pyramid were greater to the chest methinks than we of this age but yet do i have no oversurety in the matter for well it may be that the reason of this age doth blind within me somewhat the knowledge that i have concerning that for in verity is it not but a natural thing to believe those peoples to be great of the chest so that they should make a proper dealing with the thin air of that place and that time and yet as i do strive to make plain unto you because that this thing should be by the making of my reason i do the more distrust that reason shall make foolish my knowledge for even a fool should suppose that which i have told and the truth may be even otherwise yet that the peoples of the upper cities had great chests i do well know for this was a common knowledge even as we of this age do acknowledge the peoples of africa to be of blackness or those of patagonia to be of great stature and by this one thing should any know a man of the upper cities from a man of the lower cities and because that there grew this difference among the peoples there had been once as any could learn from the histories a plan whereby the peoples should be moved upward and downward through the great height of the mighty pyramid from this city unto that yet had it met with great disfavour and was put out of force and this is easy to be seen as the natural way of the human heart and here it doth occur unto me that it was like enough to be a plan for health beside of training of the mind that each youth and maid was put to travel through all the cities of the mighty pyramid the which did take three years and two hundred and twenty five days as i have told before this for by this plan were they made to breathe the air of every height and this mayhaps unto the good of their developing and they also to discover that air which was best to their need and concerning the air of the night land you shall know that there was in all that land no flying thing because that the air was grown very thin yet as the records did show there had once been monstrous flying brutes that went over the land in mighty bounds but this was in a long gone age and we could but suppose that the records gave truth and here you shall know that when the monstruwacans did learn that i would journey through the night land in search of naani there had been some foolish and well intended talk among them that i take a small flying ship that was in the great museum beside the models of the great ships for truly this machine was yet sound to go for it was made of the grey metal of the mighty pyramid that did seem to have no power to cease yet in verity i had no skill to manage this neither had it flown through an hundred thousand years so that none did know the mastership of that art which did be learned but by a constant practice and oft made uneasy by fallings that did wreck the machine as i did know from the book of flying and moreover as i have told the air of the night land was grown over weak to uphold such a thing which i doubt not had made the peoples of the pyramid to cease from flyings quite so much as that they did fear the forces of evil in the night and if that there had been air and skill sufficient unto this purpose of flying yet had i been wicked with foolishness that i should work to be hung upward in the night for all the evil of the night land to behold and though i had gone up some great way yet the machine had surely made a great noise in the quietness of the eternal night as you shall suppose now indeed am i gone weary that i should need to tell so much concerning the air of that time and place for surely i do seem to make this my story as that i did make a lecturing upon matters of chemistry and so do i cast about that i may not bother to tell more upon this matter yet in truth a little more of my thinkings and observings had i better set down here and so be done with it but you shall have patience with me and know that had this my story been no more than an idle tale i had been free to make no labour with such matters now there doth a wonder come to me why that the road makers who were of that far off age which was before the age of the mighty pyramid did not fly downward from the upper world into the deep of the monstrous valley but did instead build a road yet it may be that the air of the upper world had grown thin a great age so that they had truly forgot that once man did have power to fly but even if that they did have proper machines to this purpose surely it were a wondrous and fearful thing to fly downward an hundred great miles for they surely to have a dread that they never to rise again through so huge a deep and moreover the downward world that was the bottom of the great valley was full of monsters as was told in the little metal book and the monsters were very strange and unknown and foreign to the whole world that had never come unto the deep of the valley and the valley had come as you shall mind when the earth did split and this thing was in truth like to be thought that same ending of the world which all nations have been taught to believe shall come for in verity when the world did split and burst and the oceans rushed downward into the earth and there was fire and storms and a mighty chaos surely it was proper to think that the end had come yet was it in truth but the beginning of hope of a new eternity of life so that out of the end came the beginning and life out of death and good out of that which did seem a dire matter and so is it always yet doth this go past my first wonder which did concern the wherefore that they made not to descend in things of flight yet maybe shall my reasons stand to show why this was not and again mayhap it did chance that some were wild adventurers and did leap over the edge of the upper world having to ease their flight certain contrivings like to parachutes and these you shall picture as that you watched them to leap and so shall you see them go downward into the gloom and you shall see them for maybe ten miles and maybe for twenty miles and afterward shall they be lost utterly in that great deep and seen no more of any man for ever but when the nations became road makers and came downward slowly to the monstrous deep of the mighty valley that did split the world then were they come there by millions and with power sufficient to fight against the beasts and afterward to grow back again to an ancient civilizing and so to the building of the great airships that were yet shown in the great museum of the pyramid and here shall i cease from these my thinkings on this matter for indeed who shall say what did be truly a reason for those peoples and what was their need and so do i come to no surety by my wonderings yet as you do know all things do seem verily to go in a circle for behold in time they of the mighty pyramid were likewise held off from the glory of the airships and so were gone backward a great way according as we do look upon this matter and so hath this been the way always as you shall know who have studied and thought and seen the true ways and goings of life and now will i go forward in my telling and here will set down a sure thing that i did perceive both by mine ears and by my fingers for as i did make clear to you but a while gone there had come a change into the air as i did go downward of the mighty slope and truly i was come to a great and new deepness even beyond that of the wondrous depth where did stand the last redoubt so that i was afar down and in a monstrous night and the air here was of a great thickness and abundancy even as it might be the air of this our age or maybe more or maybe less for who may compare two matters with a sure guessing that do have an eternity to keep them asunder and because that the air was grown very strong and apparent it shall be mayhaps that it was by reason of this thing that the water when i did make it did fizz upward in a moment very loud and plentiful and did boil overward to the earth from out of the cup and wet upon my hand and surely this thought did come very keen to my reason as i did fumble each time of mine eating there in the everlasting night and lonesomeness of the great slope and so shall you have knowledge now of this and that thing which did come upon my thought and of the little and the big wonders and all shall help something to give unto you the ache of newness and bewilderment that was constant companion unto me now by this time as i have said i was gone downward ever for six great days and i did seem as that i should presently come to the middle of the world for of going downward there was no end and then when it did be that i was near ready to believe this i perceived far off in the deep of the night a little shining that was yet weak and unsure and i do not know whether i can truly give unto you the great astonishment and pain of hope that did come upon me so that i grew sick in all my being but to behold once again the blessedness of light and to have help unto my belief that i went not downward to an utter desolation and i stood upward from my knees and did look very earnest and surely it did seem that a light was there afar downward in the night and again it did seem that i must be plagued by my hopes and by my fancy and that there was nowhere any light and then again i did see it very clear and not to be mistaken and i had a shaking to come upon me and i gat me to a run and made a great and mad speed down the dark slope and lo i was not gone any way but i went headlong and near brake myself and could but hold my teeth together very fierce and quiet until that the pain was something gone from me and afterward i gat me again to mine hands and knees and went slowly as before and so for a great hour or more and did look oft and alway the light became more plain to my sight but ever to come and go oddly wise yet did i go six hours before that i was come anywise near to it and by this shall you know how great a space off it had been and lo when that i did seem surely anigh unto it truly was it still far away in the night and i came not indeed near to it until that i was gone onward again for three hours more and all that time did i yet go downward into the night but the slope now did not be so utter dark now presently i made a pause and stood upward to my feet so that i should the better perceive the light and lo as i did look toward it i heard a faraway sound in the dark as that something did set up a strange and monstrous piping in the night and immediately i went to mine hands and knees among the stones of the slope and kept myself low in the darkness so that i should be the less plain to be seen did any monster approach but there came nothing to trouble me and i went downward of the slope for yet another hour and all the time that i did go the sound of the piping grew more in the great eternity of the night upon the slope and by this time was i come truly near unto the light but yet did not behold it plainly for it did burn beyond certain monstrous rocks that stood between and i went to the left for maybe the half of a big mile and all the while that i did go the piping made a mightier whistling in the night and it did seem presently as that the earth sent forth the sound and revelry of wild roarings and i went the more silent and later did kneel among three rocks and peered forth for a while upon the place before me and now being come nigh unto the light though yet it was not unhid from behind the great barriers of the uprising rocks i perceived that i crouched within the mouth of a mighty gorge and the left side was a great way off and i saw it plain at whiles when the light did rise but the light was to the right and it was so wondrous great that it did make clear to me that a mountain was to that side of the gorge and went upward into the everlasting night as it did seem for ever and afar down the gorge i did see the shinings of strange fires faint and a great way off and so was i come at last to the bottom of the mighty slope yet the gorge also to go downward but not so great and presently i did go forward again and so did open the point of the rocks as the sailors do say and i saw now that there gushed forth a great blue flame from the earth and the mighty rocks stood about it as that they were olden giants groupt there to some strange service and concerning this flame i was not overmuch astonished in my reason for it had seemed to me as i drew anigh that the fire and the sound should be made by the roaring and whistling of a burning gas that did issue forth among the rocks yet truly though it did be a natural matter it was yet a wondrous sight and set amazement on my senses for the flame did dance and sway whitherward monstrously and sometimes did seem that it dropt so low as an hundred feet and afterward went upward with a vast roaring unto the utter height and did stand mighty and blazing maybe a full thousand feet so that the far side of the gorge was lit and surely it was seven great miles off or more but yet did show plain and wondrous and the light did show me the flank of the mountain that made the right hand side of the gorge to go up measureless into the night and so shall you perceive that i stayed awhile among the rocks that were in the mouth of the gorge that i should gaze upon this thing but afterward i lookt this way and that way so that i should have a knowing of the place where i was come and it was a wild and stark and empty place as you must perceive and the far side did be great miles off as i did say and everywhere there was abundance of rock and lonesomeness and before me there went the great and dim length of the gorge and there were lights here and lights there in a great distance and oft as it did seem the quiet dancing of lights in diverse places but yet were these gone on the instant and ever there was a strong and vacant silence upon that place and presently after that i had looked once more unto the mighty dancing flame and perceived nowhere any life around it i went onward down the quiet gorge and for a great way as i journeyed was my path lit by the dancing of the blue flame and oft should i seem to be going but dimly among the rocks and my shadow faint and long and lo the flame would leap and all the gorge come to a wondrous brightness and my figure to shorten and the shadows to be black and strong and so shall you perceive how i went and oft did i turn me about to behold the dancing of the great light for it was solemn to my spirit even amid so much of greatness and eternity to think upon that flame and to conceive that it had an utter age danced there at the foot of the mighty slope unseen through lonesome eternities and this i do tell unto you that thereby may you have some knowledge of the strangeness and the bitter loneliness of that place which in verity did seem the expressing of all the lonesomeness of my wanderings and all the time as i did go downward of the great gorge there sounded the blast of the roaring that was presently afar to my back and the mountain sides did catch it here and in that place and sent it offwards with strange and improper echoings as of a chill piping or oddwise as hushed whisperings of monstrous creatures so that i did oft stoop to hide a little among the boulders for truly i knew not but that some unnatural thing called from the darkness of the mountain side and for six hours i walked onward thus and sometimes did hide having a sudden fear as i have told and presently in a great while the roaring was sunk to a far and monstrous piping but in the end to no more than a far and uncertain whistling that yet did catch strange echoes in the night and in the end there was only a quietness and yet as you do perceive there had been always a silence in that gorge as i have told and this to the despite of the whistling and i do hope that you have understanding with me in this matter for it was truly as i have told and there is no contrariness of telling in this matter now in all this time that i had walked in the great gorge i had past four of the far lights that i did see from the bottom of the slope and the two first and the fourth were blue but the third was green and all did dance and quake and sent fitful shinings into the belly of the gorge and there came also from them whistlings and from the second one a low and strange moaning noise and i doubted not the gas did come oddly and with trouble and i past these things with no great thought for truly they were no matters for notice after that which i had beheld now as you shall mind it was surely in the early third of the seventh day of my journey down the mighty slope that i saw the first shining of the monstrous gas fountain and from that time until now had there past maybe sixteen hours and as you do wot i had eat not in all my travel since that i had seen the light so that i was gone to a proper lack inward and moreover it was full nineteen hours or more since that i had slept and all that while had i laboured and i ceased me from wandering and lookt about that i should come to a safe and proper place for my slumber and this i saw very quick for there was dry stone and rock everywhere and no failing of holes and diverse places to my purpose so that i was soon in a little cave between two mighty boulders and here i eat four of the tablets for truly so many were my due and i had not been violent had i eat more and afterward i made some of the water and it did fizz up in a moment so that i perceived that but a good pinch made a great cup full and this i set to the count of the strong and heavy air as i have told which i did think to have a greater power of chemistry and presently i slept having my gear about me as ever and the diskos to my breast and as i went into slumber i thought sweetly upon naani as i had done indeed an hundred times since i was come to the hopefulness of the lights of the gorge now whilst i slept i dreamed that the master word did presently beat all about me in the night yet as i do mind i waked not and because that i continued to sleep i have no sure knowing whether this was truly a dream or an happening and i minded me upon it when i waked but this was after that i had slept seven hours and i could have no sureness anywise of the matter but only that i was come safe through my sleep though heavy within my head and limbs as that the air did call me unto a further slumbering as is like enough and after that i had eat and drunk i put my gear about me and the diskos to my hip for i needed both my hands to the task of journeying amid the great boulders and i set forth again down the half light of the mighty gorge and through eighteen hours i made a strong going save when i did pause at the sixth and the twelfth hours to mine eating and by the eighteenth hour was come i was very ready to my food and slumber and presently i was asleep in a place of the rocks and that day had i past three and twenty of the dancing gas fires and five been like a white fire but the others blue and green and all did dance and made a strange and uncertain light within the great gorge yet was it a peaceful thing unto my spirit that there was truly light as you shall understand and i slept six hours and waked and did want more sleep as you shall think but i eat and drunk and put my gear upon me and went on downward of the gorge and at the sixth hour after that i had eat and drunk i came to a part where the big gas fires did cease to dance and there was a certain darkness upon that place yet was it not a proper dark for there came the glimmer of a flame here and the glimmer of a flame there as that little flames came upward between the stones and did vanish and come upward in another part and so did light and die out constant and forever amid the stones and the boulders of that lonesome gorge and made a low spread light so that it did seem unto me that strange shudders of light beat upward through the dark of that place and i went onward and a heavy fume did seem to hang in the air and horrid gases to come upward from the earth in odd puffings and anon a light would leap upward beyond the next stone and afterward vanish and there would be an hundred thousand such upon every hand running to and fore and afterward for a moment an utter dark and again the little flames everywhere so that it did seem i went one moment amid the heart of a strange country of fire and immediately through a country of utter night and this was to me strange and a peculiar matter yet as i do think the gases did bother me the more for they did seem as that they were like to hurt mine health utterly for in verity oft did i seem as that i should choke and breathe no more by reason of the poison that came upward from among the stones and the boulders and all that time as they came or went did the little flames make small phlocks of sound in the gorge as they did flash or die and the sounds did seem to my likening as stones cast into an utter silent pool for they but made apparent the everlasting quiet of the gorge and afterward i came beyond this place and you shall see me going very lonesome among the rocks of the gorge beyond and by this it was come nigh unto the eighteenth hour and i did find a place proper to my slumber and did eat and drink and was quickly gone over unto sleep and here i should tell how that i had not an over fear of evil powers whilst i was in the great gorge for truly it did seem as that nothing that ever did live came anigh to that wild and silent place of stone and rock but that i journeyed through it alone and was surely the first that did go that way for maybe a million years and this feeling that was upon me i do hope you to perceive and take unto yourselves and thus have an understanding of my heart at that time and as you shall know i went always unto slumber with sweet and with troubled thoughts of the maid yet for a great while i had been put so mightily to the labour of my way that my heart did suffer less at this time than should be thought and truly it doth show me how i was drawn unto that one with all my being that i did surely think so oft and sweetly upon her amid so many perils and matters of horror and this doth seem something strange to say when that you do consider that i was adventured unto these same perils and horrors but only for the sake of the maid and in six hours did i wake as i did strive alway to set myself to do yet was i very heavy and slow for a little until that i was more properly come to wakefulness and surely as i did think before this was like to be put upon me by the weighty air of the place but yet it might be that the gas which did float in the gorge was upon my lungs and also as you have perceived if but you have attended my way the air was grown warm and oft were the rocks pleasant to the seat and all of these matters did contrive to make me slumbrous now presently the gas fires did cease utterly in the gorge and i lookt downward along that great place and saw only a greyness but above the greyness there was as it did seem something of a vague and ruddy shining in the night and this did wake me to wonder what new thing lay before so that i grew more eager among the boulders and later when i had eat at the sixth and the twelfth hours and gone on awhile i came to a place where the gorge made a quick turning unto my left and at the end of the turning was a red and glowing light that was very great and wonderful so that i was utter keen to come to that place that i should discover what made the shining and the place where i was come then was very dark because that i was nigh under the mighty wall of the mountain of the right side of the gorge yet above as it did seem to me there was a far red upward glowing in the night then did i go forward very fast and presently in a good while i discovered that i drew near to a second great turning that went to the right and about the seventeenth hour i came nigh unto the second great turning and here did i put caution upon me and crept for a while among the dark rocks of that place that i should come to a sight of that which made the monstrous red shining and presently i was beyond the corner of the mountain and did look downward into a mighty country of seas and the burning of great volcanoes and the volcanoes did seem as that they burned in the seas and the country was full of a great ruddy light from the volcanoes and so shall you perceive me there among the rocks that did all stand upward strange and bold and silent in the red and monstrous glare of the light and i as it did seem the one thing of life in all that desolation and eternity of rock and stone there in the end part of the great gorge and i peered forth into the wonder of the light and was full of thrillings and fancies that i was surely come to the place where the lesser redoubt had been builded and immediately i knew that this was not so for surer had not naani told how that they were in a land of darkness and if this did be so truly how wondrous and dread a way had i yet to go if that this country of seas and mighty volcanoes stood between surely it did seem to me then as that i must wander searching unto the world's end and so shall you be company unto me there with my trouble and my thoughts and the immediate wonder and strange glory of that mighty country ix the dark pyramid now in two hours more i was come clear down out of the gorge and stood in that country and for all that i did feel fresh troubled and bewildered yet was i rejoiceful as you may believe in the surprising light and splendour of that sudden land and before that i had come down out of the great gorge i had stood high within the mouth thereof and lookt well out over the mighty country and i had counted seven and twenty great volcanoes and this doth not take heed of two monstrous ranges of fire hills that burned afar off something unto my right neither doth it take account of an hundred thousand lesser places of fire and truly it did seem a very land of fire and water for there was a small fire hill stood within a sea as it did seem no more than a little mile from that place where i did stand and maybe a score to the back of it spread all about and here shall i do proper to tell concerning the seas for there were of these that i did count at that time three that were small and a mighty sea that went onward for ever into the red light of the fire hills so that it was gone utterly out of my sight and did show no ending and there rose up out of the seas islands and on the islands volcanoes but in other parts the fire hills did come upward straightly from the sea and over the near sea as it did seem there lay a plentitude of steam as that the sea did boil at whiles and in diverse places and there did seem to me as it were within the red atmosphere of that place as that there were a muttering thunder low and constant shaking the air now from that distance and now from this and this did i judge to be the voices of the fire hills speaking with the fire that lived in them and you shall conceive how utter new was all this unto me for there was in that country a constant voice of the energy of life so that the world noise of this our age was even there again and with a keen and undoubted apparentness and the more so some ways than now and here shall i set down more closely the things that were ready to my gaze and first that it did much attract me there was a huge and blackened mountain unto the left of the mouth of the gorge and the mountain did go upward into the night maybe fifteen and maybe twenty miles and there was a mighty peaked volcano that grew out from the side of the mountain so high up as five miles as i did guess that height and this was upon the far side and above this there was a second maybe nine or ten great miles up in the blackness of the night that hung afar upward and as that this were not great wonder enough there did burn and glow two other mighty fire hills at an utter height upon the left crest of that black mountain and these were upward so monstrous a way as that they did seem to make strange and smouldering suns within the night and truly as you shall perceive this was a wondrous thing and below these upward fire hills there rose up from the earth vast mountains of ash and burned stuff that had been cast forth by these perched volcanoes and had poured downward unto the earth throughout eternity and so to build grey and sombre monuments unto the dreadful glory of time and to my right there was always sea and sea and the red blazing of the fire hills but unto my left there were mighty forests and there rose upward here and in that place as that they were beyond the great woods monstrous fire hills and so do you take from me something of that first impressing upon my brain and sense and after that i had come down out of the mouth of the great gorge as i did tell a little while gone i came upon a pause for surely which way was the way proper unto my search and i lookt about for a great while and afterward did climb back into the gorge and called myself foolish that i had not thought to map my way ere i came down and when i was come up into the gorge again lo i saw that there was but one way that i should go for truly as i have said there was only the seas unto my right but unto the left where the shores did meet the seas there seemed so far as mine eyes did tell to me a clear way for a space and mayhap when i had come so far i should even find a further way to go forward and so did i descend again unto the country of the seas as i did ever call that red shining country of water and fire and by that i was come again from the height of the gorge it was four and twenty hours since that i did last sleep so that i was fain that i should put into some nook and come to slumber as you shall well believe and i found me a neat and proper place where three great trees grew about a little basin of rock that was very dry and warm and here after that i had eat three of the tablets and drunk some of the water the while that my belly did yearn as ever for proper eating stuff i made my bed in the little basin of the rock and lay me down and did begin to think awhile upon naani but was gone over to sleep before that i was aware and lo i was suddenly awake and did find that i swam in a hot water and a mercy i did think was it that i was not drowned as i did sleep and i gat me to my feet and the basin was full of water hot and steaming and pungent to the taste as well i did know and i perceived now that the water poured in from a smoothed slit upon the far side and did come with a strange gurgling and bubbling so that i conceived some deep well to boil and thus to drive upward this water into the basin and glad was i that it did not boil as it came forth and surely now that i was upon the dry land and did consider i did quickly suppose that the water had poured forth at seasons into the basin for an eternity of time and afterward did go back by fissures in the bottom of the basin and this to happen as i soon did find a little beyond the length of every hour and indeed the basin to empty slow as i did watch now being much wetted i stript off mine armour having before this dipt out mine effects from the hot pool and so did come down to the naked flesh and i found a place where the rock was hot and here i did spread my garments and whilst that they came to dryness i gat me into the hot pool and had a very pleasant bathing and did have no great fear of any dangerous thing for as it did seem i had surely left all such behind within the night lands yet did i have the diskos upon the pool edge to my hand for i had no proper assurance in this matter yet as it did prove there were many monstrous beasts in that country but never did i feel the nearness and horrid power of any evil force for these as i do conceive were congregate and gathered about the mighty pyramid being attracted thereto by the great spiritual essence of so wondrous a multitude of humans gotten so close in one spot even as sharks do come after the ship that hath bullocks within yet how that the evil powers were given entrance unto this state of our life i have no sure knowing yet have i put forward certain thoughts on this matter in an earlier place and more than such thinkings is surely vanity for there is no certainty in my reasoning concerning the thing now presently was my clothing dry yet before this i had come out from that bath which truly was nigh all gone backward into the earth and i dressed me again and got my armour upon me and afterward was i in a more lightsome state of the mind and yet very ready to come again unto my sleep and this i did and had six hours more beside the pool and once was wakened somewhat by the gruntling and bubbling noise of the water that was made as the pool did fill time and again and when the six hours were gone i waked very well fitted in my senses and feelings to go forward again through that red lighted country and this i did after that i had eat and drunk now all that day i went forward at a great pace and the nameless woods were unto my left and the shores of the seas unto my right and oft did i find that the trees grew even into the water so that oft did i go forward among the trees and a very wonderful thing was this to me that never had known before in all my life until i was come into that country how that a glad and wild mystery doth live among forest trees for there was no such strange wildness among the groves of the underground fields though a solemn beauty in plenty and the scent of the woods was sweet unto my spirit as you shall wot now all the time that i did go there was the shore unto my right but alway to my left and around me oft times as i did say the great forests and as i did go lo there was life in all those darksome woods and living eyes did peer out odd whiles upon me and afterward go backward into the dark so that i wotted not whether to fear or to have no heed of trouble yet naught did come anigh to me to make any hurt and thrice in that day did i come to little fire hills that burnt redly and sent out fire and noise so that i heard their trouble each time through the forest before that i was come to them and about each was there a deadness and desolation where the fire had killed the big trees yet as i did observe the quick life of little plants did grow more nigh as that they were born and lived between the times of the fire bursts and this i do take it that you perceive and in that one day i past thirty and seven boiling springs but whether they boiled truly i do have no knowledge only that they sent out a great steam oft times and some did make a strong roaring noise so that to hear them afar off in the forests was to think odd times that some wild beast roared strangely now when the eighteenth hour was come i sat me down as i had done upon the sixth and the twelfth hours and eat two of the tablets and drank some of the water which here did fizz very rich and quick and afterward i lay down to my slumber for i was greatly wearied and i had chosen a place against a great rock which was so that no creature might come upon me from behind and i came easy upon sleep but yet i did fix it upon me that i slumber only with the body for i did know by the shining of the eyes in the darksome woods that strange creatures abode in the mighty forests and ere i was gone over to sleep i thought upon naani as i had done much all that day as though her spirit did hover near unto mine and did strive pitiful to speak with me and this i set out to you that you shall know how it did seem unto me in my thoughts and fancyings and as i lay there i put a blessing upon her and a determination into my heart that i make a more desperate speed of my going if that might be so that i come the sooner to that strange and unknown place in the dead world where did stand the lesser refuge and i was then asleep in a moment and lo sudden i was awake and lovely was the brightness of that country that did show me in a moment my danger and did not keep me suspend in fearful doubt as did the grey darkness and strange shadows and lights of the night land for i saw on the instant that i got me to mine elbow how that certain things did crouch within the borders of the trees no more than a score paces off and i perceived in a moment that my spirit had been given knowledge and had wakened me and i stared the while that i did grip the diskos and i saw that there were six squat men that were humpt at the neck and shoulder and they did crouch all there in a row and were something hid by the shadows and i perceived that they watched me and the eyes of the men did shine like the eyes of beasts and so shall you know somewhat of the strange terror that came upon me yet had i the diskos and mine armour and though my heart did shake a little yet was my spirit assured to conquer now i gat me to my feet and had the diskos ready within my hand and behold i could not see the humped men for they were gone from that place yet never did i see them go though i had kept my gaze very steadfast upon that part where they did hide and as you shall understand i was near ready to believe that there had been nothing there within the border of the wood yet truly i knew that the men with the humps had been there as i had seen now i looked presently and found that i had slept five hours and i eat two of the tablets as i did stand there watchful and afterward drank some of the water and so was ready to go forward again for i was grown very anxious to be gone from that place and did have no knowledge but that those strangely humpt men were but a little way off among the trees and might come upon me in a moment or further that they did go to call an army of other humped men to my destruction and after that i was ready and had my gear secure upon me i set off at a great stride and did hold the diskos very handy and lookt this way and lookt that way and all the while made onward with speed for truly i was grown so lean and hard that it did seem to me that i had power to out pace those men or aught else of their kind and all that day through thirty great hours did i go forward at that stride and did always watch and at every sixth hour i eat two of the tablets and drank a little of the water and went onward again and so did i hope that i was lost from those humped men yet though i did hope my faith was not this wise for twice and thrice did it come to me that there went things through the woods to my left all that day and did keep always to a level with my speed yet were always hid and as you shall believe this did be a very shaking thing to my heart and did make my hope of but little account now because that i had no faith to company my hope i was not easy to have slumber until that i was come to a place proper and safe and so as i have told i went onward through thirty great hours and in truth in all that while i did find nowhere that did seem to fit my need and lo about the end of the thirtieth hour i perceived that there was water ahead besides the water of the sea that was ever to my right and i thought maybe that the sea did go inward at that part of the land but it was otherwise for when i was gotten to that place i found that a river came into the sea and did come out of all the country that lay unto my left and in the mouth of this river there was a small island and surely i did look across to the island and think it a refuge from the humped men that did surely play dog upon my going yet truly this was but an idle thought and my need was that i should come to some way to cross over the river that i go forward beside the great sea which did stretch onward as it did seem for ever before me upon the far side and i knew not how to go across for i had no power to swim and had i swum there were surely monsters in that great and warm flowing river as you shall believe and i went upward of the river bank that i might come to some place where the river did narrow and surely i had been like to walk a mighty distance to this purpose but that i came soon to a second river that did enter the first not a mile above the shore of the sea so that as you do perceive there was the sea to one side of me and this second river unto the other and the first river before me and thus was i sorely perplexed as any had been truly that was in a like trouble yet as it did chance the need to go forward and the danger of the humped men put wit into me so that i lookt about for a tree that was fallen and there were many yet great so that i was much wearied and something strained of the spirit before that i gat two little trees unto the water now when this was done i made me a rough pole of a young tree plant and afterward i lashed the two trees together with my belts and straps and so had somewhat of a raft and you shall picture that all the time as i did go about this business i was very heedful lest the humped men should come upon me ere that i was gone free upon the water and this constant heeding did double the labour of my work as you shall perceive yet in the end it was done and i ready to adventure over the river and so i did push off with the pole and i pusht and paddled maybe the half of an hour for indeed it was all a clumsy contriving and mayhap i the more so in my labours yet presently i was come so far over that i drew nigh to the island and it did seem a wise and proper thing that i should have my slumber there and afterward go onward to the farther shore and this i did and after that i had eat and drunk as ever i lay down to sleep and by this time it was three and thirty hours since last i did slumber so that i was bitterly awearied and i had a great and restful sleep for truly the island did seem a very safe place and in verity i came to no harm though i was as a dead man for nine great hours and so shall you perceive my weariness and when i was come proper awake i eat two of the tablets and drank some of the water and afterward made an end of my voyage and then did take back my belts and straps from binding the trees and so forward again upon my way and no more fearful of the humped men for surely i did think i had left them all upon the far shore of the river though afterward i minded me that they might grow likewise upon the two sides but yet was i only discovered by those upon the one as you do know and all that day i went very swift and past many strange matters and did coast upon wonders oft and at the sixth and the twelfth hours did i eat and drink as ever and between the eighth and the fourteenth hours did i come past two mighty fire hills that made all the country to tremble with their noise and four times did monstrous creatures pass by me but i was swift hid and came to no harm and oft as i did go were my thoughts upon the dear maid that i journeyed to save from destruction yet as you must see always were my thinkings brought sharply unto my going so that scarce was i ever set off to ponder upon naani but that there came some danger or wonder to give me heed to my way and because of this as you have learned i was more put to plan free of the instant trouble and peril of my way through all that mighty journey than to have quiet chance for thoughts of love unto mine own yet truly was not my journey one whole thought of love unto naani and that peril made oft dumb my brain was but the truer song unto my maid and at times i was among trees but oft did go past unnumbered boiling springs and small fire hills and oft was the air full of the noise of the little fire hills and the roar of the boiling springs but there came no harm unto me and a thousand times did i perceive things that had life and i made a very cautious way though with a great speed and cleverness of going that made my heart glad and oft did i come to parts where a great life held the trees and green stuff did flourish exceedingly and the air rich and full and wondrous sweet so that i was fain to think how that in some far off time it might be that our children's children should come down unto this country when the upper valley of the night land was grown to an utter chill and lacking of air and here build them a new refuge if indeed any should come clear of the evil forces and the monsters that did live about the mighty pyramid in the night land yet how should they come clear of those things so that this is as you do perceive no more than a thought that did rise vaguely in me and yet again who shall say what may be and onward i did pass and i do mind me how that i saw the lower fires of that country to burn very fierce and this i set to the richness of the air but yet with no surety of knowledge and do but tell the same that you shall see the oddments of thought that went oft across my brain and so have so much knowledge as i concerning this and that now a little before the eighteenth hour was come i came out from among the trees and the sea was downward of a great cliff unto my right for i had gone upward for a long and weary hour and i did see now a thing that made me to be cautious and yet that did hold my heart to go swiftly to perceive the thing for it was very strange and i went forward quickly yet with a wise care and so was come presently more nigh and i perceived that the thing was in part a high rock very tall and pointed and maybe an hundred feet high but afterward i did find it to be more and there was a monstrous great thing upon the top of the rock that did seem very strange and i stopt and lookt and afterward went forward again and so for a time until that i was but a little way off and now i saw that there did seem to be a mighty long rock laid across the topmost part of the upstanding rock and yet had a very strange and shapely appearance and did seem upon the underpart to be as that i had lookt before upon it and upon the upper part there grew trees and green things even as these did grow upon odd ledges of the upstanding rock yet for the most the rock was very stark as that a blast had blown upon it and made it bare now when i had lookt for a while i bethought me that this should be a safe and proper place for my slumber if that i had power to come safe to the top and when i had thought this thing i began at once to climb up the rock and i found that the rock was very high so that in a while i was come a great way off the earth and yet was not come to the top of the rock and because that i was awearied i lookt about for a safe place to mine hand and lo there was a shelf of the rock very nigh that went inward a little to the side and i gat me to this ledge and did eat and drink and presently i slept and scarce had thought of naani in the moment of my slumbering for a great weariness was upon me the which i do think to have come by reason that i was not yet proper rested from the task of the day that was gone before that one now i waked very sudden maybe seven hours after and i had knowledge within me that my spirit did wot of some nigh danger and i gat upward from the rock very quiet and had the diskos ready in my hand and i lookt swift about me in the moment that i did wake yet did see nothing for there was naught on the ledge with me and i crept to the edge and lookt downward and lo i did see that there came up the rock two humped men and they did climb very swift and silent and i perceived that they smelled me and came to destroy me and i made ready the diskos to do battle and ceased not to look downward and i saw how that the humped men did seem to be humpt by reason of their being so monstrous thick and mighty of the neck and the shoulder as that they had been human bulls and i saw that they were very strong and by the speed of their climbing i knew they were swift and so did i make steady my attention and my heart to the saving of my life for truly i did know that i should be dead in a little or they now i stept back a space from the edge of the rock and had the diskos very ready for it was needful that i should kill one of those brute men speedy that i have no danger that one take me in the back whilst that i fight with the other then in a moment it did seem there came upward of the rock edge the great and brutish face of the man and in that moment that i slew him i did note curiously how that he had large teeth upon each side of the mouth and was aware that he had come so quiet as a great cat and in the backward parts of my brain i bethought that even thus maybe was primal man so that a strange and secondary questioning and wondering did live in that part of me and i did learn from these scarce conscious reasonings that i was of belief the thing was truly a man but very crude and dangerous and surely it is strange that i had all this thought in that little moment but in verity so it was though i doubt not but i bettered it with after thoughts when a while had gone now the first man died ere his great haired breast was come upward over the rock and he sank back and sagged and fell dully and i heard him bodge downward from rock to rock very lumbersome and so in a moment was silence then did i look this way and that way of the ledge for the second humpt man was not yet upon me and i feared that the pause did mean a cunning mischief and strategy and when a little time had past and all the while i was ready with the diskos and naught did come upward to harm me i stept very soft to the edge of the rock ledge and lookt downward but there was nowhere any thing to see now for a little moment i did think that the brutish man had run off being feared by the death that i did deal unto the first yet i put this from me at once for i did wot that such a creature did not be like to fear in such wise but was rather set to some horrid cunning of attack as i did fear and was somewhere below me among the holes of the great rock then i did think sudden that he might be gone upward so that he should come down upon my back and i lookt upward of the mighty rock but did see naught and afterward i stoopt forward a great way beyond the edge so that i should perceive whether the man did hide beneath and behold he was there below me and crouched under the rock shelf ready to his spring and in that moment he made unto me with so mighty a leap as any tiger should give and he came half over the edge and gript the diskos by the handle in an instant and surely i had lost that trusted weapon or been pulled over and cast into the depth but that the diskos did spin and the earth current did make live the handle as was intended save where the grip was set and lo the man gave loose the handle very swift for it had burned and shaken the creature sore and i staggered back with the effort i had made to withhold the diskos and the brutish man came upward again over the rock edge and leapt at me yet he gat me not for i sprang unto my right and made a blow with the diskos even as i did leap and the blow came something short but yet harmed the humpt man with a gash upon the belly very sore and horrid among the great brown hairs of the man and immediately he sprang after me but i smote full at the face so that he leaped back from the strange roar and blaze of the diskos and yet was harmed for he gat not right free of the blow but did be cut very sore on the mighty and haired arm now seeing that he was something feared of the weapon i ran in upon him and smote again at the face yet was the man gone out of my reach before that the blow did reach for truly he was quick as a panther and immediately he did leap unto the ending of the ledge where it did join upon the rock and he caught the living rock between his two hands and truly the rock must have been splitten there for he tore out a monstrous lump so great near as my body and did run upon me with the rock above the head of him now i perceived i should be smashed in a moment if that i did not slay the man very quick for so mighty was he that he did leap this way and that way after me as though the great rock did cumber him no more than it had been but a light matter and you shall perceive that i leapt this way and that way to avoid the man and twice did strike him but yet was feared to brake the diskos upon the rock which the man did use as a shield each time that i did make a blow and all the while i did act to escape when that the man should cast the rock as i did conceive at the first to be his intent yet truly it was as that he had no wotting that a rock may be thrown for he strave only to come at me with the rock that he should crush me as with a monstrous club and in verity what should a man do against so horrid an attack and time and oft did i leap now to the right and now to the left and again in a moment i did cut the humpt man but the blow was something turned off by the great rock in the hands of the man yet so strange and mighty was the power of the diskos that it shore away a small portion of the rock and did come to no hurt in itself and surely i had presently failed in wind and limb because of the leapings and chargings that i did make and because of the weight of the armour that was not overmuch yet to be considered but that i fainted not was by reason of the wondrous hardness and leanness that i was grown to with so constant a journeying and strait living for the tablets did keep the strength in a man though truly they eased not the yearnings of the belly and lo even the brutish man did grow weary and the hot breath and body stink to come from him and surely who shall wonder for always he did rush to and fro upon me with the monstrous rock to crush me and sudden i leapt unto the right of the man thinking within me that i did perceive a chance that i should cut him upon that side but truly he was less awearied than i did know for he came very sharp upon me and had me between him and the wall of the rock and surely i had no room to make escape and had died in a moment but that i made a sudden sham toward the left with the diskos as that i should leap that way and in the same instant i did go to the right with a strong bounding and immediately did come in upon the humpt man from that side and i put my fortune of life to the stroke and stood anigh to the man and i smote him across the middle part before that he did wot of my intent and the blow slew the man very surely and did nigh cut the mighty creature in twain and surely he fell half leaping even as he died so that the monstrous rock that was in the hands of the brutish man did crash down almost upon my feet and i leapt very high that i should escape the thundering of the rock for in verity i was near slain in that last moment of the life of the humpt man but yet i lived and came free of death and did have a relief of happiness about my heart as you shall believe yet truly i was much shaken and a little weakness took me so that i was fain to go down upon the rock shelf that i have back my strength and presently i was grown steady again and i took my gear and did haste down the rock and so was come presently to the earth again and i saw the first of the humpt men that i did slay lying very quiet a little off from the bottom of the rock so that i went round upon the other side to avoid the man for it was no pleasure to mine eyes or to my heart and truly it did trouble me always to make a death and when i was come round upon the other which was the seaward side of the rock i perceived that i was yet shaken and i remembered that it were wise to eat and drink and rest a little before that i did go further upon my way now as i did sit there at the bottom of the rock i looked upward at the strange crown thereof and until that time i had been taken up with the fight and with gazings this way and that to see whether there came others of the humped men to work me an harm but now that i was given some ease of the mind and of the body i saw plainly that i knew the thing that lay upward upon the rock for the shape had been something strange and half known to me even before that moment as that i had a vague knowledge concerning it but yet with no surety and now truly i did know in a little instant that the thing was one of the olden flying ships the which as you shall mind there were certain in the great museum of the mighty pyramid and surely i was ready to wonder why that i had not seen the thing plain before that moment yet was this like to be because that there was a shadow upon the other side of the great rock but upon this side there was a little fire hill a way off to the cliff edge and this did throw a warm light that made a glimmer upon the dull metal of the ship's bottom which was uncovered to my sight and was surely of that same deathless grey metal that made the great redoubt and yet as you shall believe even as i said this thing to my mind that the strange matter upon the top of the rock was truly one of the olden air ships i did feel that i should be proper to doubt for it was a very wondrous thing to perceive a thing common to man in that utter strange country and after that i was gone so far off from the mighty pyramid yet in verity i did know in my heart that it was indeed that which i did perceive it to be and i did stand and walk to and fore and look upward constant for i was very keen that i look well upon it and truly as i did look from this place and from that place it was scarce a thing for wonder that i had not wotted it to be an air vessel for there were great trees and abundance of earth and living matters upon the topmost side of the ship so that none could easy perceive it to be aught save a great and desolate rock that did lie upon the other rock yet truly it was as i have told and presently i did make to climb upward of the great rock that i should come to the air vessel to enter it but yet was this not proper for i had surely no duty save to go forward forever until that i found the maid but yet did i spend a little while to this searching of the ship and i do but set down that which i did and with a serious spirit and truly as it doth here occur to me i do be ever seeming a serious young man as you maybe shall have grown to think but yet was i to a dread and serious business and the strain did be too great upon me and the trouble too much prest upon my heart to give me much of laughter as you do surely perceive and so you to give me your ear and your understanding for indeed before that i did lose mirdath my beautiful one i was not over grave but so young and joyous as any now it took me a great time to go upward of the rock for it was so monstrous steep and high yet presently was i come nigh under the bottom of the ship and here i did perceive that she had been sore battered in that far off age when she did come upon the rock for surely as i did perceive the peak of the rock was through the bottom of the ship so that the metal was burst this way and that and very plain to be seen in some parts but in other places the earth and growing matters did make a hiding and after that i had climbed this way and that way i perceived that i must come to the topmost part by the plants that did hang over and grow downward and after that i had pulled upon them to know that they were strong to hold me i went upon them and was soon to the top of the ship yet truly i might so well have been upon the earth for the ship was covered above by the earth and dust of a monstrous age of years so that i was like to need much time to dig downward unto the ship and because of this i considered a little while and afterward made no more to search her but did go downward again that i should come once more to my journey yet as you shall think it was with a queer thrilling of the heart and with strange thoughts upon the end of those that did come maybe to a bitter and lonesome dying in that ship of the air in that far off time when she did fly and surely it did seem to me as i went downward of the great rock how that the flying ship had been there for an hundred thousand years and that mayhaps the sea did live all about the rock in that age and truly this was no improper thing to think for it was like that the sea had been monstrous high and great in those days so that the rock was but a little island in the midst of the sea and now was the sea gone small from a great sea to lesser seas and this through an eternity of years and always as it doth seem to me had the ship lain upon the rock and lookt quiet and silent over the change and wonder and the lonesomeness of all that country of fire and water for ever but how the air ship did come upon the rock how shall i know save maybe it doth seem as that she might have flown low over the sea in that olden age and come hard upon the rock because maybe there was one to the helm that did steer unwittingly and again it shall well be otherwise and i do but set down mine odd thoughts and such as they be they have no especial use save that they do show to you the different workings of my mind at that time as i did go downward and so to set you the more in possession of all that i did have knowledge of and presently i was come again to the earth and did go forward with a great speed so that i should waste no more of that day yet oft did i think upon that ship hid there upon the mighty rock under the wondrous quiet ashes of eternity and i went eighteen hours walking and in all that time i did see no more of the humped men yet three times was i put in a sudden danger for there went past me thrice between the fourteenth and the seventeenth hours great flying monsters that were winged very ugly and did go as i thought in a great bounding rather than that they did fly proper as doth a bird yet i suffered no hurt from these for i was swift to hide between the great boulders that were very plenty in that part but no trees for i was gone now past the forests of trees there being none since that i had gone through a very shallow river that i came to about the thirteenth hour and this had i waded and sounded my path with the staff of the diskos but i had kept mine armour upon me lest there be things even in water so shallow that might bite and work harm upon me but i gat through pretty quick and had no hurt done me now i had eat as ever at the sixth and the twelfth hours and by that the eighteenth hour was come i was nigh again unto a forest that came down to the shore that went alway upon my right and i to be very sore and wearied as you shall know for i had fought very desperate after my waking and afterward climbed the great rock and then again to journey so that it was by this nigh to one and twenty hours since that i did sleep and surely i lookt this way and that way constant and did see no place proper to my slumber but afterward i considered i did be a fool to lack such for truly the trees were plentiful and i could climb a great one and strap my body safe and so have a sure bed for my rest and i did this thing and went upward into a great tree and did tie my body to the tree with my belts yet i eat and drank before that i went up the tree now when i was fast upward in the tree and had made a bed upon a monstrous branch and had the diskos ready upon my hip so that it should not fall but be nigh to my hand i lay a little while thinking upon naani and i went not over to sleep immediately which was strange yet mayhaps because that my bed was so uncertain and i considered very gravely how that it was a monstrous long while since that i did hear the master word from the dear maid and truly i was come a dreadful way from mine home which was the mighty pyramid for i had gone onward for ever through five and twenty great days of travel and was not yet come to any place that did appear like to be that place where the maid did abide and it did seem that i might even wander onward in that great country of fire and water for a time beyond all that i had before gone and this thought did put a great weight of trouble and weariness upon my heart for the maid had been in sore need of me and i did feel sudden to be all adrift in the wilderness but before this time it had seemed as that i surely went aright and mayhaps your sympathy shall tell you just how i to feel in the heart and after that i had lain there very awkward and thought upon all matters i minded me that i would try the compass again upon the morrow but had no great hopes of the machine yet did be willing to try aught to see where i had gotten to and truly as it did come to my mind if that the compass did point a little as i did wot it was used to point in the lesser redoubt then in verity i was surely come something more anigh to that unknown place of the world than i did dare to believe and this to be plain to you then a little time did pass in which i did wake and sleep and wake and sleep a little but with no surety of sleep but as that i was very tired of the heart and did but lie too wearied to come properly to sleep and odd whiles i did lie with mine eyes half to open and did look very dreamful upward among the dark branches of the tree as they did show black and pretty against the redness of the shining that came from the sea for there was stood a great and bright burning fire hill in that part of the sea that lay off the shore from me and above the glaring of the fire hill there was the deep night that did brood for ever above in a monstrous black gloom of eternity and did make the red smoke of the volcano to show deep and mighty and thunderous seeming afar up in the great dark and the red and shining smoke did but show the utter hugeness of the night that had been upon the world through the great ages and in verity as i did lie there so dreamful it did come to me afresh how wondrous strange was mine adventure and how that i did lie warm and alive in a country of red light and smoking seas and truly as i did remember and consider there was a great and lost world above me upward through the dark maybe an hundred and fifty great miles up in the grim night and this thing did strike me very solemn as i did lie and i do trust that you conceive how that there was in truth afar above in the eternal and unknown night the stupendous desolation of the dead world and the eternal snow and starless dark and as i do think a cold so bitter that it held death to all living that should come anigh to it yet bethink you if one had lived in that far height of the dead world and come upon the edge of that mighty valley in which all life that was left of earth did abide they should have been like to look downward vaguely into so monstrous a deep that they had seen naught mayhaps save a dull and utter strange glowing far downward in the great night in this place and in that and surely as you shall have seen i have set the great deep of the valley to be maybe an hundred and fifty miles of night for as you do mind it was conceived that the valley of the night land was an hundred miles deep and mayhap to be more and i had come from that place downward of the mighty slope and of the gorge a very great way yet in verity i do believe in my heart this measuring was utter wrong for i think the deep to have been monstrous beyond these miles that i do give yet have i no proving of this belief and do set it down for no more than it is now presently i had ceased from these vague thinkings and half dreamings and was gone truly to sleep yet nowise did i sleep very strong but did seem to come anigh to wakefulness this time and that and as it did chance this was mayhaps a very good thing for my life for i did presently come awake more surely and did turn on the great branch for there was a noise in the air that was not the noise of the great fire hill and the noise did grow very heavy and lumbersome and in a moment there came seven humped men running among the trees as that some monstrous thing did pursue and immediately they were beneath the tree in which i did lie so that a great fear came upon me and i loosed the belt from the branch that i should be free to fight and directly upon this i saw that the men did leap upward into the tree beneath me but not as that they did wot of me or make to come at me but as that they did pay a great heed to some creature or happening that was far off among the trees and surely the noise did seem to come from that part and did grow loud and mighty and the humped men did all crouch very silent and did make no noise or motion one to the other but were quiet upon the lower branches and as i did look now more to my ease i perceived that they had each a great stone and bloody that did seem as that it were split to a certain sharpness even as a stone doth break very natural and they carried the stone under this arm or under that arm so that they had their hands free to all matters and alway the noise did come the more anigh and i saw that a humped man did come running from among the trees and did run beneath that place where the seven humped men did be on the branches but they made no sign to the man to save him yet truly it was very plain that some monster pursued the man and immediately i saw how this thing was for the humped man upon the ground did not run so fast as might be and i conceived that he did act to make some creature to come after him to pass under the men within the tree and surely this thing did prove to be for there came very quick a great and ugly thing that had an ugly way of putting down the feet and did have seven feet to each side which was very strange and the back was as that it were horny and the belly of the thing did seem to brush heavy upon the earth and it grunted as it went and shook the earth with the weight of it so that a monstrous noise came from it upon so hasty a journey and i did wot that it was not such a thing as did properly pursue after matters of food but did rather eat of that which did need little haste but a monstrous strength to gain and that it did so make after the man was in truth because that it had been wounded and made fierce for indeed there came blood from the creature from great wounds upon the back but how these were made i could not know in that instant and it did go under the tree in which i was hid and in that moment when it past under the tree the seven humped men did leap out of the branches and did catch to the brute by the great horns of the spine and i saw that the wounds were in the joints of the spine as was plain when the back did work with the going of the creature and the seven humped men took the sharp stones from under their arms and did strike very brutal in the wounds that were in the joints of the spine and the creature roared and cried and went onward into the trees at a great speed and in all the time that it ran the humped men ceased not to strike with the stones and sudden when it was gone a distance off it did roll very swift over upon the back first to the right as that it would go that way so that the humped men did leap off upon the other side and immediately the creature rolled to that side and there ran clear of the brute only four of the humped men so that i knew that three were slain and afterwards they that lived ran beyond the beast and gat up into a second tree and the one that was chased did entice the creature to follow and so did tease it once more to pass beneath the other men and they very swiftly again to the back of the creature and so from my sight striking with the great stones and the beast bellowing very loud and piteous and how many of the humped men there were to the beginning of that strange hunting i know not but surely there were few that lived to the end and surely there were such things as this thing in the beginning of the world and again was it thus in the end and i did ponder this a little while as i did sit upon the great branch and hearken unto the sound of the hunting that was now gone a great way off and was presently beyond my hearing and afterward i gat me to the earth and did look this way and that way to see that no beast was anigh neither any of the humped men and afterward i eat two of the tablets and drank some of the water and when i had gat this far to a readiness for my going i minded me that i should try the compass again as i did intend and surely the machine did point between the north and the south upon the westward arc even as naani had told unto me yet as it did seem with somewhat more of a southward pointing than she had made me to think and because of this telling of the compass a great ease came upon my spirit for surely was not this but a sure sign that i did go direct unto that hidden place of the world where the lesser refuge did abide but yet was not come over close so that the pull of the mighty earth current of the great redoubt was something stronger than in the place where was the little pyramid and all this did i think very swift to myself and had a glad uplifting of the heart as you do perceive so that i went forward upon my journey with a great stride and did scarce fear any strange thing that all the country did hold in that moment and i went all that day at a strong pace and did be oft tempted to send the master word unto naani yet did keep from so foolish an acting the which mayhaps had brought straightway upon me an evil power and had given me to destruction when that i was near come to the succour of the maid and it was this quick and constant fear of the evil forces of the night land that did keep me ever from calling unto naani lest that they should discover me and follow after and this i doubt not you to know by now so well as i now by the sixth hour i was come into a part of the country where there were an exceeding abundance of steam fountains and sprayings and great upboilings of water in basins of rock and the air did be full of the sounds and the roarings of the boilings and the spoutings and of a hot mist and spray so that truly i had scarce the power to see to my front nor to any side and here presently i made a pause and did eat and drink and afterward went forward again and i did keep the shore of the sea always to my right and so did go proper to my way yet with no great ease for the sea also did steam very strong in that part and because of this great fog of steam i was surely much laboured to make a great speed lest unseeing i go headlong into an hole of the boiling water and in the ninth hour i did go clear of the hot boilings and was come again free of the mist and the steam and might look with mine eyes to my going and surely as i did perceive i was come to the end of the great sea that had been ever to my right for it did go against the feet of great and monstrous mountains that went upward for ever into the night and did seem as that they were the hither wall of that strange country of fire and water and so was i stood there very much taken upon doubt for how should i go farther and after that i had been there a while in a bewilderment of doubt and of wit i went to the left along the feet of the mountains and truly this but of common sense for how might i go any other way save i go back again and at the twelfth hour i eat two of the tablets and drank some of the water and went forward once more and lo at the fifteenth hour i was come to a place between the mountains even an upward gorge very dark and gloomy and without light for a great way and in verity i did not want to go up the gorge in that it was so dreary a place and narrow and horrid and drear seeming after the light and wideness of the country in which i did yet stand and presently i did go past the mouth of the gorge that i should learn whether there went another way out of that country and thiswise for a great hour more along the feet of the mountains and did presently come to a monstrous black river that was maybe a mile wide and it to be very shallow and seeming as that the water scarce to cover the mud of the bottom and here and there a great steam did come from it and spirtings and moundings up of the mud in many places and monstrous babblings and puffings up of strange smoke as that a great heat went beneath it in this place and in that and surely it went backward into the country for a mighty way so far as my sight did go and i did think it to be no river but truly a further sea and there was no way across for there were no trees anigh to make me a raft neither might i wade across for it might be shallow here and deep there and the mud be in all places and moreover i had been like to be caught in one of those upburstings of mud even did i have a raft to go upon and because of all these things i gat me back again to the gorge and presently i did go upward into the darkness now i went upward very steady save that i did stumble oft and did go through six great hours and truly it did seem that i went in an utter dark because that i had been awhile in so constant a light and by that i had been six hours in the gorge i was gone right away from the country of the seas and did be as that i was back into some place that was like to the dreadness of the night land for there were in this place and in that place of the gorge red fire holes even as in the night land yet not many until that i was come a great way up of the gorge and there did be life of horrid things about the fires as soon i did wot so that i made to keep off from them yet as you shall perceive i must come oft pretty near because that the gorge was nowheres scarce an hundred good paces across and did oft come very narrow so that i did come oft anigh to the fire holes whether that i did heed to or not and all that time and ever did the gorge go very sharp upward so that it was a very weary thing to make great trial of speed as you shall know but yet i went so fast as i could do for i was grown sudden very excited about the heart and to feel as that i did surely draw anigh to that strange and hid place of the world where was the lesser refuge and when i had gone upward through six great hours as i did say i took caution for a place proper to slumber for i was surely very wearied and i saw a place presently afar upward of the dark side of the gorge upon the right where a ledge of the rock did show in the glaring from one of the fire holes that made a gloomy light in that place and i climbed unto this ledge and did find it to be secure and awkward to come upon and presently after that i had eat and drunk i did compose myself unto sleep the which came very speedy upon me whilst yet i did believe i thought only upon the sweetness of the maid and truly it had been something over three and twenty hours since last i did sleep so that i was greatly awearied and in six hours i waked and did eat and did climb downward again to the gorge and so unto mine upward journey now as you do perceive when that i was come properly a great way up the gorge and had come among the fire holes there was no more an utter darkness for the dull red glare of the pits beat upward upon the black sides of the rock mountains that did make the sides of the gorge so that oft i did see both sides very plain in the lower parts yet of the height of the gorge who might know aught for the black sides did go upward for ever into the everlasting night and because of the light from the fire pits i did see time and oft about the fires horrid monsters both that were snakes and others like to scorpions so great as my head but no more than these for a long while and afterward i perceived that surely other matters did move among the rocks of the gorge so that i did keep the diskos very ready in mine hand yet had truly no use for it all that day now i eat and drank at the sixth and the twelfth hours and went onward at a very strong speed and at the sixteenth hour i did seem as that i knew the aether to be stirred about me and the beat of the master word very faint upon mine inward ear and immediately a wondrous great and lovely thrilling did wake all my being for surely i said this was the spirit of my love calling unto me with her brain elements and indeed this was a very proper and sensible thinking for had the master word been sent from the mighty pyramid i had been like to hear it very plain by reason of the force of the earth current which was with them and to their command but as you do know the earth current was nigh gone from the peoples of the lesser refuge so that they were over weak to make any proper calling and this i have spoken of before this place yet in a little while as i did stand very hushed that i should hark the better i was come to doubt whether that i did truly hear the master word and one moment i did say that it had surely beat in the night about me and immediately would i be just so unsure and so in a while i gat once more to my journey and had doubt in my heart yet as you shall conceive more of hope and because of this thing i went onward for thirty great hours from the time that i did wake for my heart was excited within me and when that i had gone so long forward as this i did see how that i did foolishly and i lookt about for a place for my slumber and i found a small cave that was clean and empty as i did discover by the shining of the diskos which i made to spin a little time and the cave was in the cliff of the mountain that made the right side of the gorge and was nigh twenty good feet from the bottom of the gorge and hard to approach and when i was come secure into the cave and sure that it was proper to my purpose i eat four of the tablets as was just and nice to my belly and did afterward drink some of the water and so to my slumber and all the while very sweet and strong in my thoughts upon naani so that surely i was a little time before that i had myself rightly unto sleep and i slept six hours and did wake for i had set my spirit hard unto such wakening yet was i still greatly yearning for sleep but this did go somewhat when that i had fought a little with my need and afterward i eat two of the tablets and drank some of the water and did gat my gear upon me and was presently down unto the gorge and so again to my journey now in all that day i did go with a very stern speed for it did seem as that my soul did know for surety that i was truly come something nigh unto that hid place in the night where i should find mine olden love again and the sweet hope that was bred of the calling that had seemed truly to sound about my spirit was in all my being and more sure on that day than before that i had slept and i went thirty hours in all even as before ere that i did come again to sleep and i eat and drank at every sixth hour so that my strength should abide within me and by that i was come to the ending of the thirty hours i was sorely awearied and gat me upward of the monstrous cliff that did make the left side of the gorge having perceived in a place a great ledge of the rock that did seem very proper for my purpose of slumber and when i was come upward upon the ledge of the rock i saw that there did seem something like to a mighty spider that did stay half without of a hole in the back part of the ledge and i smote the thing gently with the diskos so that it was very quickly dead and afterward i searched well about but did gladly perceive that there abode there no other horrid creature and i eat two of the tablets and drank some of the water and did afterward make me ready for slumber as ever but now i did put the cloak well about me for truly there was grown a chill into the air of the gorge and here also will i tell how that it did seem unto me that the air was gone something from that great thickness and strength which had been with me in the past days of my journeying now i was gone so tired that i fell upon sleep in a moment yet with a dear thought and anxious concerning naani but was so starved of the body for slumber that even mine anxiousness kept me not awake and i was then so fast with sleep that i knew naught for eight hours of very sound slumber and then did i awake and very thankful of the heart that no evil beast or creeping thing had come upon me whilst that i was so utter lost in sleep and now truly was i something fresh and ready and i ate and drank and had my gear once more upon me and so down into the gorge and afterward i went upon my journey for eighteen hours and did pause but a little while at the sixth and the twelfth hours that i should eat and drink and when the eighteenth hour was nigh come i perceived that the nature of the gorge was grown very horrid and dank and in verity i did feel as that afar upward in the night the black mountains that did make the sides of the gorge had come together and did make a monstrous roof unseen in the utter height and this thing i do tell only as of my belief for i have no very sure proof yet truly my reason doth say likewise for there did oft drip water upon me out of the darkness even though i walked in the middle way of the gorge and how should this thing be save that there went an overreaching of the sides that should let the mildew down upon me and in this place and for more than eleven great hours there were fire holes and fire pits only in this part and in that and each a great way off from another and they burned very dull and did seem to throw a fume of sulphur into all the air as that there was no freedom above for the stink to pass away and in every place were the rocks of the gorge very thick and slippery with strange growths so that it was a sorrow to walk upon them and all that time was there an heavy wetness and slowness in the air and a smell beside the stink of the fire pits as that i did go forward through a place where dead things did be and for a great time there was a horrid darkness as it had been that the air was grown thick with the fumings of the fire pits as i do believe and beside this thing there was as i have said but a dull fire here and another there so that it was like that there should be a heavy dark and because that it was so utter black and because that there were growths upon the rocks in the bottom of the gorge i did go but slowly and with pain of stumblings and always with the stink of that place to trouble me half unto a sickness and sudden as i did go past one of the fire pits i saw that the fire made a dull shining upon some monstrous thing that did move before me upon the far side of the fire and i came in one moment unto a swift silence and hid among the rocks of the bottom of the gorge and i lookt very cautious at the thing that moved beyond the fire and surely i had seen no thing so monstrous since that i had come free of the night land for it was as that some huge creature like to the hull of a great ship did move down out of the dark of the upper way of the gorge and it went by the fire hole and onward into the dark of the lower way of the gorge and i had perceived somewhat of it as it did go past the fire and surely it was black and beslimed and utter great in height and in length and it went always without noise so that i had not known it to be there but that i saw it plain with mine eyes and truly if i do say that it was somewhat as that i had seen a monstrous slug thing surely i should use wise and proper words to make known to you this horrid brute and i stayed very quiet a time and afterward i went upward again of the gorge and did use a new caution to my way and saw that the diskos was free upon my hip for even thus i did carry the weapon being that i must use both hands to my way and to save me in my stumblings and slidings over the slippery rocks and once it did seem to me that some great thing moved in the darkness and i went downward among the rocks and stirred not my body for a great while and sure am i that there went some living monster past me that did stink as a loathsome grave and afterward i went on again and three hours did i go thus and came at last to a place where a fire hole did shine more ruddy and i did look well about me that i should perceive that part of the gorge the better and as i stood there very quiet away off from the fire so that it did show no great light upon my person i did note how utter still was that place and this to take me anew as though it had come fresh upon me and here there would be the drip of water and again in that place and again elsewhere and all very solemn and very dismal and the silence to be constant and presently as i lookt now to this way and again to that i saw that there was a monstrous slug thing laid upward against the black side of the gorge as that it had stood up on end and the one end of the monster went upward beyond the light from the fire pit but the other part did come down and trail into the gorge as a long hillock very ugly and black and beslimed and i near sweat with a disgust and horror of the thing but afterward i had more courage and spied well upon the brute and surely it moved not at all any more than the side of the cliff of the gorge and i conceived that it stood not upward upon any feet but clung to the rock even as you shall see a slug to go and for a great space i was very quiet and moved not neither did i make to hide but stood there very stupid yet in a time i had more of courage which brought strength unto my heart and i began again to go upon my way but with an utter caution and i then to creep for a weary time upon my hands and knees among the dank and weariful rocks and boulders that lay in the bottom of the gorge and thrice between four hours was i passed by hidden and monstrous things in the horrid dark places of the gorge yet with no noise save as it might be the odd rattle of a rock in this place and that but with an utter and dreadful stinking and i to be quiet as they went as you shall think and each time now that i did go by the fire pits and fire holes that lay odd ways in the gorge i did pause and search about me with mine eyes very cautious and oft now did i perceive how that the monstrous slug creatures did lie in this place and in that against the cliffs of the gorge and i did go then utter still from this space to that space among the rocks and oft upon the flat of my belly and with a constant heed that i make not mine armour to knock against the boulders and always as i did go there was a monstrous stench and the choking of sulphurous smoke very oft and here and there as mine heart doth believe there were utter great caverns within the mountains to the right and to the left and of this thing i have some small proof for once i did go by a place where a fire did burn as it should be a fire hole afar inward of the mountain side upon my right so that i saw in a moment that i looked in the darkness through the mouth of a mighty cave place and i went past very quick and silent for i knew not whether any horrid thing should come forth out of that place to slay me and truly as i did think if there did be one such place there were like to be many and mayhaps the slugs came forth from those caverns where as i did conceive there was naught save an eternal dripping of waters and the foul growth of things in all parts yet is this last but a thought as i do say and you shall wisely take it for no more than that now i came clear of the darkness and the slime and the stinking in about twelve hours after the time that i did think the mountains to be a roof unto the gorge and the air was now free and did seem as that some life and health did abound in it and the fires did be more plentiful and burned very bright and clean and threw all their fumings upward so that there was no more any bitter pain of sulphur within my throat and surely it was with a thankful heart that i went onward and with a good speed for there was much of light all about me in that there burned an hundred fire pits here and in that place so that i saw clear before me and behind and conceived that the slugs did abide only in the closed part of the gorge and oft i did take the air very full into my lungs for the sweetness of it after the horrid stenchings that i had abode all those hours and presently when i was come free of the roofed part of the gorge maybe some three good hours i lookt for a place proper to slumber for it was surely something over three and thirty hours since that i did last come upon sleep and i was utter worn and lost of strength with so much of creeping and harking for monsters as you shall believe moreover about that time i had gone bitter long whiles between slumberings through more than an hundred hours as you shall have perceived from my tellings now presently i saw a small cave that went inward of the side of the gorge and i lookt into the cave and found it to be sweet and clean and very dry and there was a small fire pit off from the mouth of the cave that did throw a good light for my purpose so that i saw there was no creeping thing or horror in the place and i went in and made to prepare for my slumber but truly when i was come to look upon myself i was utter soiled and did seem as that i stank with the slime and disgust of the dark part of the gorge where i had gone upon my hands and upon my belly and because of this i was set that i should not eat or come to sleep without i washed me and i went out from the cave and there was a spring near to the fire pit as was oft in that part of the gorge and the spring was hot and did fill a hollow of the rock very quiet and with a fuming of sulphur as i did bend above it and i washed mine hands and face and mine armour and gear in the hot spring and did dry me with my pocket cloth and so was sweetened and put to happiness of mind and i went back into the cave and did sit in the mouth of the cave with the diskos to mine hand and i eat four of the tablets for i was gone a mortal long while without and afterward i drank some of the water and as i did eat and drink i lookt out upon the lightness of the gorge before me and with a cheerful and composed heart and i saw presently that there came certain creatures out from their holes even as it might be that they were part rats but very strange looking and not properly such and some did lie about the fire hole and some did hunt about in the rocks and one came presently and had a snake by the neck and it stood upon the snake and did eat it even while that the snake did lash about upon the rock and the snake did lash until that it was nigh all eat and a very strange thing this was to see and something troublesome to the pity yet was i glad to perceive that there were enemies to the serpents of that place and when the rat creature did make an end of the snake it made across to the spring and did drink the hot water a while and afterward back unto the fire and there laid down anigh to the edge and seeming very sweetly comforted of the belly which in truth was much otherwise with me and after that i saw many creatures that went about the fire and did have warmth from the fire and drink from the spring and surely i did ponder that the peoples of this our age should say if they had stood with me that providence had made nigh together the warmth and the drink that were needful unto life for it was grown to a bitter chill now in the gorge but rather did this thing seem to me otherwise that these creatures did be but of their circumstance and if that it had been another way then had they grown of their wits to meet it to their means of life yet as some would say the arguments do but meet and be the same thing and neither way do i care in this place but do no more than to show unto you the working of my brain in this way and that as i made my journey now presently when i was done eating and come very ready to fall upon sleep i went out from the cave and gat me certain boulders the which i did carry into the cave and when i was come back for the last time i put them very secure in the entrance way that no small stinging creature come at me as i slept and after that i made ready and went to my sleep having sweet thoughts and slumbrous of the maid now i slept very quiet that time and was not over troubled with the chill of the gorge which was but little in that place both by reason of the fire pit and because that the cave did help to keep my warmth to me and i had a deep slumber for eight hours and waked then pretty tired but strong to go upon my way and after that i had sat a little while i came full to wakefulness and afterward did eat two of the tablets and drink some of the water the which i did sitting in the mouth part of the cave after that i had cast free the boulders and afterward i gat my gear upon me and i went again upon my journey and the gorge did continue very light and cheerful with the shining of the fires and oft there did be a little steam that did hiss from this part or that of the bottom of the gorge and did blow very quaint and noisy in the quiet of that place and oft there did be hot pools and everywhere the great boulders in the bottom way and to the right and to the left the black and mighty sides of the gorge that did go upward for ever into the everlasting night and so i did go and had eat and drunk at the sixth hour and gone onward again and lo at the eighth hour i did thrill sudden with a wondrous great thrilling for in verity it did seem to me that the master word did beat softly about me out of all the night of the world and all my heart did throb with great glowings of joy yet was the beat of the word unsure so that i knew not truly whether my spirit had indeed heard aught for there was immediately a silence as ever about mine inward being yet as you shall believe there was a new hope and strength of courage in all my body and soul and i went forward very swift and all renewed as it were and my strength and hope did make naught of any terror that should lie to bar my way neither did i have further heed of the boulders that lay always upon my path but did go over them with quick leapings and a wondrous and thrilling eagerness of the heart within me and sudden in the end of the tenth hour i perceived that the mighty walls of blackness that made the sides of the gorge did be no more there and that i was come truly upon the end of the gorge and i near trembled with hope and astonishment for when i was gone a little way on i had ceased to go upward any more and was come clear out from the mouth of the gorge and did peer forth across a mighty country of night and it did seem to me as that i was come to a second land of strange matters even as the night land where did lie the wonder of the mighty pyramid and surely i did think within my heart that i was come at last to that far and hidden place of the world where did be the lesser redoubt but yet was there no place in all that night where did tower the shining lights of the lesser pyramid the which i did hope vainly to perceive and because that i saw them not a great heaviness came upon my spirits for a time but afterward the heaviness did go for i put reason to help my courage and did plan this cause and that to show why that i was not come to sight of the shining embrasures of the lesser redoubt but yet was there left an ache of doubting as you shall well conceive now this land was very new and strange and had a great light in this part and a wondrous grim darkness in that and i did pause a great while to determine how that i should go properly and presently i bethought me of the compass and did draw it forth and set it upon the earth that i should see how it did act and truly it did go almost as naani had told to me so that i was very sure in all my being that i was in verity come anigh to the hidden refuge but yet did the compass give me no proper guiding to my way so that i was no more wise to this end than before only that i had the comfort of that which it did seem to assure and in a little while i went forward into the land and did hope that i should come presently to some matter to help my choice and i went first toward a certain great glowing of fire that lay before me and did seem joined to another great glare that went afar to my left and i found the ground of that land to be very fair for my feet and to have in this place and that certain bushes even as it did seem to me of the kind that we named moss bushes in the night land as you do know and i made a very good speed and went thus until i had gone for maybe six long hours and by that time i was come anigh to the glowing of light and did keep now a strong caution to my going for truly as i did know from the tellings of the maid there were very horrid and dreadful powers in that land and i did well to remember that i was come again to parts where might be the destruction of the spirit now i made a pause and lookt toward the glowing light and it seemed to me that for a monstrous way unto the right and unto the left there did be surely a great hid valley in the earth before me for the shining did seem as that it came up from out of a valley as that there burned a deep light in such a place but yet was i all unsure and had no proper knowing whether indeed there did be any valley there but only a strange and luminous shining that did come upward from the earth and i made no great haste now to go unto that place but went down sudden into the bushes and lay upon my belly and had a new great fear upon my spirit and presently i parted the bushes a little and made a place for spying and i looked a great time unto the place of the light and now to this part and now to that and sudden i saw as it did seem a monstrous head within the glowing for the glowing did seem at whiles as that it swept to and fore as should a shining smoke that went obedient to a quiet wind and so to hide and again to uncover and in a moment i lost the great face and was all unsure that ever i had seen aught and lo in a little minute i did see it again but whether it did be the shape of some utter monster of eternity even as the watchers about the mighty pyramid or whether it did be no more than a carven mountain of rock shaped unto the dire picturing of a monster i did have no knowing but i made that i should get hence very quick and i did turn me about in the bushes and went upon my hands and knees and so came at last a great way off now presently i came again upon my feet and did take a new look around that land and i had the mouth of the gorge to my back and this i perceived by the shining of the fire pits that made the place shown to me and to the left of the gorge was an utter blackness as i did conceive of black and monstrous mountains through which the gorge did come and to the right side of the gorge there were many low volcanoes that went always along the feet of the great mountains that made the right wall of the gorge and i saw the feet of these dark mountains because that the light from the little volcanoes made a glare upon the lower slopes and so shall you have some knowing of that part of this second land of night and a good way off was the shining that i had journeyed unto and the shining went into a distant light through a part of the land that lay afar to my left for it stretched a great and strange way toward me out of the leftward gloom and came unto my front and so away into an utter distance yet though it was so great you shall not think that it made any huge light in the land but was rather as that it had a shining made unto other ends for it made not a great lightness in the land and you do now perceive something roughly how the land did seem to my back part and unto my left and somewhat before my face and because that i did think to have no profit to my search if that i went to the left i made attention unto the right and here there was much of darkness yet oft the shining of fire holes in this place and that amid the darkness and as i did look it grew very plain upon me how great was the spread and drear wideness of that country of night and how that i did be an utter lonesome person in all that dark and so shall you be with me in sympathy of the utter greatness of my task and know of the fear that did breed odd whiles that i should search until i die and never find and you to give me good human understanding now i made no more to delay but went unto the right and did keep the chain of the little volcanoes something level to my course though a great way off and i went thus with a strange growing of hope and an excitement for ten hours and had eat not then for more than twenty hours and surely not since the sixth hour of that day and this because that i was so utter shaken from my calmness of going and at the tenth hour i went utter weak and did seem surely as that i must swoon and lo i bethought me how that i was gone so long without aught for my belly and surely when i was quiet a time i eat four of the tablets and in a good while did feel all renewed and would rest no more after that i had drunk some of the water but went onward for in verity my spirit did be as that it had slain me if that i had lain down at that time and this because hope was so fierce in me for i to feel indeed that i was come near to the maid and i went ten hours more until that i did truly totter upon my feet with utter and dreadful weariness for i had gone now through someways of forty great hours and had been foolish in mine eating and drinking as you have perceived but yet was this to be forgiven for i was as that i should come any little minute upon the wonder of the lesser pyramid shining afar in the night yet truly there was nowhere anything that might be likened unto it and i lay down there just as i did be and with no proper heed to my safety and i was gone asleep in one moment as it did seem and waked not for twelve hours and then did come suddenly unto knowledge and thankful was i in the heart that no monster had come upon me in that dead time of slumbering and i eat four of the tablets as was surely due unto me and drank some of the water and so gat forward again into the night and truly i was mortal stiff and did ache for a great while and this did be in part because that i had wrapped not the cloak about me ere i slept for the land was bitter cold and did make the blood very chill now when i had gone onward through six hours i ate and drank for i did mind now to be wise and keep my strength good within me and i went onward again at a very great speed and full of an excitement and surely i did be glad at last that the tablets were so easy gone in the mouth and unfilling to the belly for i had been without power and patience to eat proper victual and at the tenth hour i saw that there rose a red shining out of the land before me as that it came upward from a mighty pit and i made slow my way and so when i was gone on for two great hours more i saw that monstrous figures went about against the red glare of the shining and i gat me down into the bushes which were very plentiful in that part and i stayed there for a certain while and made a watch upon the red shining and the figures and truly it did seem to me that there were horrid giants in that land even as in the night land and afterward i crept away and went outward from the little volcanoes into that part of the land that was dark save as you do mind for the glare of fire holes in this part and that and i went now with an utter care for the giants had put a new caution into my heart and i did surely mean that i should live to rescue mine own maid and have joy through all my life and thereafter i went with the diskos in my hand and at each hour that was the sixth i eat two of the tablets and drank some of the water and so did keep my strength very good within me now presently i was come to a place where the land did go downward a great slope and there was a difference in the earth that went beneath my feet and no great plenty of the bushes but only one in this place and one in that and nowhere any fire hole and i gat me down and did feel the earth with my hands and lo i did find presently smooth stones and afterward olden shells and immediately a great delight took me for naani had told how that the lesser pyramid stood something nigh to the shore of an ancient sea that was long dried up in the years of eternity and surely it might be that i was come down into the dry bottom of that same olden sea and should presently have sight of the little pyramid and because that hope was put so fresh into me i went forward through maybe thirty hours across the olden sea bed but in all that time i had no sight of the lights of the lesser redoubt and a great trouble began to take me for indeed naani had not told me how great was the sea and it might be that i should wander a weariful age across it before that i come to the far side and it did come to me presently how that i should be wise to see that my way was very straight so that i waste not my strength in useless wanderings and i had a great care now to observe that the red shining did be always upon my right to my rear and by this reasonable cunning did i make to steer very nicely through the great gloom of that place now as i did go across the bed of the great sea i heard strange sounds now in this part of the darkness and now in that and oft did there be a noise as if things did run this way and that way in the bed of the sea and once afar off in the night there did be a strange and horrid screaming so that i did know truly that the monsters of that land were out and did go about in the dark and as you shall perceive and understand i was all unknowing of the lore of that land so that i knew not what to think of this strange sound or that neither knew i what they might portend but only that as i did say there were monsters abroad and i could do no more than have my way forward with an utter care always and be very ready with the diskos or to hide each as maybe according to the need and surely i went one and forty hours that day and eat and drank after every sixth hour and before this in the seven and thirtieth hour i heard a great roaring and bellowing in the night coming nigh unto me and afterward the thudding of monstrous feet as that a giant ran past me in the darkness and did make a chase of some creature and the thudding of the feet and the roaring went far off into the night and there did seem presently to come back to me from a great way a little screaming but of this thing i had no surety and i abode very hushed in a clump of bush until quietness was come again all about for there had been an utter frightening sound in the horrid voice and in the thudding of the great feet now in the one and fortieth hour of that day i came upon the farther shore of the olden sea but lo there was nowhere any light to tell me aught of the lesser refuge and truly a great doubt and bewilderment took me for indeed i could not perceive how it might be that i saw not the lights of the embrasures of the lesser pyramid and a great despair took me so that i sat down there upon the shore of the olden sea and had no heed of anything for a while but afterward i ate and drunk and went into a clump of bush and wrapt the cloak about me and so went fast unto sleep with the diskos handy to my breast and in verity the pain of the despair and the bewilderment of mine heart did make rather for sleep than to keep me wakeful for indeed i was half stunned of the brain and of my courage and did seem now the farther off from the ending of my search than ever i had been and i slept six hours and waked then sudden and i leaned up upon mine elbow in the bush and harked very quiet perchance some noise had shaken my sleep from me but indeed there was nothing only that i was wakeful and did mind me of my trouble of failure yet now i did invent this thing and that thing to make natural account that i was not come to the lesser redoubt and so had hope again within me yet much also of doubt and bewilderment and i eat two of the tablets and drank some of the water and again to my journey and i made that i should keep along the shore of the sea the which i did through twelve hours and was then still so much in doubt as ever and i ceased from my journeying and lookt about me over the land and lo i did note how that a weak and strange shining was in the air of the land at a great way as it had been that a far spreaded and faint glowing made a little glare into all the night unto my left and before me now i ate and drank and made to steady my spirit for i did fear lest i should feel utter lost in all the night of the world and to know not where to make any more my search and so to grow desperate in despair and this thing you will understand and afterward i did make across that land unto the place where it did seem that the dull shining was something bright and i went thus through eighteen hours and did make pause at each sixth hour and ate and drank very resolute though in verity it did seem as that even so small a matter as the tablets did be like to choke me and by this is it plain to me how great an anguish was come upon my spirit lest that i was all astray and should have no joy to succour mine own and thrice in the time that i did go there did be a running of feet amid the darkness and odd whiles strange and horrid cryings in the night so that i put a force upon my despair and hid me for indeed i had no right to lose care of my life if there did be any chance yet that i find the maid and lo in the eighteenth hour which was truly the thirtieth of that day i found the shining in the night to be grown very plain and an utter stinking of sulphur and truly i did be aware that the land went upward and i made upward through seven hours and the light did grow more plain and was of a dull redness very sombre and heavy and in the end of six more hours i ceased to go upward and did know of a strange low sound that did be like to no other sound that ever i did hear and was like to a dull roar that did never have ceased through eternity and i went forward unto the light and the land to be now as that i went over an upland plain and i did go thus through five hours and the low roar did grow ever upon mine ears and truly even as i did shape my thoughts to take a caution for my body i went upward again a little and came out upon the edge of a mighty cliff and the low and constant roar did moan upward against me with an everlasting muttering and i lookt downward a monstrous way and surely there was spread out a mighty sea as it did seem of dull fire as that a red hot mud did lap very deep and quiet below me in all that night and i lookt outward across the strange sea and the far side was hid from me for surely there were dull and solemn clouds that came off the sea and hid the distance from me and the clouds to glow a little redly and so to rise and presently to blacken into the night and i lookt to the right and to the left and it was plain that the black cliffs did stretch out both ways and did go downward ever into that monstrous sea of slow fire and there were great headlands that went out into the fire as into a sea and the fire did lap very quiet about these and where the fire lapt about them there did shine and spirt out green flames and vapours at diverse times and indeed as i did perceive i was come to an upward sea of fire as it were the deep inwards of a low and utter monstrous volcano that was flat of the top and utter big across and in verity i did look downward into the fires of the inward earth and a very wondrous sight was it to stand there alone upon the cliffs of that everlasting sea and a great heat came upward from the dull and grim fire of that gloomy sea and a reek of sulphur so that i was like to be choked and did go backward from the edge of the cliff and surely i was come to the end of that dark land upon that side and had nowhere perceived the lesser pyramid in all the night of my travel and a new despair came upon me for indeed it seemed i was come all astray in the night of the world and did nowise have any knowing whether i stood near to the country of the lesser redoubt or whether that i was gone half across the world unto a strange place and then as the despair troubled my spirit and dulled the beating of my heart a sudden thought did light up a fresh hope within me for indeed as you do know i was come upward of a great height and did surely have a huge view over all that land and mayhaps the lesser pyramid did lie somewhere in a valley if in verity it did be anywheres at all in that country and i turned me from the cliffs and lookt backward over all the night of the land but there was nowhere in all that country the shining of the lights of the lesser pyramid and lo of a sudden i did know that there was something in the night and i stared with a very keen and anxious look and behold there was the black shape of a great pyramid afar off in the night that did show against the shining of the distant light for it did stand between me and the far off fires but until i was come to that place whence i did look i had not stood to have it plain against the shining upon the other side of that land and how i did feel in that moment i have no words to set out unto you but surely was my heart gracious with thankfulness and i ready to leap with joy and hope and all my body thrilled with an excitement that would not have me to be silent so that suddenly i began to shout foolishly across the night but i came soon to wisdom and silence as you shall think x the maid of the olden days now as you shall perceive all mine utter despair was turned in a moment into an huge gladness and a great hope so that it did seem to me that i should be with my dear one in but a little while yet was this an over hope and expectation and was not like to have a swift satisfying for truly i was made aware of naught save that i did perceive the shape of a great pyramid going upward into the night and i knew that the pyramid did surely stand upon an hill in the midst of that dark country for only so might it show so great and high and i set me to run swift downward into the land so that i should make a strong going unto the pyramid and i ran for a few little minutes and lo i fell headlong and did truly feel as that i had brake my neck with the hardness and pain of my fall and i had no power to go forward any more for a great while but did just be there where i did fall and very helpless and moaning a little so that any creature had been able to slay me if that it had come upon me in that time yet presently i was able to sit upon the earth and did hold my neck with my hands and afterward the pain went away so that i gat once more to my feet but now i went forward very wisely and had moreover an anxiousness in my heart for indeed how did it be that the pyramid was so utter dark if that it did be the lesser refuge in truth and immediately there did rise in me a fear that it should be some house of evil in the dark of that land or some wicked force working a pretence and a bewilderment upon my sight yet truly the thing was plain now against the far off fires of the land and i did have little thought but that it should be in verity the lesser refuge now in the first moment that i did perceive the dark pyramid i had been without wit save to run very quick and blind unto the place for you to remember how long i had made so great a search and afterward i had been minded to call unto naani with my brain elements sending the master word and my speech after to tell how that i was come unto her but now i did heed to have caution and to discover what this darkness should truly mean and so did i go downward again into the night of that land at the first with a carefulness but presently with a fierce eagerness and expecting of the heart the which had been dulled a little time with the horrid shaking and pain of my fall now i had climbed unto the upper plain of the great volcano in maybe thirteen hours but i went downward of that great hill in ten and had made a greater speed but that i was sore shaken and unsure by reason of my fall and in the end of the tenth hour i perceived that i was come again to the great plain of the land and i had no more any proper sight of the refuge because that it was upward afar in the darkness of the night yet was i abled now to see that there went a bulk between me and the far shinings and did know that this great thing was surely the hill on which the pyramid did stand and i went four hours across the land and did pass in this place and that fire holes that made a little red shining in the night and because of the fires in those far parts and a near there was not an utter dark and when i was gone four hours towards the pyramid i could no more see the distant shinings for the bulk of the hill bottom stood up between and made all a blackness that way and by this thing i did guess that i was come nigh unto the hill but yet was a great hour more before that i came to it and in that five hours since i was come down from the great volcano there had past me thrice and again the sounds of things running in the night and once there did be a sound as of a giant roaring afar and a strange and horrid screaming now i began to go up the hill and at the first an utter excitement took me in the heart so that i could have shouted the name of the maid aloud in the night with vain hopings that she should hear me and make an answer but this state went from me very swift as i did go upward and there came a caution again about me and a coldness of fear as that my spirit did wot of something that my heart did not perceive and presently i was come upward almost to the top of the hill the which took me nigh three hours and surely when i was come that i could see the grimness of the pyramid going upward very desolate and silent into the night lo an utter shaking fear did take me for the sweet cunning of my spirit did know that there abode no human in all that great and dark bulk but that there did await me there monstrous and horrid things that should bring destruction upon my soul and i went downward of the hill very quiet in the darkness and so in the end away from that place and i was four great hours before that i was come clear away from the hill and i did feel that there was not any safety for my spirit in all that land and surely i went a little blindly in the first and did go with no heed unto my way and presently i was upon the shore of the olden sea and had no knowing how that i was come there for surely i did think it to be a great way off but now i do think that the dry bed of the sea did curve around unto that place or that there did be two or more olden seas in that country of night now presently i sat me down very weak and bewildered for it was as that my heart did lie dead within me and in verity you shall perceive how this thing was for i did know by the tellings of my spirit that there abode evil things in the dark pyramid upon the hill and i doubted not but that destruction had come upon the peoples of the lesser pyramid and that evil creatures and powers did now abide in that place and if this thing did be truly so i was come over late to the saving of the maid and with this thought i was very glad that some evil thing should come that i should fight with it and die quickly for there was naught then in all the world to make me glad to have life and so shall you know the utter desolation that was in my heart and truly i can perceive both the wiseness and the unwisdom of my reasonings for indeed i did have no sure knowing that the dark pyramid did be truly the lesser refuge but yet in verity my spirit did know with a certain sureness and there was no doubt concerning this thing in all my being and after that i had sat there awhile i did mind me suddenly that i should send the master word through the night for indeed how else might i ever know whether naani did yet live though in truth i had little save desperate hope in this matter but yet did remember how that i had seemed odd times of my journey to hear the beat of the master word with my spirit out of all the dark of the world and in verity if naani answered not to the word but there came instead an evil power to destroy me i should but cease me of mine utter heart ache and i stood me upon my feet and looked outward about me into the blackness of that land and i sent the master word with my brain elements and immediately i called naani thrice sending the call with my brain elements and lo in a moment as it did seem there broke around me out of all the mystery of night low and solemn the master word beating in the night and immediately there did sound within my brain a far small voice very lone and faint as that it had come from the end of the world and the voice was the voice of naani and the voice of mirdath and did call me by mine olden love name then indeed i did near to choke with the utter affright of joy that did take me in the heart and also i was shaken with a mighty excitement and my despair was gone as that i had never known it for in verity naani did live and did call unto me with her brain elements and surely i had not heard the voice of mine own for an utter age of grim labour and dread and the voice was as i did say as that it came from one that did be in a far place of the earth and in verity whilst i stood dazed with a great joy that the maid did live i knew within me concerning the fear that she was utter far off and what peril might come anigh to her before that i should stand to her side to do battle for her life and well being and mine own joy and lo in the same moment and before that i made further speech unto naani i did wot that someone did be a little way off from me in the bushes where a fire hole did burn anigh to me and it was as that my spirit knew this thing and told of it unto my brain and i made no answer unto the maid across all the dark of the world but went very swift into a great bush that was nigh to the fire hole upon this side and i lookt through into the open space that did be about the fire hole and there was a little figure that did kneel sobbing upon the earth beside the fire hole and truly it was a slim maid and she did seem as that she harked very desperate even whilst yet she did sob and surely mine own soul did know all in one white moment of life and she there unknowing and harking unto a cry of the spirit that she did think to come through all the desolation of the night even from the mighty pyramid for oft as i did perceive had she cried unto me in all that lonesome month and known no answer neither that i was making a desperate way unto her for indeed her weakness was great so that she had no power to throw the word strongly afar neither to make plain her spiritual cryings through any mighty space of the aether and lo i drew in my breath and set my teeth a moment to steady my lips and i said mirdath out of the bush where i did be and using natural human speech and the maid ceased from her weeping and lookt this way and that with an utter new fear and with a frightened hope that did shine with her tears in the light from the fire hole and i divided the bush before me and went through the bush so that i came out before her and did be there in my grey armour and i did pause then and was all adrift in myself for my heart said that i should take this maid into mine arms again for that i was come again to be with mirdath after an utter lost eternity but yet was i all paused for truly she was naani and she was mirdath and she did be a stranger in mine eyes and very dainty and pretty and shaken with woe and sore trouble and grief and in that same moment of my coming unto her out of the bush she screamed and fell back from me and strove weakly to gain unto the hither bushes for truly she knew not what was come upon her in that first little moment and immediately she saw that it did be an human man and no monster to slay her and in that instant i said the master word unto her aloud that she should have knowledge of peace and help and i told my name and said i am that one and she knew this thing even as my lips made the sounds and she cried out something in an utter broke voice and ran unto me and thrust her two small hands into my charge and keeping and fell thence into a great sobbing and shaking so that i was all in trouble to ease her but did keep a silence and held fast her hands for i had not on mine armoured gloves and she leaned against me very weak and seeming wondrous like to a child and lo in a while she ceased to sob and did but catch her breath this time and that but said no word and i bethought me that she did suffer of hunger for i perceived that she had been long wandering and alone and was come unto the end of hope when that i did come and the maid stood there yet silent for she might not yet command her mouth to speak and she trembled as she stood and i opened my left hand and lookt at the hand within my palm and surely it was utter thin and wasted and i made no more pause but lifted mine own and set her easy upon the earth with an hump of smooth rock unto her back and i stript off my cloak very quick and put it about her for she was scarce covered with her clothes that had been all torn among the bushes so that part she shook with an utter chill and part because of weakness for she was nigh to be starved unto her death and destroyed with her grief and lonesomeness and i took from my back the scrip and the pouch and i gat a tablet from the scrip and brake it into my cup and with the water i made a little broth very swift upon an hot rock that was to the edge of the fire hole and i fed the broth unto the maid for truly her hands did shake so that she had spilt it all if that i had done otherwise and she drank the broth and was so weak that presently she did fall again to sobbing yet very quiet so that i strove not to be troubled in the heart for indeed this thing was but reasonable and not cause for me to have an anxiousness but i put my hands under the cloak and took her hands into mine and held them strong and firm and this did seem to bring something of peace and strength unto her so that presently the trembling and the weeping went from her and indeed the broth was surely helpful in this matter and presently i knew that her hands did stir a little within mine and i loosed somewhat of my grip and immediately she graspt my hands with a weak and gentle grasp but lookt not yet at me only did stay very quiet as that she did gather her strength within her and indeed i was content save that an anxiousness of the heart did stir me this time and that lest some monster should come upon us and because of this trouble i did hark about me now and oft and with a new and strange fearfulness of danger because that now mine own was given unto my charge and surely my heart would break if that there came any hurt unto her now of a sudden the maid did make as that she would rise and i loosed free from her to give help and she gat me by the hand and slipt sudden to her knees and did kiss my hand and did begin again to weep and surely i was so utter abashed that i stood very stupid and let her do this thing but in a moment i drew free from her for this thing might not be and i gat me to my knee likewise before her and took her hands and kist them once newly humbled as it were and thus should she know all that was in my heart and of mine understanding and she did but sob the more for she was so weak and utter moved unto me because that i had come to her through the night of the world and this thing i knew though no speech had yet past between us and i gave up her hands lest she need them for her tears but she left them to lie in my palms as she did kneel there and she bowed her head a little over her weeping but did show that she was mine in verity unto the very essence of her dear spirit and i took her into mine arms very gently and without caress but presently i stroked her hair and called her naani and mirdath and said many things unto her that now i scarce do wot of but she did know them in the after time and she was very quiet in mine arms and seeming wondrous content but yet did sob onward for a great time and oft did i coax her and say vague things of comfort as i have told but truly she did ask no more comfort at that time than that she be sheltered where she did be and truly she had been lonesome and in terror and in grief and dread a great and horrid time now presently she was grown quiet and i made to put her comfortable in the cloak against the rock that i should have freedom to make her more of the broth but yet she did nestle unto me with a little sweet wistfulness that made warm my heart in a most wondrous fashion for surely she was mine own and she to begin to say odd words to me and so to have gentle obedience and to rest quiet against the rock the while that i did make the broth yet ever her gaze did follow me as i knew for i must look oft her way and i took the broth to her and she drank it using her own two hands and i sat by and eat three of the tablets and drank some of the water for truly it was a foolish great time since last i had eat now in a while the broth did make bright the eyes of the maid and she did begin to talk and at whiles had pauses because that she lacked of strength and there was more to be told than an human may have the heart strength and cunning to make plain and twice she did come again to sobbing for truly her father was dead and the peoples of the lesser redoubt all slain and dispersed through the night of that land and i learned that an evil force had made action upon the peoples within the lesser redoubt so that some being utter weak by reason of the failing of the earth current had opened the great door and gone forth into the night and immediately there had come into the lesser pyramid great and horrid monsters and had made a great and brutish chase and had slain many but some had escaped forth into the night and with these had come naani after that her father the master monstruwacan had been slain by a shaggy man very brutal and monstrous and there had been three maids with naani when that she made escape into the night but there had come certain creatures upon them as they did sleep among the bushes and had stolen two and the other maid had run off as did naani and they had neither met the other any more and this dreadful happening unto the peoples of the lesser redoubt had been a great while gone as it to seem to her but she had no means to tell me how long this time should be for in verity how should she make a count yet had it been a dread long while unto her and i found presently that she had been lost through all that time that i did make my journey unto her for indeed this thing i discovered by asking concerning my callings unto her and she had heard none that did come to her in any time since she had escaped out of the lost refuge into this dreadful land yet in verity oft had she callen unto me until that her heart did grow sick with the desolation of her lonesomeness and her utter forsakeness and her callings had told unto the evil things of the land that she did be in this part and that for there had come things and beasts in search for her but having the gift of the hearing she had known of their approach most whiles and had come free from them yet oft times with piteous and fearful runnings and hiding among the rocks and the bushes so that she had grown afterward to make no calling unto me save odd whiles lest she bring the monsters upon her and indeed as you do know naught had come plain unto me for she was so utter weak that she had no power of her brain elements to send the word afar or the tellings of her spirit and because that she was so sorely chased she had come nigh to be naked even as i found her for the bushes and the rocks had torn her garments from her and she had naught with which to make any proper mending of them and for food she had eat the moss upon the rocks and odd strange berries and growths and had drunk of the waters of the hot springs and oft had she been made utter sick because of the sulphur or somewhat of the water and maybe the poison of odd plants yet as i did think it was like that the first did save her life from the second but in this thing i do make only a guessing and in all that dreadful time since that she had come to be quite alone she had heard a score drear things for there had been once the slaying of a young maid nigh unto her by some brute out in the darkness of the land and thrice and more had she heard the feet of people running this way and that and the tread of giants pursuing and by this telling i did understand those things which mine ears had told to me as i did go across that land and surely a new pity and sorrow and horror did come upward within me and the maid told me how that she came once upon certain of the peoples of the lesser redoubt as they did hide among the bushes but they ran with no heed to her callings that she did be human even as they and by this is it plain the sore and dreadful panic that was upon the hearts of such and the bitter chill of the land had made her to strive alway to be nigh unto the fire holes that were very plentiful but even as this did be needful unto her so was it a thing that drew the monstrous brutes of that land even as i had found in the night land and in the upward gorge and because of this she was oft made to stay afar off in the utter cold of the night yet in truth odd whiles she did be so desperate that she would make the venture and so mayhaps have a time of warmth and because of this she had been nigh slain in her sleep twice and thrice moreover there were snakes about the fires though not over plentiful in all parts and there did be spider crabs and monstrous scorpions and indeed even as she had lain by the fire hole very weak and seeming near unto her death even this time when my call had come unto her to stir her unto life and bitter knowledge of despair even then was she all surround by creatures that were like to crabs that did squat all about her and did but wait for her to die so that she had been feared to sleep lest they destroy her in her slumber and by this thing she had known that her death was surely nigh and lo out of all the night of the world had come the beat of the master word strong and powerful beating as a low and spiritual thunder out of all the dark of the night yet had she thought of me only as speaking from the far off mighty pyramid so that the cry had brought naught of hope unto her but only a newer and more known despair and behold in a little minute there had come her name spoken surely with the tongue and a name that was different from the name that my spirit had said after the beat of the word and immediately i had come out of the bush and she had fallen back in a sudden great fear that a monster was stolen upon her and then did see a young man in grey armour and did know in one instant that i was that olden one of her memory dreams and the one that had spoken unto her in the spirit across half of the dead world as it did seem and now was i come through all that unknown desolation and affright to succour her and she was immediately safe but yet all broken because of her weakness and her utter joy and her sweet honour for me and this is the chief of that which she did tell unto me and the way that she had seen and did regard the marvel of this our coming together but surely no man was made ever to be worthy of the way that she did look upon me or of the words that she did say unto me in her weakness and happiness now with the maid having speech concerning the spider crabs i lookt presently well around and surely in a minute i saw that they were not gone away but did be a circle of silent and steadfast watching and impudence and horror all about us and surely this thing put an anger and disgust upon me so that i gat to my feet and went unto the border of the light and i spurned this little monster and that and did truly kick maybe a dozen before that they were content to be gone and by this thing shall you know of their calm and foolish assurance but yet were they seemingly without courage for they made not to attack me yet a true crab of this day been wishful to pinch me had i put my toe forth unto it now i went back to the maid and she did laugh with a little weak gleefulness so that i perceived that she was like to be a very joyous maiden if but i did have her in health and i made her another cup of the broth and she drank it very easy and afterward i made a very stern and playful order that she must sleep and indeed she to need it sore for she was gone again from her excitement and her weakness upon her yet very happy and content and without fear and i made a smooth place for her and put the pouch and the scrip to be for a pillow and i did lay her there very quiet and sweet in the cloak and covered her feet but indeed i saw first that they did be sore cut and without any gear to them so that i perceived that mine own had worn out her foot gear utter in her lonesome journeyings and in running from brutes that did come to find her and so i to know more in the heart somewhat of the true dreadfulness and fear that had companioned mine own and i was minded then that i would wash and bind up her feet but yet was she so utter worn that i did prefer that she sleep so soon as she might and afterward when she was come wakeful again then should i take a proper heed of her feet and truly they were very small and shapely and presently she slept and surely i doubt whether she had slumbered so peaceful and proper for a great month for she never to have known when any evil thing should come upon her in her sleep and this to be a very dreadful feeling as you do know well for you do know how i had been in this same matter now while naani did sleep i stript off mine armour and took off mine under suit which was named the armour suit and a very warm and proper garment and made thick that it should ease the chafe of the armour and afterward i put on the armour again but the suit i folded and laid beside the maid for truly she was nigh unclothed by reason of the bushes and the rocks that had rent her garments all wise and i stood watch for the maid the while that she did slumber and surely she went ten long hours and i walked upon this side of the fire hole and now upon that and did oft cease that i might hearken both with mine ears and with my spirit for truly i was all wakened to a new care and delight and did have a fresh and doubled fear of any horrid creature or force of evil and this shall be very plain to you and in the end of ten long hours the maid wakened and i ran to her all joyed that she was come again to knowledge and to be that i could talk with her and she sat upward and looked at me and there was new light and movement in her so that i knew her strength was come back into her and for a little minute she said naught unto me the while that i did ask how she did be and she lookt at me very keen so that i wondered some wise in a daze what was in her mind and she askt me of a sudden how long it did be since that i had slept and having not thought to put away her asking because that the question was over sudden i said four and eighty hours which should be three days and the half of a day of four hours and twenty and this thing i knew because that i kept alway a very careful counting of the hours lest that i get all adrift and know not how long i was taken to come to this place and that and truly even as i told this thing to the maid i was grown very quaint in the head for indeed i was gone a wondrous while without slumber and had done much and bitter work in that time and before then had been much lacking of rest as you do know and sudden the maid cried out something and tost the cloak from her and had me into her arms and did heed not to have any foolish shame of her nakedness and in verity i knew not how i was gone so strange but do see now that i was nigh to swoon for lack of slumber and rest and she kept me very steady for a little and afterward helped me to be laid upon the ground and she put the scrip and the pouch under my head and so i did lie very calm and restful and did be the more so because that i was grown so tired in the heart the which did make my head to be very husht as that all the world was grown very quiet in a moment and the maid did mind then that she did lack to be properly covered and she gat the cloak and put it about her and did afterward sit a little beside me and did rub my hands and presently i was something more to myself and she did grow more happy of her mind and made to give me something for my stomach for indeed i was grown those late hours to be foolish and to have no wiseness to proper eating and she did lift my head the while that she did take the scrip from under and kept me very sweetly upon her knee and so until she had gat free a pack of the tablets and the flask and the cup for i had put all matters back into the scrip before naani had gone unto sleep and because of this i had not been able to eat or drink aught save by wakening her as you perceive for indeed i had put the scrip and the pouch under her head for a pillow as i have told and she would not bide that i should do aught but only did ask concerning the making of the water and was wondrous amazed to see how the powder did fizz up and become water and indeed she had too much into the cup for truly it rose up and ran to the ground and when she had done thus and ceased to marvel she put three of the tablets into the water and made me a broth even as i had made a broth for her but indeed i was in no need and had done very well to eat the tablets and drink the water yet truly i was not wishful to lack the love of her way as you may think now while i did drink the broth i did be very restful upon the earth and mine head against mine own maid and i did mind me now that i tell her concerning the armour suit that i did mean for her wear yet i said not that i had stript it from me for then she had been like to say nay and to trouble that i was like to come to a chill as is the way of a woman but indeed i might so well have told her for truly she did know on the moment and set to a little unto weeping yet very gentle and sweet and did kiss me as i lay there and say such things as should make a young man the better to have heard if but that his own dear love doth say the same and she would nowise wear the garment but yet in the end i prevailed by gentle reasonings and because that i was her master as i was born to be and moreover her own sweet sense did show that i spoke for wisdom for how should she come through all the bitter way before if that she had not a strong and close made garment and as you do mind her coverings did be in utter rags as i have told yet very sweet and clean as i had known so that i ween she had stript oft in the lonesome night and washt her garments in this or that hot spring of the sulphur waters and other matters and in verity alway she was much given to washings as i did soon perceive now presently i did be very well again but with a sore slumber that did press upon my head yet ere i should sleep i did mean that i bathe her feet and bind them with ointment and with my pocket cloth and truly her feet were very small and pretty and i sat me up talking my head from her knee and told her of mine intent but in verity she did but throw her arms about my neck and give me one loving kiss and laught so hearty that i did think to do this thing when indeed she was the better able to mind it and i the better suited to have me to my rest and surely this was very true and i made no ado save to give her the ointment but lay back and did be quiet now i did be upon my right side and she went to my back and took the cloak from about her and spread it upon me and afterward stoopt over very dainty and kist me and bade me to go very swift to my sleep for that she did mean to make her toilet and to get into mine armour suit and i made no foolishness in this matter yet told her to ease the cloak a little about me so that i should have room to take the diskos from my hip and this thing i did and took the diskos to my breast as was my habit and surely i saw that her eyes did look at me with a little shining because that i had so strange and fierce a bed mate and i made her to promise that she keep a very keen harking the which was like that she should do and to call me on the instant that she did perceive any unease in the night and after that i shut mine eyes that i should not shame her and put out mine arms and kist her once and turned from her unto my slumber and she away to my back that she might be modest to her needs and surely i was asleep in but a little moment and with a great love and delight in my heart and in all my being and truly i waked not for twelve great hours and when that time was gone lo i came awake and surely the maid did sit beside me so bonny and so winsome and pretty that mine arms went unto her in a moment and she into them and gave me a loving and tender kiss and afterward slipt away from me very sensible and loving and did stand up and turn about to be lookt at for she did wear the armour suit and surely it was loose upon her but yet very pleasing being close knit and i to my seat from lying that i might see the maid the better and in verity i must kiss her again for she did be with her hair all about her that she look pretty unto me and her little feet did be bare and so that they made my heart new tender to look upon them for truly she was utter lost of foot gear and i to my knee to her and she not to deny me did come to be kist again now when i found how great a time i had slept i did scold mine own but yet as she did say i must have long slumber if that i go so long wakeful else should i lose my strength and i askt how oft she had eat and she told me but the once and that six hours off and on this i did scold again but surely she put a very pretty finger sudden upon my lips so that i might do naught but laugh and kiss that same finger and after that we did eat and drink and made plans and once i did comfort the maid for indeed her sorrow did rise in her because that her father was come unto his death and the peoples of the lesser redoubt all destroyed and adrift in the night amid the monsters of that land and in verity i was set that we go quickly out of that place ere there came an horrid destruction upon us and surely there should scarce be any human beside in all that land for there must have come death upon the chief of those that did make escape and after we had eat and drunk i did count the packs of the tablets and was thankful in all my being that i had been careful and denied my belly for i did perceive that there were left enough for our needs if that we made a good speed and did not fear to be empty and of the water powder as it might be named there were left two full flasks and somewhat of that one that i had drunk from all my journeying and by this thing you shall perceive that we did not be like to die for the need of such matters and here as it doth occur unto me i do ponder how it did be that we had no thought to slay any small creature for our food but mayhap we had no knowledge this way for surely they did not this thing to my knowing in the mighty pyramid but yet as i have said before this i have not all knowledge of the doings of the peoples but in verity i never saw joint meat in all the time of that far life that i do wot of yet had we but slain somewhat for our hunger in that great wandering we had been less empty in the belly now before that we should do aught beside we must contrive that naani have some gear for her feet and to this intent i did make a search into the pouch and surely i found that there did be a change pair of inner shoes that were made to go within mine own shoes of the grey metal and at this i was wondrous glad and did make the maid to sit upon a little rock while that i made a fitting of the shoes and surely they did be utter big and clumsy upon her little feet so that i was in surprise to know how great is a man beside a maid but in the end i had a cunning thought for i cut off all the side of a strap throughout the length of the strap very thin and careful and so had a lace to tie the boots around the tops which were soft and easy for such a purpose and after that i stood away to look at the maid and neither she nor i were truly pleased for indeed she was too pretty to be so hid and muffled yet were we glad otherwise for now she might go without hurt to her feet and afterward we packt our gear and she did make a bundle of her torn garments for truly they might be proper somewise to our need and so we to begin the way out of that desolate land and we went forward together across the land and the journey was no more a weariness but of a close and sweet joy yet did i have a new anxiousness as you do perceive lest that any monster come to harm mine own and we went twelve great hours in the bed of the olden sea and did eat twice in that time and surely the maid did grow utter weak and weary for she was not come proper unto her strength yet did she make no odd saying to tell me of this thing but indeed i did know and i stopt in the thirteenth hour and took her into mine arms even as i should carry a babe and i went forward with her and did hush her protesting with a kiss and afterward she did but nestle unto me and shelter against my breast and i bade the maid to sleep but indeed she had no power to this end for her body did ache very sore but yet did she strive to give me an obedience in this thing and in the eighteenth hour when that i stopt to have food and drink surely she did be awake yet had she been utter silent and i made to scold her but she gat from mine arms and did go upward upon her toes and put her finger against my lips very naughtily and afterward she did be impudent unto me and did deny me to kiss her but she went unto my back and did open the scrip and gat me to my food even as a quiet and proper wife should go as she did be so sedate that i knew she had mischief her heart of harmless kind but afterward this did pass sudden into weeping for she had a quick and sore memory of her father and of the destruction and i took the maid into mine arms and did let her be there very gentle and made not to kiss or to comfort her but yet to give comfort and presently she ceased from weeping and did slip her hand into mine and i to keep it within very soft and quiet and afterward she began to eat her tablets yet always she did be very husht so that i did be quiet also and feel as that my love did be round her as a shield and i knew that she had knowledge of this thing in her heart and oft i harked into the night of the land but there was nowhere any sound or disturbing of the aether to trouble me and the maid in mine arms did know when that i harked for in verity she had the night hearing and the understanding spirit that doth be needful to such and odd whiles did i look down to her through the gloom that did be about us and presently i did perceive that she lookt up to me out of mine arms and i kist her now in all that day we had come nowhere upon any fire hole in the bed of the olden sea and truly i did ache to be nigh unto the warmth of such for i did feel the cold of the land because that i was weary and because that i had not the thickness of the armour suit below mine armour to warm me and the cloak did be about the maid for i had feared that she should grow cold as i carried her yet now she did know subtly that i was come to feel the utter chill of the land and she gat from mine arms and put the cloak about me and afterward came again into mine arms and i let the cloak bide there and drew it forward to be around her also yet truly i was joyful that i did be cold as you shall perceive for it was sweet to the heart to bear somewhat of that dread chill for mine own and she half troubled and likewise with understanding of my heart because that i was less clothed than i had been now in a little while the maid did pack the scrip and so we did make ready again to go forward for i was grown anxious as you may suppose that we should come to some fire hole that we have a place for sleep that had warmth and light for truly the cold of the land did be drear and horrid and i stoopt to take the maid into mine arms that i should carry her but she did say nay that she did be well rested and i not to gainsay her for she did mean the thing as i perceived and i had no desire to force my way upon her save when i saw truly that she did seem to go unwisely and indeed when such did be the case i did strive with her only with a nice reasonableness as you shall know and the maid walkt by my side and wondrous silent but yet very nigh to me so that i knew she did be very full of love to me and of that quaint and sweet humbleness that love doth breed odd whiles in a woman when she doth be with her man if but that man be also her master and presently i perceived that the cloak did be over mine own shoulders and i took it and would have put it about the maid but truly she did not allow this and when i did be stern with her that she obey me in this matter she did stand upon her toes that she might kiss me and pulled my head down and surely she kist me and coaxed me that i wear the cloak else should i give pain to her in that i did surely be cold because she did wear the armour suit yet i would not hark to this thing so that the maid did be truly in trouble and first she made a threatening that she wear but her olden garments that did be only rags if that i did persist but this i saw to be foolishness and scarce meant and did as much need to smile at her as that i did think to scold her but i did be firm that she wear the cloak and lo she went sudden into crying and this had been beyond my thoughts and truly it set me all adrift for i perceived that she did be greatly distrest concerning this matter when i had conceived that she did but mean this thing for tenderness' sake but mine heart helped me to understand and i saw how she did be truly shamed in her sweet womanhood if that i helped her not in this matter for she did feel that she was made to do hurt unto that one that was her love and this thing i do pray you to think upon that you understand for indeed until that i was made to think i had not seen it thiswise for her and in the end i came to agreement with the maid that we wear the garment hour by hour in turn and she to wear it the first hour and i to wear it the second hour and so to go forward and truly this did be an happy arranging but yet she stampt her foot a little as i put the cloak about her and thrice in the hour did she ask me concerning the time that was gone and surely when the hour was but up she had the cloak off in a moment and went to my back and cast it upon my shoulders and after to my front and made it fast upon my breast and so eager and naughty was she to this that i took her by the shoulders and shook her somewhat even as she had made to stamp at me yet mayhaps with more of laughter and she to take no heed at all but to button the cloak and be very sedate yet in verity i caught her up into mine arms and kissed her for a sweet and naughty maid and she very willing now that she had gotten something of her way but yet in an hour i did have the cloak about her again and so did straiten matters as you shall conceive now when we had gone forward through five great hours i perceived that the maid did be utter worn but yet did make presence that she was unwearied and because i saw how she did be i did heed and be anxious only that we come to some rock to be for our safe refuge and mayhap there to find an hole or cave that should be somewhat to keep our heat about us for there was nowhere any fire hole anigh in all those hours and presently we came to a part where there did be rocks and we went to and fro in the gloom and came in the end to a place where the rocks did go upward into the night as that it had been a small and ancient cliff and surely in a while i found a hole that did go inwards of the rock and the hole did be above mine head yet when i was come to it and had made the diskos to spin therein that i should have light to see whether there did be any creature or creeping thing in the hole i was well pleased for truly it did be sweet and dry now the maid had cried out a little to see the sudden shining that did come from within the hole when i made the diskos to spin and because of the low roar of the weapon but i answered her that there did be naught to have fear concerning and so was she peaceful again but yet a little trembling when that i came down to her for indeed the diskos did make always a strange sounding and a quaint and drear shining as you do know and she did be feared for me that some evil force had come upon me out of the cave for she had neither knowledge nor conceiving that ever there did be so wondrous a weapon in all the world and i gave the maid an help upward to the little cave and came after myself and so we did be in a very nice and cosy place that did not be easily gotten at by any monstrous thing and surely i was utter glad for such a place so that both should have safety that we might sleep in the same hours and in truth this was a needful plan for if one had stayed wakeful to keep a watch for the other then had our sleep taken us double hours and this thing might not be else should our food be done and we to be twice so long as need be ere ever we did come unto the refuge of the mighty pyramid and i utter wearied and anxious of the heart and spirit that i bring mine own soon unto the safety and glory of my mighty home and so free from the destruction that did hang above our two souls for ever in that land and the peril that did be everywhere save in the last redoubt now when we were come into the hole of the rock the maid did slip the scrip and the pouch from my shoulders and she gat out the tablets and made some of the water and did be very swift and natty and all to the despite of the gloom that did be utter in that little cave and we eat each of us two of the tablets and drank some of the water and i made jest with the maid how that the tablets did be proper for strength yet very lacking to fill the belly though indeed i named it otherwise and she to agree and did pat mine arm and did tell me how that she should cook me a monstrous tasty and great meal when that we were come unto the mighty pyramid and immediately afterward she did make to laugh upon me and to name me impudently for so much thought unto my feeding and afterward again to silence and to patting my hand now when that we had made an end of eating and drinking i was very ready for sleep for truly it was six and twenty great hours since that i did last slumber but for the maid it did be eight and thirty great hours for as you do mind she had made no sleeping when that she did lie in mine arms for six hours of our journeying and i made how we should sleep and put the cloak about the maid but surely she did refuse very piteous and seeming to have also somewhat of doubt and puzzlement but in this thing i did be very stern and intending for she did not be over warm clad as you do know and moreover she was but a little one while i did be wondrous hardy and in verity i made her to obey and gave her the scrip and the pouch for her pillow and she as it did seem to me to sob to herself a little in the gloom of the night but yet did i stay my heart a little stern to mine intent and i wrapt the cloak about her and set the scrip and the pouch very nice beneath her head and afterward i knelt over to kiss her before that i came unto mine own slumber yet did she turn her mouth from me and did put her hand above her face to ward me off the which did grieve me for truly i did heed alway that i should never thrust my love upon her in her lonesomeness but only let it be to her for a shield and for all comfort unto her heart and i turned my back and went a pace away and lay down for truly there did be no way else but to be near unto the maid for it was but a little cave and i lay very husht because that i was so sore in the heart yet truly i could not come unto my slumber for i was so disturbed in my love and i stayed very quiet maybe for a great hour and did fight that i shake not mine armour to jinglings with the utter cold that did make me to tremble but the maid did sleep very sweet and calm as i perceived by her breathings yet in verity the maid did be so much awake as i and with some sweet and naughty intent of the heart as my spirit did sudden perceive and i lay very husht and did wait to discover what this thing might be and i made my breathing to seem as the breathing of one that did sleep even as that naughty maid did make pretending and surely in a while i did know that she moved very quiet and came unto me and i made yet that i slept very sound and strong though the cold did nigh to conquer all my quietness and in a moment i perceived the intent of the maid for i did feel the cloak spread over me with a wondrous gentleness and afterward there did be a soft kiss put upon my hand and the maid back then to her pillow yet as i did hear she brought it something more nigh to me as that she did crave to be near unto me that was her own love and i sat up and i put forth my hands suddenly and took the maid into mine arms and she to nestle unto me so that i did be wordless because that i loved her so utter and presently i felt her to stir in mine arms and i loost her somewhat for i did be always very mindful that i impose not upon her dear liberty of maidenhood yet she made not to go from me but only to gather the cloak about her so that we did both be in the cloak and she askt why this might not be for surely it did be madness that one should starve and the other be very nice in warmth and indeed this did be but wisdom yet it might not come the first from me and i said to mine own that this thing should be and she reached out and brought the scrip and the pouch and placed them for a pillow for my head and told me that i should put my head thereon and i askt her how this did be right for she did need a pillow the more than i but she bid me to bide and to have obedience in my turn and when i was so she spread the cloak over me and afterward crept under and did lie down beside me and did seem as that she was asleep in one moment yet though she did be so sedate and matter of the fact as we do say while that she was wakeful she did yet nestle unto me very sweet and childlike in her sleep and surely i did want to kiss her but yet did refrain from my love for truly i did well that i treat her very gently at such a time as you do perceive and in verity such a maid doth make a reverence in the soul of a man now presently i was gone over unto sleep and in seven hours i waked and in that time had the maid slumbered through eight hours yet did i intend that she be not disturbed until that we were aready to the journey and i slipt from under the cloak and put it round her very gentle yet it to be as she did miss me even in her sleep for it to seem to me that she put out her arms in the darkness and she made a little moaning in her slumber yet in a moment she did be quiet and afterward i put the cloak about her again and i went then to the opening of the little cave and put forth my head and lookt well about and harked a long while but there stirred nothing in the night thereabout neither did my spirit wot of any matter for trouble unto us and presently i gat out two of the tablets for as you do know the maid had given me the scrip and the pouch to be my pillow so that i had power to come at these matters without awaking her but for her own part as i did learn after she had used her torn garments to be for a pillow yet had made no explaining as you do mind and surely this was one of her naughty whimsies and mayhap she had been so full of a playful happiness as doth take the heart betimes that she had made a little mystery where there did be no mystery and this but to release her joy and so to say masterful things unto me out of her impudence and afterward had meant that she tell me but yet was gone unto slumber ere that she did mind her yet since that time a new thought hath come unto me that she did mean in the first that she should come into mine arms to sleep and thereby need no pillow but afterward it may hap that she saw with a sudden olden wisdom all in one moment and afterward did act lovingly yet with understanding and so did change from her intent yet with no improperness of modesty but only with a niceness of sense which she did make no talk of but yet did have and surely how oft is a man thus wisely ordered unknowing and to cease from these thinkings and to go forward i eat two of the tablets and afterward made some of the water and lo the fizzing of the water waked the maid and i knew that she reached out very sudden to me but afterward knew in a moment what did make the sound and that i did be up and making ready for the journeying and she gat up in the darkness and said my name and came unto me and kist my forehead in the dark and immediately she ran her hands gently downward of my left arm and when she came to the cup she took it from me and slapt my hand very dainty and afterward i knew that she took a sip from the cup and then did turn that side to me and so gave me to drink and did scold me that i had not waked her to tend to my needs for surely she did be mine own to have her duties to me and after that i had drank she took the cup and did finish it and she gat two of the tablets as i did think and came afterward and sat upon the rock to my side and did nestle somewhat against mine armour and took mine arm and set it about her and so did make to eat but first she put her tablet unto my lips in the dark that i should kiss it and surely this was an olden way of mirdath my beautiful one so that i did be all shaken of the heart and i kist the tablet and immediately she nestled unto me and did begin to eat and truly it was as that eternity had been rolled backward for i had discovered the soul of mine olden love in this dainty maid to my side yet in looks had mirdath been of an utter differing but in verity naani was wondrous lovely but though i to be so stirred i did be silent for my heart was very full of memory and as the maid eat she slipt her fingers between mine curling them softly and surely her fingers did be very little and she stirred mine olden memories again in this thing and surely i was dumb before my memory and presently she put up the second tablet as i did think that i should kiss it and i kist it as before yet ere she did begin again to eat i did wot suddenly that she hid some intent from me and i caught her hand very quick in the dark and her fingers did close upon the tablet very guilty so that i perceived that i had guessed aright and i opened her fingers and i found that there did be but the half of a tablet within her hand and surely she had taken but that one tablet and had given me the one end to kiss and afterward the other so that i should suppose she did eat two proper and complete tablets and i perceived that she had done this thing secretly being minded that if she eat always but one tablet then should i never lack even if that we did be over long coming unto the mighty pyramid and i askt how oft already had she eat but one for two and she confessed in a very quiet voice that this did make the fifth time and i was so angered that i took her hand and whipt it thrice so hard that she had screamed if that she had been any coward and she said nothing to me neither went away and she began again to eat the half of the tablet and did eat it from the other hand as i to be aware because that her left hand did be hurt and she wept not but was very quiet by me and presently i knew that she kist the whipt hand secretly in the dark and afterward i put mine arm again about her and she did be there in it very sober and happy and when she had made an end of the first tablet i gave her the second and she eat it very quiet and content and presently i talked with her and showed her how that this thing did hurt my heart even as she had been hurt that i did be cold garmented the while that she did be warm and i showed her the wickedness that she had done that she did play so foolish with her life and strength and well might she be weak and all a lack yet did i think a little sweet impudence came into her as i told her concerning her wickednesses and i took her then into mine arms and i showed her how that i knew all the unselfishness and wonder of her heart and i kist her and truly her lips did have a lovely glad humbleness as they came unto mine so that it was as that i had not kist her truly until that moment and i made her to promise that she never deceive me in such matter again and indeed she promised but yet with no ready tongue and afterward we made proper for the journey and when we had gotten our gear together i went downward of the rock and gave the maid help to come down and when we did stand at last upon the bottom of the rock i askt naani how she did feel and whether her feet did hurt and she answered that she did be very well and had no soreness in her feet and we went forward then and she close unto me and odd whiles with low speech but more oft with silence because that we did need that we hark alway for any danger or horror and also there did be so utter a silence upon that part of the land which did be the bottom of the olden sea and we eat and drank at the sixth and the twelfth hours and in the fifteenth hour we came upon a great slope of the earth and lo it did be the far side of the sea and we went upward for a long hour and so came to the upward part and did be able once more to look over the greatness of that land xi the homeward way now truly it did seem very light after the horrid and lonesome gloom that did lie all ways in the bottom of the olden sea and i saw that i was come out upon a part of the land that did be surely to the right of that place where i made entry into the sea bed on mine outward going and there did be a great plenty of fire holes so that mine heart was warmed to see them yet did i mind to be wary in coming unto them for as you do know there did so oft be life of this kind and that about these fires and i lookt now down to the maid and she upward to me and did come more anigh to me and truly she did be most wondrous pretty and sweet yet did seem very awearied and pale in the face so that i made blame upon myself that i had overwalked her for in verity i do think that i was so strong and hard as that i had been made from iron and she but a dear and tender maid yet did she refuse that i should so reproach myself and did but stand anigh to me and look at me with eyes that were very beautiful and so i put mine arms about her and kist her and afterward lookt again over the land that i should shape out our further journeying and from that place where i did stand there spread out all before me the blue shining that i had seen from the mouth part of the upward gorge yet did it be a great way off and indeed i should tell you in this place that it was by the glimmering of this shine within the sky of the night that i had steered as we did come across the olden sea bed and truly it was but a broad thing to go toward but yet did serve me in that it told me that i went toward the far side of the sea bed and made not to go all about in blind circles in the night and after that i had considered a while i did know somewhat where the gorge should be and perceived that i should go unto my left but not overmuch for indeed i saw the red shining of the giants' hole that lay at a great space that way and surely i must go so that i missed the place of the giants so much as i might and in the same going come not overnear unto the blue shining that lay before me across all the far part of that country for in verity i mistrusted the place where that shining did be now when i had gained somewhat of knowledge where should be found the mouth of the upward gorge i put mine arm about the maid where she did stand so nigh to me and very husht the while that i had lookt about and i pointed outward over the dark land unto my left and told her that the gorge did be somewhere that way a great distance off yet utter out of my sight and only to be known that it did be somewise there by the things that i did mind of concerning my way after i came into the land now the maid having stood very quiet had lookt all that time about her and so had come to some knowing of the place where she did be in the land for she to know the land someways as you shall think and she askt me how i did mind to go and truly i said so straight as we might but yet so that we come neither too nigh to the shining nor to the great red fire pit of the giants and the maid bade me to look in the way that i did mind to go and i lookt but yet there was nothing save as they did seem certain fire holes that had a green shining about them and she set out unto me then how that there did go a tract of bad gas in that part of the land that should be utter poisonous unto any and this had been well known in the lesser redoubt by the reading of their instruments and where the gas did go there was there a green shining about the fire holes and she showed me how that the place of the gas went a great way unto the north west so that i learned now somewhat how the land did lie as we do say in these days and it was in all the north west that the great blue shining did burn and i askt naani how they named this and she told me by no name save but the shine and mine own made very earnest to warn me regarding the shine and urged that we go no more that wards than should be needful to our lives the which indeed was no wish of mine and her reason to be that the fixed giants did be within the borders of the shine and all hid in the light thereof save when the burning mist did roll this way or that and i took a great heed of this thing and did guess that these fixed giants were somewhat even as the great watchers that were about the mighty pyramid as you do know and immediately i minded me of that utter monstrous face that i did see amid the bright smoke of the shine when that i came first into the land and surely this had been one of the fixed giants that naani told me were forces of great and very horrid evil and i askt mine own how far the place of the gas went across the land and she pointed and made further explaining and in verity in the end i saw not how i should come that way to the mouth of the gorge if that i would keep off wards from the shine yet in a moment naani askt me how i did come across the land when that i searched for her and truly as i showed her i had walked then by a sweet chance or guiding alway upon the far side of the place of the gas and so unto the olden sea bed and was in this way come free of the gas and all unknowing of it and at this telling the maid said that we go downward again into the bed of the olden sea and walk some great hours below the shore but in the way that should take us unto the south west and so until we were come beyond the place of the gas and afterward up again into the land and then to have an utter caution that we escape the watching of the giants who did be ever about the great red fire hole and by this plan very speedy to the entering part of the upward gorge and truly this did be very good and sound and such as i should have planned in a moment for indeed i am not over slow in such matters only the maid did be very eager and quick and it was very sweet to me that she should thus plan for in verity i loved alway the sounding of her voice and to hear her have speech and to plan and think and so to show me the workings of her inward self and her dear qualities and human niceness and to have part and lot alway with me in all things and thinkings and we shaped to this plan that naani made but at that time as you do mind it was somewhat of seventeen hours since last we had slumber and the maid was sore wearied as i did see and i showed to her how that it did be wise that we have our rest very soon and so forward again in new strength and ability and the maid did soon agree with me for indeed she was very weary and we made it that we should venture unto one of the fire holes that lay no great seeming away a little upon our right which was the northward way of that land and we went toward the fire hole and truly it did be further off than we had thought for it was a good hour before that we came anigh to it and indeed it to prove a very great and red glowing shine that went upward into the night out of the hollow place where it did burn among rocks and when we were come near unto it i made a sign to the maid that she be utter husht and i took the diskos from mine hip and went forward before her and afterward to my knees and hands and beckoned backward to mine own that she do likewise and we came this way to the edge of the hollow place where the fire hole did burn and so were able in the end to look downward and truly it was a great fire that burned in the earth in that place yet as i perceived very swift there did seem nowhere any monstrous thing about the fire the which set some peace upon mine heart but yet not overmuch for it was come fresh upon me that we did well to stay afar off from the fires of the land in that it was about the fires that all living things did congregate and i lookt a great time and the maid crept unto mine elbow and lookt with me and afterward we harked very keen into the night but there was nowhere any trouble of the air or of the aether of the land yet i spoke quiet with the maid and showed unto her how that we did well to stay off ward from the fires but truly she was so utter cold and chill that she did beg that we go down by the fire hole even should it be that we stay no more there than should put a warmth through the utter chill of our bodies and in verity i was so bitter cold that i was all weak to go beside the fire yet truly i do think that the shiverings of the maid was that which did force my heart to go against the teachings of my head so that in the end we came down into the hollow and very swift unto the fire now truly it doth seem a strange thing to be so diverse minded as this when that as you do know i had been so long a search for a fire pit and mayhaps you shall perceive the better how my heart and brain did be contrary when that i tell to you now how that i have belief that my spirit did even then be subtly set to warn me and also as all do know it doth be easy to forget this warning and that of experience by which saying i do mean that oft as i had come to know the dangers that did be alway about the fire holes yet when i did be far off from them and mine own broken and a shiver with the chill of the land the danger did seem but a small thing and afar off from my mind and unreal but the cold to be doubly real yet when we did come even unto the fire hole then did come again all about my heart the truth of those dangers that had seemed but a while gone so little and indeed i do hope you perceive me in this thing and how that i strive alway to set unto you the utter truth so that you shall go with me all the way and lend me your nice understanding now when we were come down unto the fire pit i went this way and that among the rocks that did be in the bottom of the hollow so that i should perceive whether there did be any living creature there hid that should mayhap come out unknown to work us harm but indeed i discovered nothing of any greatness yet i saw three snakes and there were beside two scorpion creatures as i did name them that neither went backward from me nor came against me but did bide where i saw them each in an hole of the rock and because i had seen these things i saw that we should not do wise to sleep nigh unto the fire hole for the creeping things did mortally like the heat and should be like to come upon us in our slumber and indeed this did but uphold my caution that we should be well actioned if that we chose some other part to our rest yet as you shall suppose i said naught unto the maid concerning the creeping and the poisonous things for i did mean that she have rest and happiness the while that we did stay beside the fire hole and afterward i should tell her and so she be the more ready to see the properness that we go elsewhere to our sleep but as you to understand if that she not to see wisely and be still intent to the fire hole i should have her to obey for surely she was mine own and i did love her and did mean alway to have her to safety now presently the maid was something warmed and afterward she slipt the scrip from my shoulder and so had food and drink very swift to my need and we sat together and eat and drank and the maid very sweet and quiet as she did begin to eat her second tablet and truly i had knowing that she did remember in all her body that i had whipt her and indeed she did be utter mine and oft as we did eat and drink i lookt this way and that so that no creeping thing should come anigh to us and presently when we had made an end of our food the maid saw that i did look about and she then very swift to catch some of mine unease and to stare over her shoulder and indeed in a little while she saw a snake go among the rocks and she then to be very eager that we find some place that should be secure from creeping things and we to begin then to look for such but in the end we stayed in the hollow for we found a little cave that did be in an upstanding rock of the hollow and the upstanding rock was mayhaps an hundred good feet off from the fire for the hollow was very great and the cave did be a hole that was thrice my height up from the bottom rocks and it was dry and sweet and with no creeping thing within it neither did there be any place to hide such therein and when we were gotten into the hole surely it did be very sweet and cozy for the shine of the fire hole did shine therein and surely we had felt it a very haven but that there was ever the fear of the land upon our hearts and upon mine the more than upon the maid for truly mine own did seem to trust me utter and to seem that she feared not any evil monster but to have surety that i had power to succour her in all ways and truly this trust had been very sweet unto my heart if that i had lacked somewhat of my terror for the safe home going of mine own and we slept that night as we had done before and shared the cloak over us for truly the fire hole made no great warmth unto us yet was it less bitter in that part than in the darkness of the land and by that we had come unto sleep it was twenty good hours since last we had slumber and truly we did be very wearied but yet came unto our rest with our spirits set anxious to harken on danger the while that we did sleep and we slept seven hours and did know suddenly of some matter that had need to waken us and lo in a moment i did wake and the maid in the same instant of time and there was a great screaming and crying out in the night that surely affrighted us both yet did hurt our hearts the more for it did be the utter cryings and terror of poor humans in the night of that land yet might i do naught but only wait that i learn more of the matter for my duty was unto mine own and i had no leave of rashness any more yet as you do suppose i was all shaken to go downward of the rock and afterward to climb out from the hollow that i should give some help unto they that did need help but yet might i not leave the maid and immediately there was a great roaring in one part of the night and again another roaring in another part of the night and lo in a moment the roarings did be answered and the roarings were the sounds of big and husky voices so that it did seem that we harked to men so big as houses that did run and shout in the night and the maid did begin to shake and i put mine arm about her and drew her backward into the hole so that she did be into the shadow and she to tremble like one that was broken in courage for truly she had heard those sounds oft in the night in all the long and dreadful month that she had wandered and indeed i was all shaken in my courage for it did be the shouting of giants that i heard and you do know somewhat of the utter horror and terror that did be alway in the heart that did harken unto those monstrous voices for you do know my tale and there came in a moment a dreadful screaming out in the night and the screaming did be the screaming of a young maid that doth be slain very brutal and my heart sickened because of mine own but my spirit did swell with a strange and utter anger as that it should burst my body and the maid to my side broke into an utter sobbing and the screaming of the maid afar off in the dark did end very sudden but in a moment there did be other screamings in diverse places and the hoarse shoutings of the great men and the thudding of mighty feet that ran this way and that a chase and the cryings of the humans came nearer and the thuddings of the great feet and in verity in a little minute it did seem unto me that the sounds did be right upon the hollow and i crept forward and peered out and i felt the night to be full of people running and immediately there passed by the hollow a clustering of humans that ran ever and screamed and gasped and wept panting as they ran and the shining of the fire hole made them plain seen and clear and they did be both men and women and were but in rags or utter naked and all torn by the rocks and the bushes and did seem indeed as that they had been wild things that did go by so swift and lost and mine heart troubled me with the pain and longing that it did know so that i had gone in a moment after those people but that i should leave mine own and put her to peril and even while that i felt so utter in this thing there came a great thudding of monstrous feet and there ran four great men out of the night and went past the hollow very quick and three did be dull coloured and seeming much haired and brutish but the other did be an horrid white and livid blotched so that it did seem to my spirit that there went by a thing that did be a very man monster filled of unwholesome life and surely they did be gone from out of the shine of the fire in one moment as we do say and again into the night to their dreadful chasing and when the thudding of their feet had gone a long way off over the land i heard them bellowing and afterward a far away screaming that did have a death note in it and i knew that those dreadful brute men did be taking the life from some poor wild humans and afterward there did be the silence again and surely it did come to me with a fierce impatience of sorrow that those people did be without spirit of courage else had they turned them upon the giants and slain them with their hands even if that all had died to compass that slaying for truly they should all die anywise by the giant men and they had died then with somewhat to comfort their hate yet as i do know the peoples of the lesser redoubt had long been born of parents that were starved of the earth current through an hundred thousand years and more and because of this thing they did surely lack somewhat in all ways yet was naani otherwise but this not to prove aught save the rule as we do say now sudden as i stooped very husht and troubled in the mouth of the little cave i knew that mine own sobbed dryly in the back part of the cave and i had gone to comfort her but that in the same moment i saw a naked maid run very swift over the edge of the hollow and did look over her shoulder as she ran and she came to the bottom and crept in under a ledge of rock that did be in that place and she did seem utter worn and gone of the spirit and desperate and i perceived in the same instant why that she did go stealthy and swift in that fashion and to cower as for her very life for there came a squat haired man so broad as a bullock who did come silent down into the hollow looking this way and that even as a wild beast doth peer very sudden and the squat man had instant knowing of the place where the maid did be and ran in upon her with no sound and i paused not but leaped all the great way unto the bottom of the hollow which did be mayhaps twenty good feet and more for mine anger was upon me and i did mean that i save that one though i did be powerless to give succour unto those others and i fell strong upon my feet and had no harm of my limbs for all that the leap did be so high and in that moment before that i had time to save the maid the squat man ript her and she cried out once with a very dreadful scream and was suddenly dead in the hands of the brute man and my heart made my blood to burn with wrath in mine eyes so that i had scarce power in that instant to see the squat man as i ran upon him and the roar of the diskos filled all the hollow as i made it to spin as that it did rage with an anger and to be glut of the man and the man came round upon me and thought mayhaps to deal with me as it had dealt with that poor maid but not all thatwise as you must know and i swung the diskos and it did seem to sing and to cry eager in my hands and i smote at the squat man even as it did leap silent upon me as a tiger doth leap making no sound but i gat not home the blow for the man dropt sudden down upon the hands and the blow went overwards and the brute man caught me by the legs to rip me and i cut quick with the diskos and it did have but one monstrous talon left unto it and immediately it cast me with the other half across the hollow and i fell with mine armour clanging mightily and the diskos did ring like a bell and by the graciousness of all good things i was harmed not by that monster throw but was to my feet in one instant and had not loosed the diskos from my hand and the beast man did be upon me with two quick boundings and i stood up to the man and it made no sound or cry as it came at me and there did a great froth of brute anger and intent come from the mouth of it and the teeth came down on each side of the mouth very great and sharp and i leaped and smote so that my blow should come the more speedy and the diskos took away the head and the shoulder of the squat man and the dead thing knockt me backward with the spring that it had made but it harmed me not greatly yet afterward i did know how sore and bruised i did be in all my body and being and i came back very swift against the man but it did be truly dead and greatly horrid and i went from the dead monster and did go all heart shaken unto the dead maid and i took the torn body of the maid very sorrowful and cast it into the fire hole and i turned me then that i should look unto the cave that i should know that all did be well with mine own and whether she did have seen the horror or be gone into a swoon and lo mine own did run toward me and she had in her hand my belt knife which i did give her before that time to be a weapon for her defence and i perceived that she had come to be mine aid if that i did need such and she did be utter pale yet very steadfast and not seeming to tremble and i made to take her from that place but she went beyond me and lookt at the monstrous bulk of the squat man and was very silent and she came back unto me and still so silent and she stood before me and said no word but my heart knew what she did be thinking for i am not foolish to have lacked to know what did be in her heart though mine effort had not shown itself that way unto me before that moment and i had no pretending of modesty but received with gladness and a strangeness of humbleness the honour that her eyes did give to me for indeed she did be so that she might not give word to her joy of me and her glad respecting the which is so wondrous good unto the heart of all men that do be loving of a dear and honest maid and she said nothing neither then nor afterward but i did be honoured all my life after when that i did anytime mind me of the way that mine own lookt upward at me in those moments and afterward she did need and allow herself to come unto mine arms that i hold her from the trembling of heart which did come to her after that there did be no need for courage for surely we had both seen a very dreadful thing and there was a great horror upon us and i climbed upward again to the little cave and did help naani and when we were come there again we did rest awhile and presently we eat each of us two of the tablets and drank some of the water and indeed we were both utter thirsty and in about an hour after that we had harked very keen a time we came downward again from the cave and had our gear with us and we came up out of the hollow and set forward with a great caution unto the olden sea bed and we came there in two long hours for we went very slow and with constant harkings for the fear of the monstrous men was upon us but there came no harm anigh neither did we perceive any disturbance in the night of the land and we went down an hour into the olden sea bed and did go now the more swift for our fear was something eased from us because that we had come away from that place where we had perceived so great and dread an hunting but yet had we all care about us for the giants surely to be everywhere in that land but yet as i do think they to roam more oft anigh to the fire holes for the humans did surely wander in such parts that they have warmth of the fires and after we had gone downward an hour into the sea bed we turned somewhat unto the south west and went for twelve great hours and did never be any huge space from the shore for it did run that way as you do know and i made to steer by the shinings of the land and with advices from mine own and in the end of the twelfth hour i did count our distance making that we did walk somewhat of a certain speed and by the tellings of the maid we did be surely come beyond the place of the land where the poison gas did lie and by this it did be something after seventeen hours since we did sleep and surely we did be very ready to have rest for we had gone forward strongly and with anxiousness and truly my hurts did be come upon me so that my whole body did ache for the quick fight had been bitter and i had been thrown very hard and brutal and indeed it was wondrous that i had not been all smashed only that the armour did save me and this doth show truly how hard and strong i did be and naani did speak upon this and was oft a wonder and at that time did beg me that i make some rest to cure my hurts for she had not conceived that a man did grow so strong and hardy and in verity the men of the lesser redoubt did be soft made and lacking of grimness as i did perceive both through my reason and from her tellings for they did lack the strong life that doth breed where is the beat of the earth current as we to have in the mighty pyramid and this thing i have said somewise before this time and because that we did be so wearied i said unto naani that we find a place for our slumber and she very willing as i have shown and to counsel me likewise yet did we search about in that gloom for a great hour more and found no cave or hole to give us a safe refuge for our sleep and when that we could not find such i told naani that we should put the boulders together somewhat and so have them about us that we be greatly hid and in truth even as i began to tell her my plan she did have the same words in her mouth so that we caught our little fingers there in the dark of that grim land in the end of the world even as she and i had done oft in the early years before that eternity when that she did be mirdath the beautiful and we did both be silent and after that we had wished very solemn and earnest we said each a name even as lad and maid shall do in this age and so to laughter and kist one the other and truly the world doth seem not to alter in the heart as you shall think and this was what i did find and we set to and gathered together the boulders which did be very plentiful in that part and she carry those that did be thin and flat and i to roll those that did be great and round and i made a place that did be long and narrow and afterward i set the flat stones round the sides that there be no little hole by which any creeping thing should come inward to sting us in our sleep and afterward we gat inside and surely it did be very cozy as we do say but yet not so secure as i did wish only that i could not shift to plan aught better and indeed it should keep off from us any small thing and should be like to save us from any monstrous brute treading upon us but otherwise it did be but a poor affair now we eat two of the tablets each and drank some of the water even as we had done in the sixth and the twelfth hours and afterward we shared the cloak for our slumber and we kist very sedate and loving and charged our spirits that we wake if that any horrid thing should come anigh to us in our sleep and afterward we did be gone very swift to slumbering and suffered no harm and i waked seven hours after and surely i did ache very bitter as i did move my body for the bruisings did be gotten hold of me and i slipt away from the maid very gentle for i had mind that she sleep a while more as i did mean that we make a great journey that day and after i had harked a while and perceived that there was no evil thing anigh i went outward of the stones and i walked to and fore and moved mine arms that i be eased somewhat of the stiffness and ache but surely it did seem that many hours must go ere i should make any speed of travel for i did be all clumsy and slow and nigh to groan with the pain of going and aught that i did and i minded me that i should do somewhat to ease this thing lest that i cause us both to come to an harm by staying over long in that land and i went back into the stones and gat an ointment from the pouch that i did carry and surely the maid did yet sleep and i went outward of the stones again and stript off the armour and all my garments and i rubbed my body with the ointment and surely the pain did be so that i groaned at this time and that but yet must i rub good and strong so that i die not of the cold of the land and beside i was greatly anxious to cure myself and sudden as i did rub very strong and savage and heeding so well as i might that i groan not the maid did speak close beside me and indeed she could see me but dimly and had waked sudden to hear my groaning and i was not to her side and immediately she had thought that some evil thing harmed me and was come in an instant that she be with me and she cared not that i did be naked but was utter in anger that i strove to do this thing alone and with none to aid me and all uncovered to the chill of the land and she ran back into the stones and brought the cloak and put it about me and was so angered that she stampt and had no impudence but rather as that she did be minded to have tears and she sent me back into the sheltering of the stones and gathered mine armour and brought these things after me but the diskos i took in my hand and she took the pot of the ointment from me and made me to lie and she rubbed me very strong and tender and kept me warm with the cloak and surely she was a wise and lovely maid and utter mine own and in the end she askt me how i was and i said that i did be different and she hurried me that i be clothed very quick for she did be sore afraid that i should come to a chill and when i was gotten again into mine armour she came to me and showed me where i did lack wisdom and spoke very straitly and gentle and serious and afterward kist me and gave me my tablets and to sit beside me and we eat and drank and i with a new lovingness unto mine own and she somewhat as that she did mother me but when i put mine arm about her she did be only a maid and we did be thus with but little talk and a great content and afterward we gat our gear together and went from that little refuge that we had made and in a while we did go upward out of the olden sea bed and when we were come again to the top of the shore the which we did in two good hours i lookt over the land a time with mine own anigh to me and i perceived that the great red fire pit of the giants did be no mighty way off unto the south and west and surely in a little moment we saw that there went monstrous figures against the shine of the mighty fire pit and we stoopt unto the earth for it did seem that the light did be like to show us standing there though truly we did be afar off as you perceive yet mayhaps you do share with us the utter horror and distress that those horrid men did cast about the heart and so have a kindly understanding of our fear and over all the land in this place and that there did be the small shining of little fire holes and pits that did be alway red save in that part where the poison gas did lie the which we had now come safe past and beyond the fire holes was the great shine that lay from the west unto the north of all that land and in verity we did need that we steer so that we come not anigh to it neither unto the great red fire pit of the giants neither unto the low volcanoes which were beyond the great red fire pit as you do know and someways unto the mouth of the upward gorge and the way of our journey was between the west and the south west of that land and to be made with cunning and wisdom that we come clear of all unseemly danger unto mine own and i askt her concerning this thing and that of the land and surely she told me so much of terror that i was half in a wonder that ever i did live in the end to come unto her and it was because of the things that she set out to me that i perceived how we must come nowise anigh to the low volcanoes that were upon this side of the mouth of the upward gorge for it had been known alway in the lesser redoubt that there went very horrid men in that part that did be called wolf men but whether there did be any such thing in that age she had no knowing for she told me the things that did be set down in the records and the histories and truly no man of the lesser redoubt had found heart in a thousand great years to make a journeying through the land for the desire of glad and dreadful adventuring such as our young men did be oft set to though it was not all such that went and because there did be no adventuring for so monstrous a space of years there was no certain new knowledge of the land of that age and this thing is plain to you and needing not of many words which do so irk me and naani set out to me how that the shine was conceived to be a land where evil did live for ever and whence came all those forces of evil that did work upon the lesser refuge and afterward she did quiet so that presently i perceived that she did weep to herself because that her memory was all new stirred by my questionings and i took her very gentle into mine arms as we did be there kneeled upon the earth and after that time i askt her no question save as it did be needful to our health and life yet oft did she tell me this thing and that of her knowledge to be for mine help and guiding now we went forward going a space toward the north west so that we come the more clear of the place where did be the great red fire pit of the giants and we journeyed with a care alway that we show not ourselves over plain unto the light that shone over the land from the great pit and oft we did creep a while over this stark place and that and went nimbly amid the bushes that grew oft in great parts and we made six hours this way and did then have pause that we eat and drink and truly it was nine hours since first i did wake yet had we made no pausing because that we were so set to our journeying to come clear of the place where did be the giants and after that we had eat and drunk we went onward again and made now unto the south west for we did heed that we go no more unto the north west because that should bring us over near to the shine and in the fourteenth hour of that day's travel we came to a part where the land dipt downward into a broad valley and surely it did be very dark down there and did be seeming shallow yet truly of a great deepness but we went that way because that it did be a weary long journey to go around the place where the valley did be and the valley had a different darkness from the gloom that went alway in the olden sea bed for the gloom of the sea bed did be ever of a greyness but the gloom of this valley had a greater dark within it yet did the air seem more clear and we went downward three hours into the valley and stopt then that we eat and drink and truly i had not paused then but that mine own did insist for our methods did be like else to go all adrift and we to be lacking of proper strength and this was wisdom of the maid but i to be a little irked like and restless and this mayhap because that my blood did itch me because that it did be so full of the poison of my bruises and it was gone now of seventeen hours since last we did sleep but yet did we be ready to go forward that we come so quick as maybe out of the dark of that valley for there did seem nowheres any fire hole to make a light only that in this place and that there did be a little blue shining as that there burned a strange gas in this part or that now in two hours after the time that we did eat we stopt both of us very sudden for there did be some vague and curious sound in the night and we went very swift to the earth that we be hid and harked but did hear nothing and in a while we to go onward again yet there did be an unease upon our spirits for our spirits did perceive something afar off in the night but yet had we no surety in this matter and we went forward through a great hour more and did pass in that time two places where the blue shining did be and truly it seemed as that a low gas hung to the earth in this part and that and made a slow burning having neither noise nor spurtings but slow as that it did smoulder and be all to shine and luminous and oft there did be a strong smelling of a bitter gas very horrid in the throat and in the end of another hour while that we were a space off from one of those gas shinings there went past us at a distance as it did seem people running in the night as that they did be lost spirits yet with a rustling very soft so that they did be like to be barefoot and i thought mayhap that these did be some of the peoples of the lesser pyramid yet did they be only as that shadows went among the blue shinings and i pondered a moment whether that i send my voice over the valley to question what they did be but yet had caution and harked through the utter silence of the night for i had no surety of aught and surely in that moment that we harked very keen there did be a sound afar off in the night of the land and it was as that we had heard the sound before and in verity our spirits had perceived the sound those two hours back and now our bodies did wot and perceived that we had known it subtly before that moment and the sound was as that something went spinning in the night and a very great terror came upon the maid for she did know the sound and the sound was that which did show that one of the great evil forces of the land did approach and the sound had been known alway in the lesser refuge to show this thing and indeed mine own spirit had been half to know that a power of evil did come through the night but yet was the assurance very terrible for how should i protect mine own and the spinning came toward us and was presently in the valley and it came swiftly across the dark of the valley and my heart was all broken within me because that there had been happiness with us but a little time gone and now there did be our death anigh and mine own gave me the knife that i had given to her meaning that i slay her in the last moment for she did heed even in that moment that she be not gashed horridly by the terror of the diskos and i took the knife and i kist not mine own but stood there very shaken and desperate and gript her fast unto me scarce heeding the hardness of my gripe and alway i lookt unto the way of the coming of the sound and presently did unbare my wrist where the capsule did be and the sound of the thing spinning came anigh across the valley and my heart did dull and my spirit go black with my desperateness because that this thing must be and because that i could nowhere see hope that i should save mine own and of a sudden the maid put up her arms and pulled me downward and kist me once on the lips but i wot not whether i kist her for i did burn with despair and was all adrift in my being yet was there a sharp comfort that mine own dying did be so nigh and the maid stood gently against me so that she did be convenient unto my hand and afterward i remembered this thing and do you pray that you be never to have such a matter on your hearts but indeed there was a wonder in this thing beside the horror so that my memory doth be alway knowing of this wonder and mayhap you do see with me and love mine own also in your hearts and in the moment that the maid stood thus as i have told i perceived sudden that there did be a little glowing in the night and the glowing was pale and horrid and there was no more any sound of the spinning only there did be as it were the trunk of a great tree that did show in the glowing and the trunk of the tree came toward us across the darkness and i turned the maid from the tree and she did flutter a little in my hands as i did know scarce knowing for she perceived that she did be going to die in that moment and i had my body thus between the evil thing and the maid and lo the tree came no more anigh to us but went backward and the pale glowing did fade and the tree no more to be seen and i cried unto the maid very husky that we did live for that the evil power was gone off from us but she answered not and did be heavy against me and i held her and lookt alway about us lest the tree come in upon the other side and as i lookt this way and that i saw naught and afterward in a moment i searched the night above lest that the thing come from above and behold i saw that there abode over us a clear light as it were a clear burning circle above us in the night and my heart did leap with an holy joy and an utter great thankfulness and i was no more in fear of the tree for in verity there fought for our souls one of those sweet powers of goodness that did strive ever to stand between the forces of evil and the spirit of man and this matter have i shown to you before this time and concerning this holy defense i have thought that it should not mayhap to have had so strong a power to save us if that we had shown an over weakness and fear but because that we did rather stand so well as we might to make battle of escape from so dire a destruction and surely this doth seem but a sane thinking unto me but yet without proof and to be said to you only as the shapings of my thoughts and this the chief end of that happening that the holy circle did truly deliver us and burned through twelve great hours above us and by this do i know that the evil power hovered anigh to destroy us all that while for indeed it doth not be proper of reason to suppose that such an utter wondrous thing did be needlessly over us save to be a shield of great and lovely force against a waiting evil thing and surely you do see thiswise with me and truly so soon as my spirit and reason perceived that we did be no more to suffer from the evil thing i remembered that i did know that mine own had swooned and in verity you shall mind how that she did face her death so utter sweet and brave and had given no cry but made quietly to help me in that dreadful moment and did stand brave and gentle to the stroke and so fell into a swoon as you have seen because that she did suffer an hundred deaths as she did stand so brave waiting to be slain for the blow did be so long delayed yet to come in any moment and i gat her to come to unto her life again and i set the lovely tale very swift to ease her and surely with love and warmth and kist her with a great joy and i showed how i did honour her for her good courage and she to weep a little with the ease come so sudden upon her and afterward to kiss me upon the lips an hundred times and to need that she be very safe in mine arms because that i had meant that i do so dread an office to her and surely i do wonder whether you perceive all that did be then in her heart and the holy light that did be over us she did watch with a sweetness of awe and rest did come more great upon her in the heart as she did learn how sure was the seeming of that lovely power to deliver us and presently we made forward again in the valley and did go steadfast and newly loving each to the other and so through twelve great and body weary hours but our hearts could never be done singing within us nor our hands to cease from the hands of the other because that we did so crave each unto the beloved and in the ninth hour a monstrous way off in the dark of the valley there did seem as that there went a far and dreadful screaming in the night and it did be as that our spirits perceived the sound of something spinning in the night yet faint and a great way off but yet had we no surety that we did truly hear the sound of the spinning only we did be so shaken in the heart for truly there was some horror done unto humans downward in the mighty darkness of the valley and to think upon the sound of the spinning was to be in a shaking trouble of the spirit and to bless the quiet and holy light that went above us in all that time and to ache only that it should stay to be to our protecting and surely it did be plain that there were the signs of great forces in that land and three hours after that time when we did hear the far off screaming we were come up over the edge of the valley and did be once more unto such light as did be general in the land and truly it did seem a wondrous lightness after so utter a dark and we did be all exhaust and mine own drew her feet so weary that it was as that she must go no more until we did rest for indeed it was three and thirty hours since last that we had slept and a bitter trouble and work there had been in that space as you do know now we had eat some of the tablets a few hours back as we did walk and had drunk some of the water but had made no rest for we did crave only that we come free of that valley and now it was needful that we rest if but a little time and i minded that we find some place where i should have a hot pool that i be able to bathe naani's feet and surely we came in a while to a hollow place and there did be two dull burning fire holes in this place and a hot bubbling spring the which did seem to be a rare thing in that land so that we were the more fortunate to perceive it and i made mine own to sit with her feet in the hot spring for it was not over hot and did seem pretty natural to my taste as i did prove in the first and also i did search about the hollow lest there be any harmful creature near by and this you will have truly supposed because you do know the methods of my journeying but yet did i not have so much care as did be proper for i was so dull in the mind by reason of my weariness but indeed there came naught to work us any harm and so we came to no suffering through mine aches and dullness and i sat beside the maid and made her to eat a tablet and saw that the cloak did be nice about her and her head to rest against my knee and i laid the palm of my hand to be as a pillow because of the armour to ease the hardness and i eat with the maid and we both drank after and so there came back somewhat of our strength then i took the maid's little feet and rubbed a portion of the ointment from the pot all about them very gentle and constant and so did they be new rested and eased and she presently fit again to the journey for i was strong set that we go quickly hence out of that land and stay no more there to sleep lest we come unto destruction and when we had rested an hour i put the shoes again upon the maid and made them secure and so gat my gear about me and made to the journey and lo as we did leave the hollow i lookt upward unto the holy light and behold it was gone from us and by this thing i supposed that we had come free of instant danger but yet did there be to me a seeming of nakedness and unprotection as you must perceive and because that the light was vanished i was the more set that we come speedy out of the land and we went forward at a strong speed and had the great red fire pit of the giants to our rear unto the left and a mighty way off in the night but yet i did wish it the further and before us was a small ridging up of the dark land as i did judge because that our view of the lights and the shinings was bounded and to our left at a great way the low volcanoes and somewhat to our right across all that part of the land went the cold and horrid glare of the shine now in a little while i felt that the ground did be sloped upward before us a little and by this thing i saw that i had known aright for that there did be a ridge that hid the land somewise over unto the part where i lookt to find the mouth of the upward gorge and we went up this slope at a strong pace because that i was so eager that i find where we did be in nearness unto the mouth of the upward gorge and surely i was something forgetful in mine eagerness and came somewhat ahead of mine own who did make to hide from me that she did begin to lag because that her new strength was near gone from her and sudden there did be a very dreadful cry to my back and i came round in one instant so quick as a light doth flash for it was the voice of mine own and all my being did suddenly burn with fear that kindled through me in a moment of thought and lo mine own did struggle terribly with a yellow thing which i perceived to be a man with four arms and the man had two arms about the maid and with two did make to choke her unto death for she cried out no more and i came unto the man with a quick leaping and stopt not to pluck the diskos from my hip and surely i did be very strong and mine anger and rage to make me monstrous for i caught the two upper arms of the man and brought them backward in an instant so fierce and savage and so wrencht upon them that i brake them in the shoulders of the man and the man roared and shriekt even as a wild and dreadful beast should cry out and came round upon me with the two lower arms and surely it was a mighty and brutish thing and so broad and bulkt as an ox and the lower arms were huge and greatly haired and the fingers of the hands did have the nails grown into horrid talons as that they should grip very bitter and it caught me by the thighs to rip me upward as i did fear but yet this did not be the intent of the man for in a moment it caught me round the body and on the instant i gat the man by the great throat and the throat did be haired and so great as the neck of a bull and i strove with mine armoured hands that i choke the man and surely i made it to suffer great trouble yet i could not harm it in the life and so i did be an horrid minute and fought with the beast with no more than the strength of my body and it was as that an human went with his hands to slay a monster so strong as an horse and the breath of the man beast came at me and did sicken me and i held the face off from me for i had died with horror if that it had come more anigh and surely the mouth of the man was small and shaped so that i knew that it did never eat of aught that it did slay but to drink as a vampire and in truth i did mean that i chop the man to pieces if that i have chance to the diskos and i did sway this way and that as we did struggle and surely it was as that the man had never made to use the lower arms save to hold unto prey the while that it did use the upper arms to strangle as i do think for all that weary minute of the fight the man made not to loose from me that it should tear my hands from their grip to the throat but made vain waggings with the arms that i brake as that it would use these to the attack but surely they had no more power to do hurt and sudden it put forth an utter power about my body so that mine armour did be like to crack and truly i had died in a moment but for the strongness of the armour and the man hugged me thus for an horrid time the while that i did hold off from me the brutish face and gript very savage into the haired throat and lo the creature did work slow in the brain and in the end loost from me abrupt and went back with a leap so that my hands did be ript from the throat of the beast and in one instant it did be back unto me and gave me no moment to free the diskos but i made anew to fight and shaped as i had learned in the exercises of mine upbringing for truly i had been alway deep in practice of such matters and i slipt from the great hands of the man as it did try to take me by the head and i hit the man with mine armoured fist and put a great power and skill to the blow and i went instant to the side with a swift stepping and evaded the man and i smote the man again and took him very savage in the neck but all the while grown very cold and brutal and cruel for i was set to the slaying and the man beast came round on me and lo i slipt the gripe of the great hands and my body and my legs and mine arms did work together unto that last blow so that i did hit so hard as a great hammer and i gat the beast in the throat and the beast went backward to the earth even as it did think to hold me and lo in a moment i was free and i pluckt forth the diskos from my hip and the yellow beast man grunted upon the ground and it rose up again to come at me and it stood and did grunt and did seem as that it was gone mazed for it did make other sounds and an horrid screeching so that truly by the way of it i conceived that it cried out unknown and half shapen words at me and in a moment it came again at me but i cut the head from the beast man that was in verity an horrid monster and the man died and was quiet upon the earth and truly in that moment the distress of mine efforts and mine utter tiredness and the ache of the bruises took me so that i do surely think i rockt as i stood but yet was my head strong to think and my heart set in anxiousness for i wotted not how great an hurt had been done upon mine own and i ran to her and came to where she did be upon the ground and surely she was all huddled and had her hands very piteous to her throat that did be so pretty and it did shake me in that moment that she was truly slain for she was gone so utter still and as that she did be broken unto death and i took her hands from her throat and surely it did be a little torn yet not to be much or so that it should loose her of her dear life and i strove that i steady the trembling of my hands and i gat free of mine armoured gloves and made that i feel whether her throat did be deadly hurt and in verity it seemed not so only that my hands did so shake because that i was so frightened for mine own and because that i was but new come from the battle and because of this i had not power of touch to assure me i made then that i quieten my breath which did yet come very full and laboured and i put mine ear above the heart of the maid and lo her heart did beat and the horridness of my fear went from me in a moment and i had the scrip from my back very speedy and some of the water to fizz and i dashed the water upon her face and upon her throat and surely there did be a little quivering and an answering of her body and i strove with her for a while more and she came unto her life again and in the first she was all a lack as you may think and immediately she began that she remembered and she then to shake and i told her how that the four armed man was surely dead and could harm her no more and she then to weep because that she had been put to such shock and horror and held by so brutish a thing but i took her into mine arms and so she did come presently to an ease and i perceived in all my being that she was as a little ship that doth lie in harbour for she did cling and nestle unto me and did be safe with me in all her heart and body and belief and surely she was mine own and i to have glory in that knowing and presently i put her from mine arms to lie yet so that she might not perceive the body of the yellow beast man and i made clean the diskos from her sight and afterward i put on the scrip and i took the maid to mine arms again and had the diskos in my hand beside her and she made protest that she should truly walk for that i was all a weary and she come to her strength again and indeed i carried her a certain way and did then put her down to her feet and truly her knees did so tremble that she had not stood let be to walk and i caught her up again and i kist her and i told her that i did be surely her master in verity and she mine own baby slave and truly you shall not laugh upon me for i was so human as any and a man doth talk this way with his maid and she did be quiet and sweet and to obey wisely for she was gone very weak and thiswise we did go and i to say loving words in the first but afterward i did heed more of my going now that she was something eased and at rest within mine arms and i did peer everywhere about lest that some other evil thing come outward of the bushes to have at us ere i did ware and truly the bushes grew here and there in that place very plentiful in great dumpings and presently i was come to the top part of the ridge and lo a great gladness took me and some amazement for there did be the lights that did be in the mouth of the upward gorge and they did show me that i was come anigh to that place yet had i feared that we were surely a dozen great miles off and now i to learn that we did be scarce of two or maybe three as i did judge and i told this thing to the maid and she rejoiced in mine arms with a deep and quiet thankfulness and i set forward then at so good a pace as i might and i was come into the mouth part of the upward gorge in about an hour and surely i did be very weary for it was beyond six and thirty hours that we had gone since last we did sleep and there had been sore labour and terror to our share in that time as i have told and i turned in the mouth of the gorge and told mine own very gentle that we did take our last look upon that land and she askt that i put her down to her feet and i put her down and therewith we stood in that place and mine arm about her and so did i support the maid the while that she lookt silent over the dark of the land and presently she askt me in a very husht voice whether that i knew where the lesser pyramid did be in all that darkness for she was all adrift of her bearings and was as a stranger because that she had never lookt upon the land from that place before then and i showed her where i thought the pyramid to stand hid in the everlasting night and she nodded very quiet as that she did think thatwise also and so a time did pass and i knew that naani said good bye forever unto all that she had known of the world in all her life and she did be whispering a goodbye in her soul unto her dead and i was very husht and deeply sorrowful for the maid and did understand for in verity there should no other human look upon that land of terror through all the quiet of eternity and the maid did lose all her young life into that blackness and the father that was her father and the grave of her mother and the friends of all her years and there went death in the land even then after those that did live and mine own shook a little within mine arm so that i knew she strove that she be brave to weep not but afterward she made not to cease from her tears and truly i was there to be her understanding and she did be sweet and natural ever with me for she was mine own and did be hourly the more so and presently i moved a little to sign that we go downward of the gorge and she stayed me one moment that she look once more over all that land and afterward she submitted and turned with me and did break into very bitter sobbing as she did go stumbling beside me for the sorrow of memory did fill her and she was truly a very lonesome maid in that moment and had come through much dreadfulness and in a minute i stoopt and lifted her and she wept in mine arms against mine armour and i very silent and tender with her and carried her downward of the gorge for a great hour more and presently she was grown calm and i knew that she slept in mine arms and in thiswise we made farewell of that dark land and left it unto eternity xii downward of the gorge now i carried the maid an hour downward of the gorge as i did say and i was then grown so weary that i near fell as i walked and stumbled everywhile because that i had lost somewhat of guiding in my feet the which did show mine utter alackness and i saw that i must come very swift to a place for slumber or that i did be like to fall headlong with the maid for i nigh slept as i walkt and i began that i give attention to the sides of the gorge and surely i had gone that hour all in a dream for i was fresh waked as it were in that i did give my will to perceive aught and when i did come to have power to attend i knew that i had gone even as a sleep walker for the gorge did seem a fresh matter unto me and as that i had come awake sudden to find myself a walk in that strange and narrow place and presently i saw somewhat where i did be for i minded the memory of mine outward journey and truly i have a good power to know and remember a way that i have gone and i saw that there was a great and ruddy fire hole anigh to me and i was all sure that i had perceived certain caves in the wall of the gorge near to that fire as i past it on mine upward way and i had been given a mighty longing of heart at that time that it be given to me that i should bring safe mine own out of the peril that beset her and have her unto just such a place for her slumber on the way of our journey backward and surely i tell you this thing as a child in pleasure for truly it was a wondrous happy matter that my desiring should be like to have a true ending as indeed it did seem was truly to be if that my memory had set me aright and i went onward somewhat and lo i to be right for the little caves did be there a little past the great fire hole and there were seven of them in the left side of the great cliff of the gorge and one did be as that it were very cozy and a place of sure safety if that we could win unto it and truly as i did conceive we had come safe from the evil forces of that land but yet did i mind that there was no surety in this thing and neither did i know but that some monster should come downward of the gorge out of that land and so work our deaths as we did sleep if that we have no sure place for our slumber and indeed i had wished that we were come a greater way downward of the gorge but this might not be for i was all adrift with weariness and truly if that we gat upward to the top most cave there did be few monsters that should have power to come at us ere we be warned of their coming and afterward they should be like to come upward against the diskos and this should be indeed a thing difficult as you shall conceive now it did be needful that i wake the maid and i kist her as she did be in mine arms and surely that dear one did kiss back again in her sleep and was yet asleep and truly i did love her with all my being and i kist her again and shook her very gentle and so had her to wakefulness and told how we did be come to a place fit for our slumber and she to look about very sleepy as i set her to her feet and then to upbraid herself that she did over to slumber the while that i did labour with her carrying and in verity i kist her again as she did stand making to steady herself and looking so pretty with the sleep that did lie yet in her eyes and she to kiss me very dear and all mine and even then scarce proper come to wakefulness and did say with something of a little dear abandon that she did love me utter and forever and afterward i climbed to the topmost of the caves and told mine own the while that she walk up and down a little so that she come to a full awakedness and this i was careful to because that she should have a need of all her powers that she come safe upward unto the cave and when i was come to the cave lo it did be so sweet and dry as did make glad my heart and there did be a warmth in the cave as that there went a fire somewhere through the rocks anigh and the light from the fire hole did make a reflection inward and so this did seem a place safe and fit to our slumbering and i came downward unto naani calling that the cave was very proper for our use and presently i gave her mine aid to the climbing and so we came in the end safe into the cave and truly we did feel very safe and happy yet before we did sleep i set free the scrip and the pouch and took the straps and went downward again into the gorge and i gat a good boulder so heavy as i might carry and strapt it to my back and came upward again to the cave and the maid very grave and anxious lest that i slip to my hurt and when i was come to the cave again i set the boulder in the mouth of the cave and did balance it so light upon the edge that a touch should send it rolling downward and by this devising i conceived that any beast or monstrous thing that should climb upward whilst that we slept should be like to set the rock adrift and mayhaps the rock to work an harm to such but the chief end to be that i should be swiftly waked by the noise and then i did turn that we go to our slumber and lo the maid had spread the cloak upon the rock that we should sleep upon it for truly there did be no need that we have it now to our covering because that the cave did be so warm as i have told before and surely there did be no cause either that i should have the cloak for a bed for how should i perceive any softness from the cloak through all the sternness of mine armour but yet did i see that the maid had made a couch that should be for the two of us and did be so sweet and natural and to lie by me but yet to preserve her sweet modesty and to do the thing with no thought save that it was natural to our hearts and that she did long alway to be anigh to me but yet mayhaps scarce full conscious that her heart did prompt her in this thing and in verity i loved her very dear and surely naani showed me the where that i should lie upon my side and when i had obeyed she kneeled and kist me on the lips very sober and loving and she lay down then upon the cloak beside me and truly we had both gone to sleep in one little minute as i do think now i did be waked twelve great hours after by the fizzing of the water and lo when i lookt the maid was not beside me but did make ready our simple eating and drinking and she laughed at me very sweet and tender because that she loved me so and did be so glad to have me awake to her and she came over to me and kist me very bright and loving upon the lips and after that she had kist me she kneeled beside me and lookt at me very dear and tender so that i knew in a moment that she had waked a while gone and watched me somewise motherlike as i did sleep but how i knew this thing i am not sure save that my spirit did know or that her thoughts did have tongues unto mine and truly i needed that i be so loved and all of you to say like with me and i put up mine arms to her as i did yet lie and she not to deny me but came into mine arms and did snuggle there so sweet and happy and gladly and with so true a delight that it did be plain how she did love in all her body and spirit to be anigh to me as i to her yet truly as you do mind the armour did be upon me so that i feared to take her very strong in mine arms lest i hurt the dear maid and surely the armour did be a stern matter for her to nestle unto but yet mayhaps did the sternness something please her womanheart and yet again mayhaps to lack and presently she made that she would go from me and i loosed mine arms from her very ready because that i did heed alway that she have full sweet liberty of her dear maidenhood and i to be watchful sufficient unto this end yet always honest and wholesome and not over pondering even in this my care and this proper intending you shall ever perceive if that your hearts do strive to hearken unto my heart which doth speak alway before you and the maid went from me over to where she had put the cup of the water and the tablets and i to make to rise that i look that the boulder did be safe untouched in the mouth of the cave but she called unto me that i lie backward for that she did mean gently to spoil me that once and that i have no heed to the boulder or whether there did be any monster or beast anigh in the gorge for that the boulder did be safe as i did balance it and nowheres any creature to sight in the gorge for she had lookt oft since waking to this end and truly i obeyed and lay back and did like that i should be spoilt as we do say and naani brought the cup of the water and the tablets over to me for she gat them from the scrip before i had it to my pillow in that while when i had gone downward for the boulder and surely even when she brought the cup she would not have me to rise but took my head upon her knees and kist me once very dainty on the lips and i very happy to be so loved and wishful no otherwise and she took a tablet and kist it and gave it to me and afterward touched another to my lips and had that to be for her own and so we eat and were very glad and happy someways as children are happy and our hearts all at ease and presently we eat each our second tablet in the same wise as the first and truly i did be kist more than once and afterward we drank each of the water and when we had made an end naani told me that i move to stand and surely i wondered and i stood up and lo i near cried out with the pains of my bruisings for i was all gone stiff in my sleep and as that i did be more sore than ever and this to be because i had fought again as you do know and surely had been hurt more by the four armed man than i had known and i perceived then that naani had supposed that i should be thus pained and had given dear thought to the matter and truly she had the pot of the ointment ready if that i did be very bad that she rub me and she gave me aid with mine armour and afterward eased me with my garments and surely i did be utter bruised in the body by reason of the violence of the yellow beast man and the maid had somewhat so tender and sweet in her eyes as she looked upon the bruisings that i did be very happy and to glow with contentment and she had me to lie and made me in comfort with the cloak so loving and grave so that i was as a child that doth be cared of by his mother and she did rub me very skilful and gentle for a great hour until i was all refreshed and in verity she was a lovely wise maid and as the maid ministered unto me i lay alway very restful and harked to the low sound of the muttering of the fire hole that did be in the bottom of the gorge and alway i did feel as an happy child that doth be clothed in love and guided in wisdom and presently when that the maid had ended her dear care she put by the ointment and gave me her hands very dainty that she mean to aid me to rise and surely when i was come again to my feet i was all eased and to have movement with no great pain and truly this made me wondrous pleased and to feel new couraged for i had been troubled that i should be so helpless in that i did be the protector of mine own and when i had tried my limbs and found them to be in command and ready i lookt about for my garments and lo the maid brought me my spare body vest from the pouch and had it upon her arm to give to me but surely she denied me a moment of the vest and stood before me and had an admiring and wonder very sweet and honest because that my arms did be so great and hard with muscles and indeed i did be very strong as you have perceived for i did be alway in affection of the exercises that were taught in the upbringing of all the peoples of the mighty pyramid and by this explaining you shall understand that i was like to be strong but indeed i owed the straightness and shaping of my body to the mother that bore me and afterward in all my life had i taken pride of my body to be of health and to have strength and surely this is a matter very fit for pride and to be told bravely and with honesty and the admiring of the maid was very sweet to me and in verity i did be to deceive if that i said otherwise and in a moment she dropt my body vest and put out her hands to me that i take her into mine arms and i took the maid into mine arms with a great gladness and with somewhat of humbleness that i was nowise good enough to hold her for my heart was young and i loved her very dear and youthful and she did lie there very quiet and happy a little and surely i did find presently that she kist the great muscling of my breast very sweet and sly where her face did be press against it and lo in a moment she came free of mine arms and gave me an aid with my garments and afterward with mine armour and when that this was done she stood off from me and she lookt at me half shy and half of sweetness and naughtiness and she came then in a moment and put her hands upward to my shoulders and so stood her eyelids something down over her eyes and did steal a little look up this time and that and lo in a sudden moment before i did wot she was to her knees before me and did weep and i down very swift to kneel with her and i askt not why she wept for i perceived that she did have joy and glad happiness and sweet trouble of her man and that she did be a true woman and one part of the woman did worship so that she did be strangely humble and nigh to be shy and another did love and need that she be anigh to me and a third to have a calm wisdom and all did now be a tremble together in her heart and i knew that i did be truly an hero to her though but usual to all others and my heart was wondrous proud and wondrous humble so that i was in the same moment upraised and to feel dreadly unworthy but i made no pretending to discredit myself to her but only did resolve that i win alway her dear respect and i did be natural and truthful of my manner and without foolish denial of her sweet worship for she was utter mine own and it did be a pitiful thing if that i seem otherwise than an hero unto her but of you i ask kind understanding and to call me not a thing of conceit because that i did understand for truly i knew my faults even so well as you that do know all of my going and you to look backward upon the love days and to mind how that your maid did ever to make you great in manhood with her dear belief and uplooking and so shall you conceive of all my feelings for we do be all so human in this matter and to meet on a dear natural ground as you will say and truly in a little time mine own did be steadied and wiped her pretty eyes and nestled to me a while very husht and to need that she be close and i to have her gentle against mine armour and to be in my heart as that i did be her father and her lover in the one man and surely to be silent and joyful that i lived and presently i slipt her shoes from her little feet with my right hand the while that she did rest within my left arm and i condemned myself that i had thought not more swift to this end but indeed i had thought upon it while that naani rubbed me and had intention thiswise but afterward forgat as you shall understand that have been with me alway and truly mine own did be hurt that i say aught to my blame and i to cease but yet to feel reproached by my heart and when i had lookt to the maid's feet i tied on her shoes again and we gat together our gear and afterward we came down from the cave with a great care because that it did be so high up in the cliff of the gorge and afterward we made downward of the gorge and had a good care to our going and so much of speed as we could make that we come something off from the dark land of the lesser redoubt so quick as we might and in six hours we had gone very well and we stopt then that we eat and drink and afterward i lookt again to the feet of the maid and i bathed them in a great rock basin of warm water that did be anigh to the place of our eating and afterward i put the ointment about them very thorough and gentle and for a good while and so she had some ease and comfort and afterward we made onward again but now we did go pretty easy for i had considered the notings of mine outward journey and so did perceive that we should be but six or seven hours off that part of the gorge where did be the slugs and i was minded that we rest and sleep ere that we make through that dire and dreadful place for that we should be twelve great hours and more to go through and to have no rest or pause until that we did be safe outward again as you shall think and so did we need to be strong and well rested and this to be wise also for the feet of the maid now surely the maid did be in delight of the fires of that part of the gorge where we were come and she had beside a rest of the soul in that she had feeling that there did be no evil force to trouble us to our destruction and i bothered her not yet awhile with tellings of the horrid place that we should to journey through in a while as you do know and so we did go and alway with a good caution lest that some beast or creature should come upon us and alway with the fire holes before and behind and in the air of the gorge the little whistlings of steam that did spirt out in this place and that and a good warmth in many parts by reason of the fires and odd whiles a smelling of sulphur but not greatly nor to our trouble and alway the low muttering of the fire holes and pits and the red lights and the dancing of the shadows when that we did go by a fire pit where the fire did frisk and burn lively and upon either side the grim walls of the gorge going up measureless into the night and so we were gone presently pretty comfortable for six good hours since last that we eat and we made halt and eat and drank and i showed the maid how that we should make a short journey that day and sleep and so be ready to the horrid journey through the dark part of the gorge where the slugs did be and we made search then that we have a safe place to our slumber and surely i perceived where we did be for we came upon that same cave where i did sleep after that i was come free of the slugs and that we were come no farther doth show how easy did be our present going and this you do know and there did be the spring where i washed and the fire hole anigh and truly they were not like to be gone away as you shall say yet did we exclaim very natural for the maid did be so deep in interest of the matters of my coming and to be at once that no other place should serve for our rest and slumber and indeed this was a natural thing and the place so good as any save that i did wish it had been upward unto a high place of the gorge as you shall understand but yet might we block the mouth part of the cave with boulders somewise as i did before and so to have a defence against any thing that should make to enter upon our sleep or at the least to be waked by the falling of the boulders now mine own went inward of the little cave which did be very light from the fire pit that was to the front but before that she did go i made a swift search of the place that there should be no creeping thing and truly it was sweet and free and the maid did be strangely taken that she should come to the veritable place where once i did lie on mine outward way and truly i do understand and so shall many that do have these feelings about matters and afterward we went unto the hot spring that was in the hollow of the rock anigh to the fire pit and i saw that there did be no snakes neither any of the rat things anigh and so i had the maid to sit very comfortable on the side of the pool and i freed her shoes and bathed her feet and afterward rubbed them very steady with the ointment and so for a good time and alway to keep a looking out upon the gorge and presently when that i had taken a loving care of her pretty feet i tied the shoes again upon the maid and so back to the cave and the two of us to carry boulders according to our strength and when we had a sufficient we builded a rough and clumsy wall after that we were gone into the cave and the wall rose nigh to fill the mouth of the cave and made us to be somewise in darkness but yet to feel in safety and i had a good heed to make the chinks of the wall very close in the bottom so that no small creeping thing should come through unto us whilst that we slept and afterward naani set the scrip and the pouch to be for my pillow but had the bundle of her torn garments to be for her own purpose and i perceived that she had the water powder and a pack of the tablets to her hand for our waking that she might prepare our food and mayhap to wake a little before me so that she have all ready to greet me from my sleep but indeed i said naught to show that i knew for i saw that this thing did give her a dear pleasure and truly it was very sweet to have her to these gentle duties that did be to her so sure and quiet a delight and mine own bade me that i lie and she put the diskos upon the outward side of me to mine hand and with a dainty and fearful touch for the weapon did be very dreadful unto her thoughts but yet a comforting thing to abide for our defence and afterward she covered me with the cloak and kist me very sedate upon the lips and then to her own side and to come very nice and happy under the cloak and so to her rest and presently she did sleep as i perceived by her breathings and surely it did seem to my spirit that she had an utter and dear content in this arranging of our slumber so that she did be all at peace in all her being because that she did be nigh unto me that did be her own love but indeed i could not sleep for a time and surely in a while mine own did nestle unto me in her sleep so sweet and dear as a child and likewise as that it did be her right to be so anigh unto me and i to be that i should put mine arms about her but indeed i moved not neither did i kiss her as i did wish for truly i should be very manly with mine own maid that did be so trustful and utter mine in her sleep and presently i was over unto slumber also and stirred not for eight good hours and did wake then to the hissing of the water so that i knew mine own was awake before me as she had planned and was making ready that we eat and when she saw me move in the half light she gave out a little word of joy that i did be again to knowledge of her and she came over and put her arms about my neck and kist me very loving thrice upon the lips and in verity it came to me in that moment that i had been kist a while gone in my dreams but scarce to know it yet i perceived now that mine own had taken a naughty advantaging of my slumber that she kiss me to her own pleasure yet did the maid say no word of her naughtiness and i to be likewise but to resolve that i waken mayhaps on the next time and so catch her in her sweet and secret delight of me and truly this doth sound quaint but to be true and i rose and took down the half of the wall that did be across the mouth of the cave and afterward lookt out but there was no sight of any horrid thing in the gorge save that one of the rat things did slumber very gorged seeming upon the side of the little fire hole and afterwards we eat and drank and the maid then to rub me as before for i was greatly stiff on my waking as you shall think but she came not into mine arms presently as i did hope but only kist my shoulders when that she had finished and so bid me to dress yet after that i was drest and had mine armour full upon me she must come unto me and she slipt her two small hands into the one of mine and so stood by me very silent and sudden she put up her lips very quiet and passionate that i should kiss her and she kist me once as it did be as that her spirit kist mine and all her being came unto me and she gave me but that one kiss and afterward slipt her hands very gentle from mine and made to the gathering of our gear but truly i that loved her so great knew that a tumult of love did be hid in her heart and indeed she looked once at me in such wise that i grew near to a true humbleness of heart because of the honour and love that did be in her eyes and surely it is a very little thing to die for such an one as mine own did be and by this saying shall you perceive my heart in that moment and that i did pant as it were that i do some deed of love to show my love and truly this is but a natural desiring and human and the cause proper to the uplifting of manhood and surely you shall all mind you of such feelings in the past love days that i do pray should be never past and when we had our gear together i left it in the cave and took mine own over unto the hot pool that was anigh to the fire pit and she to exclaim upon the rat thing that did be yet a slumber upon the side of the fire pit and i to say that the thing did be no cause for fear but rather indeed a good friend in that it was a devourer of snakes as you shall mind and while that we talked i bathed the little feet of naani and surely as i dried them upon my pocket cloth i was taken that i should kiss them and surely i kist them and they did be very shapely and dainty and all eased of travel by the care that i did take to this end and afterward i rubbed them with the ointment for a good while and so had them again into the shoes and the maid very quiet after that i had kist her feet that did be so dainty but yet with a sweet naughtiness in her way as my heart perceived though she did nothing neither said anything to this end and was truly very obedient and orderly to all my wishes and we went back then to the cave and the maid put the pot of the ointment back into the pouch and she buckled the pouch and the scrip upon me and the diskos i had upon my hip for i went nowise anywhere without it as you shall suppose and she had the little bundle of her clothing for her burden and truly i was ready that she should carry so much for we did be to act wisely and she well able to carry so small a thing and i better to have my hands alway free to the diskos and to the needs of the way and we went downward of the gorge at a strong speed for there did be somewise of fifteen hours good journey ere that we come out upon the far side of that place where the monsters did be and this did be three hours to the upward beginning of that place and twelve hours journey then in the least that we should take to go through again into the light of the gorge below and this i did reckon from my notings of mine upward journey as you do know and i made all clear to the maid of the thing that did be before us and made not to hide the danger and horror but yet to make not overmuch of the same and she to walk close beside me very sweet and trustful and to say that she feared naught so that i should be there to have care of her but only that she did fear harm for me and yet to have confidence that i should slay all hurtful things that should be like to trouble us and truly i did kiss her for her dear belief and love now in the middle part of the third hour the air of the gorge did begin that it was heavy and to have a seeming of fumes that stang something upon the throat odd whiles and there were presently less of the fire holes and soon as we did go the more downward the beginnings of a great gloom and to have smoke therein that made us to feel husky and in the end of the fourth hour we were come truly far downward within the gloom and to be as that we groped in a fog of distaste and to know not how we went with any surety for oft there did be an utter darkness about us and awhile the shine of a dull glowing fire pit upon our sight that did show us the gloom and dread of that place and we went alway very husht and the maid to my back but i did halt now and this time and make to know how she did be and surely she whispered very brave to me through the dimness and once did slip her hand into mine and i to take off mine armoured glove for a little moment that i hold her hand and give her nice assurance but in verity there was terror in mine heart that did be a terror far beyond the trouble of mine upward way and surely i was shaken newly with every danger lest that i should lose mine own or she to come to any hurt and indeed you shall perceive how i did be for so should you be in a like case and in truth it doth be an utter anxiousness and suffering now when we had been two hours in the dark part of the gorge i smelled of the dread and horrid stink that you do wot of and surely a great fear came upon me for i perceived that we did come among the monsters or that one came anigh to us and i whispered unto the maid that she halt and we stood very husht a while and surely the stink did grow and to be very dreadful in the nostrils so that i felt mine own maid to shake somewhat with the fear and disgust that this thing did make in us and presently the stinking did ease somewhat from about us but whether there had gone past us a monster slug i have no sure knowing for there did be no fire pit anigh to that place so that there was a great darkness all about and surely there was a great slowness and wetness of the air and dismal drippings that made desolation in the silence and the feel of strange growths upon the boulders as you do know and oft an horrid slime and dankness and the stink to be everywhere so that we knew a constant disgust and fear and alway the fumings of sulphur that did seem in verity to beat down upon us utter heavy and sore upon our lungs and so went we onward amid the smell that did be as of dead things and oft did we make pause and hark and had a great care as we did go by the dull fire holes and fire pits that we should make no showing of ourselves in the light and sudden as we did go by a great pit that burned very deep and red i reached back and caught mine own by the arm and i set her gaze unto the right side of the gorge which was beyond the fire and the maid went very still as she did see the thing that was there for in verity it was utter monstrous and did shine very wet looking in the light of the fire and truly it moved a little with the head this way and that stretching through the dark and the shadows as you shall see a slug to move and with no speed or sound and nowise seeming heedful of aught but yet did i fear that it smelled us if this might be and this as you shall think to be a very natural fear and alway as i do mind it seemed to go blindly somewise or to have that slow and strange moving that doth make one to think of a blindness but whether it did be truly blind how shall i say only that it was an utter monstrous brute so great as the black hull of a ship and very dreadful unto our hearts and we moved not for a while save that i pulled mine own down into the hiding of the boulders of that part and she to put her hand very anxious unto me yet not to be comforted as i did half to think but to persuade me lest that i go to some adventuring that should set me in a surer danger and this i perceived in a little moment and loved her for her care but indeed i had no mind to aught save that we come clear of that place and i watched the monster through places between the boulders and surely in a little while it swayed the great head very slow and quiet unto the cliff that did make that side of the gorge and the brute set unto the cliff and began that it went upward with a strange moving of muscles that did go wavewise under the wet and horrid gleaming hide and so in a little time it was gone quiet against the cliff and the head part did be upward in the darkness above so that it did be from our sight but the monster body did be plain for a great way and was seeming clung to the cliff and to come downward out of the dark as that it did be a great black ridge of soft and dreadful life upon the face of the cliff and the tail was something less bulked and to taper and did trail outward into the gorge upon the boulders and surely the thing did seem as that it slept but that odd whiles the tail did lift a little off the boulders and curl somewise and afterward come down again upon the boulders mayhap in this place and mayhap in that place as we did watch all hid and it was as that our sense and our spirits did assure us that the thing had no wotting of us but surely our fears did nigh to equal the comfort of this sweet reason and to make us think otherwise yet in a time i made that we go forward together through the spaces that did be among the boulders and i went creeping and the maid to follow likewise and oft i did pause and made a watching upon the monster but truly it moved not save as i have told and i kept a great heed upon the maid that she follow alway close unto my feet and in the end we came safe from that place where the monster did be clung unto the great cliff in the night and we went then for two great hours without adventure save that once the maid touched me that we pause for that something went by us where we did be in an utter dark place of the gorge and no fire hole anigh and i knew that the thing did be near even as the maid toucht me and caught i the maid in the dark and thrust her under the side of a boulder and i crouched then before her with mine armour that i should protect her from any brutish thing and the diskos in my hand and afterward an horrid time of waiting and the stink of that part of the gorge grew very dreadful so that it did be as that we should not breathe with the horror of the stink and there went past us some horrid and utter monster that made neither sound nor anything save that there seemed a strange noise that might be the breathing of a great thing but yet did be all uncertain in that the sides of the gorge cast the sound this way and that in an horrid whispering of echoes so that we did not know whether the sound be made nigh to us or afar upward in the eternity of the night where i did suppose the mountains to be joined over the gorge in a monstrous roof in that part and presently the strange noisings died in the upward height and all about us and the utter disgust of the stink went from us so that we knew that the monster had gone past us and did make downward through the dark gorge and mayhap then to some lone and dreadful cavern of the world as i did think and indeed as i do mind i had a sudden wonder at that time and other whiles as it did chance whether this way did be truly the olden way that the peoples of the lesser refuge did travel in the olden days and surely as i did suppose they had come some other way or the gorge to be different and less dreadful in the far off years and this thing you shall agree with me to be a reasonable thinking and after that the monster had gone a good while we went onward again and with a great caution and dreading alway lest that we come upon that monster in the darkness but yet did we know by smell and by all our consciousness whether that we came nigh unto one of the monster slugs then in the end of the fifth hour in the dark part of the gorge we came by the mouth of that great cavern upon our left and you to remember the same and i made pause in the darkness and had the maid very gentle by the arm that she should look with me and i whispered how that i past this place to my right upon mine upward way and how that i did think there to be a plenty of monster caverns within the mountains that made the sides of the gorge and that mayhap the slug creatures had there an home in such places or came up it might be from some utter strange deepness and mystery of the great world and the maid did bide very close unto me and silent whilst that i whispered for the terror of the place did be on her yet not to make her lacking of courage but yet to put a monstrous awe upon her and a great and natural fear and i likewise as you do know and we stayed there where we did be a little moment and looked downward into the bowels of the monster cavern and the shine of the fire hole beat over the cavern in the near part but there did be an utter mystery and deathly dark beyond the shining of the pit that did be within as you shall remember and in verity as we stayed but to glance i perceived that there lay humped things about the fire and some to be black seeming and some to have a seeming of whiteness but with no sureness in the colour to mine eyes and there came a moving in one of the humpt things so that it did be as that an hill did wake unto an horrid life and immediately i knew that the humps did be some utter monsters mayhaps even the great slugs a slumber about the fire pit that did burn in that strange deeply cavern and i saw that i did ill for our lives that i should pause even for a little moment to such staring and immediately i whispered to mine own that we go with all our speed for indeed i knew not whether that our nearness had waked that monster or whether that it had but waked by chance and truly i was utter eager that we be gone from that place so swift as we might and we went on then through all of the sixth hour that we did be in the slug part of the gorge as i named it unto myself and in all that hour there did nothing harmful come anigh only as i did know presently there came an unease upon our spirits but yet to be very little at that time and we to be scarce knowing of it and alway as we went there did be darkness for the most and odd whiles a vague murmuring of the night far above as it did seem and presently the dull glare of a fire pit to shine out far off below us in the gorge and to seem very dim and unreal unto us by reason of the smokes and the fumes that made a haze and a distaste in the gorge and presently the murmuring of the night to grow somewhat and afterward the sound of the muttering of the fire pit to come unto us and the murmuring to die unto our ears that did be hearing now only the dull muttering and so we to know that the murmuring of the night did be truly the far off muttering of the fire holes and our eyes to guide our hearing and our reason to explain and knit the sounds and so we to pass by the fire hole with a great quiet and caution and ever with watchfulness as you shall suppose and afterward again into the dark and presently again the murmuring to tell that we came unto another of the fire pits that was yet afar off in the gorge and made dim echoes in the night and alway we went very watchful and in grim fear but with steadfastness and good intention to win forth out of that desolation and horror and having alway so great a speed as the darkness and the dangers and the trouble of the way did allow and in this place i will make explanation why that i speak somewhiles of fire pits and otherwhiles of fire holes for the holes did be those fires that burned nigh to the brim of the holes but the pits were those places where the fire was deeply in the earth and this thing i give for your enlightenment even on a small matter so that you shall have a clear knowledge to abide with me all the way and you to agree of this for wisdom and i to be pleased that you so agree and here also i should tell that there did not come a muttering from all of the fire holes and the fire pits but mayhap from this one and mayhap not from that one according to the way of the fire therein and this shall be plain unto you and so shall you see us go and the smoke and the bitterness of the sulphur to be all about us and oddwhiles the murmuring of a far off pit and oft the utter silence and to pass this time a lonesome fire hole and afterward the utter dark or the half gloom all as might chance according to the nearness of the fires and upward in the everlasting night the grim mountains to make a roof over us as i did suppose and all this while did the unease of which i have told make upon us so that presently mine own whispered unto me the thing that already my spirit did half to perceive that there came after us through the night some harmful thing that did be surely no great way off as i did feel within me and the maid to have a likeways belief and truly i thought at once upon that brute that did wake downward in the mighty cavern where did be the great inward fire hole as i have told but whether this did be true knowledge that we did be chased in the dark by that thing or whether there came after us some other monster i could have no sureness but only that we did be chased and of this i had assuredness and i set the maid before me that i have myself ready to the danger that followed and we made forward again then so quick as we were abled and she went very wisely for she had good wit and had noted the ways of my leading and we went thus until the end of the seventh hour and surely in that time we heard the murmuring in the night which told of a fire hole somewise before us and soon to have the red glare plain to our eyes and the noise of the murmuring to die away into the nearer mutter of the fire and so presently to be anigh and we to make forward with a good speed because that we feared utterly the thing that made quiet chase of us through the night and oft i did look backward and smelt the air that i know whether it did be a monster slug beast that chased us but there did be no worseness of the smell to tell me aught and alway i did be fretted in the heart that we could make no greater speed but indeed as you shall perceive our going did be but a slow thing in the dark places and even thus we had many a sore tumbling and bruising and by this we were come almost unto the fire hole and immediately i saw that i knew the place for there went upward beside the fire a great jaggedness of rock that i had seen upon mine upward way and surely i caught the maid in an instant and bent her and she quick to obey with her body and we were both immediately hid downward among the boulders and this i did because i minded how that there did be many of the monsters nigh to this same fire hole as i did go upon mine upward way and we went forward then with an utter care but yet to keep onward because that there did be somewhat in chase of us and in verity when that we were come opposite unto the fire hole i saw that there did be seven of the monster slugs against the far side of the gorge and did be all set upon their bellies against the cliff and their horrid heads to be hid in the upward dark and their tails to lie very great and soft seeming in the bottom of the gorge upon the boulders and lo the maid toucht me and she drew me to look upon the near cliff of the gorge and truly there did be three of the brutish things laid upward there and a fourth did be humped somewhat upon a great ledge that did be upward of the gorge and just to be plain to our eyes and surely it was as that we did be all surround by such monsters and to make the heart sink and fear to lie upon our hopefulness but indeed the maid showed a good spirit and i to have fierce determining that we come free of that gorge and afterward in time unto our mighty home and we made forward again and did go creeping among the rocks and the boulders and so came presently past that place and had not waked the monsters if that indeed they did truly sleep and i made halt a moment upon the far border of the light from the fire hole and i lookt backward up the gorge perchance that i should see the thing that followed us but indeed there came nothing out of the dark of the upward gorge so that i knew that there did be some safe space to our backs which did be truly a comforting thing and here i should tell how that there was no great stinking in that place where did be so many of the slug beasts and this to puzzle me and in the end to make me think that some of those horrid things did stench more great than others but yet i to have no certainty in this matter as you do perceive and truly this thing troubled me for i had been comforted that my nose should tell me when that the thing that made chase of us should draw nigh in the darkness and now in verity i knew not what to have for assurance for the awaredness of the spirit was but a vague thing and no more in such a matter than a feeling as of an inward warning and we went onward then for a great hour and with an horrid unease upon us and thrice we did go by fire pits in the darkness and alway i made pause upon the far side of the light that i should look backward but did have no sight of aught yet did my spirit or my fears warn me with new fear and a greater sense of nearness and the maid to confess also to this thing now we saw not any of the slugs for a long while neither had there been any about the three fire holes and the air of the gorge was grown something sweet and free somewhat of the stench of dead seeming things but yet to be very bitter with fumings and smoke and sulphur stinks and lo in the middle of the tenth hour as we did go painful and with anxiousness in a very dark place of the gorge there came unto us again the smell that told to us that one of the monsters did be anigh and surely we had both a great fear in that we had belief that it did be a sign that the thing that made chase did draw near upon us but yet did i to use my reason also and to know that the stink might be from some monster that we were come nigh to in the darkness of that place and i whispered this unto the maid and she to say very husht that it might be so but to have no belief and i to be likewise as you do see and we pusht forward at a new speed and had many bitter falls so that we did be all bruised but not to know it at that time because that our fear did be so keen and oft we made a little pause and harkt but there did be only the dismal drip of water from on high and presently the murmur of the night that told that we drew near unto a new firepit and surely this was a great easement to our spirits in that we should have light to perceive our danger and mayhap to win free but to be in that utter dark was a thing to break the courage and to breed belief that we did be utter helpless and all wrapt in horror and despair and the stink grew ever as we made forward so that i knew not whether there did be great monsters beside the fire pit that was to our front as i have told or whether it made plain the advancing of the pursuer and we only to be able to make our best speed and to be weary with hope that we rush not blind into death and alway to be chilled in the back with the belief that the thing that made chase did be very close in that utter dark and to gain upon us and we knew not whether to make our belief to be the tellings of the spirit or the utterings of our fears and so shall you perceive our plight and we but to be able to make forward and in verity the dreadfulness of that time doth shake me now to think upon and you also if that you have gotten my tellings to your hearts so that your human sympathy doth be with me and there came presently to our ears the far mutter of the fire pit so that very soon the murmuring was lost to us in the night and only the slow mutter to be plain and the dull looming of the fire shone afar off through the night and the smoke and fumings and we to a great speed and to pant with fear but yet with a freshness of hope again to sweeten us and we came nigh to the fire pit and lo the smell did be grown very drear and foul but there did be no slug beast near the fire and by this we perceived that we did be truly in an utter danger in that the pursuer did be upon us and the stinking to tell this to be truth and our spirits to have warned us very strong and proper and i stopt near to the fire pit which did be great and very red glowing and i lookt upward of the gorge into the night of the gorge that we did come from but the monster was not yet upon us to work our death and i lookt to the sides of the gorge and the maid to have the same thought that did be mine that we climb the mountains that made the sides of the gorge and i lookt very keen first to this side and then did run overward that i look more close upon the other and afterward back again for it did seem that we should have a greater ease upon the side that we did be and i askt the maid whether that she did be prepared and she to be very white and wearied and all besmirched with the dankness and growths upon the boulders and the hidden pools of the gorge and the dripping of the waters but yet did she be sound in her courage and to show that she had all belief and abiding in me and her judgement likewise to be with mine in that her own reason did approve and i took the bundle of her torn clothing from her for it did be at her girdle and like to trouble her movings but she to refuse very determined in that i did be already over burdened and i to be firm in my deciding and to make her to yield the bundle the which i hookt unto the hold of the diskos where it did be to mine hip and the maid to be there a little figure and white in the face and strangely angered and her anger mixt with hidden acknowledgement that i did be her master and half to be minded that she move not from where she did stand and part to be reasonable and fearful of the hidden beast and in part also to thrill in her womanhood unto the man that did be so masterful unto her and all to pass in a little moment and we to be to the gorge side and busied very eager to the climb and the maid to be first as i did heed and i to follow and have constant looking to the task and to her safety and alway to be bitter anxious for our speed to be good and to be anxious the more then lest that mine own should slip for there did be an horrid wetness upon the sides of the gorge as you shall have guessed and horrid growths that blotched the great rocks mightily and made an utter slipperiness if that they did be trod upon and we to have to come so clear of all such matters as we might and yet to be speedy for our lives and likewise to lack no care and thought to the setting of our hands and of our feet in places fitted to the lifting of our weight and truly you shall see that we went very desperate and i to give word to the maid that she look not downward the which i was urgent upon lest that she come giddy in the heart but i as you shall think could scarce to keep from fearful peerings below so that i learn speedy whether the pursuer did come yet into the light of the fire hole beneath and presently the maid did gasp very weak and troubled with the soreness of the climb and i came higher and set mine arm about her as we did be there upon the face of the cliff and she stopt very still a little while and an ease did come to her and an assurance of safety and surely i kist her there where we did be in that upward place and her lips did tremble unto mine and her courage and strength to come back into her so that in a minute she did make once more to the climbing and we came presently to a place where a great ledge did be that jutted out from the mighty cliff and was surely a huge way above the gorge bottom and the ledge sloped and there were on the ledge great stones and boulders that did make lodgement there through eternity and i lookt very careful to our way and saw that we did be in the path of a mighty rock that was over nigh unto the edge of the shelf place and did put fear upon me in that it seemed that it should come down with great thundering upon us if that we but shook the place where it did be and i caught the maid very swift and gentle and shaped our path unto one side of that great rock and did presently lose my fear when that we did come safe from under it and in a minute after we were come upward upon the ledge and a very safe place it did seem and surely as that no monster should be abled to come upward upon us and this i did try to make for comfort unto ourselves but that we both to know how that the great slugs could lie up against the sides of the gorge and surely it did be like that they should be able to come upward clear of the gorge and so to the place where we made to have safety and i had no thought to deny this thing when that it was clear to my brain but set rather that we should have some way to fight the monster if that we did be discovered and i thought in a moment upon the stones that did be about and the maid in the same moment cried out that we should push the big rock down upon the slug that we believed to have chase of us and indeed the rock to be a great weapon if we could but stir it as you shall think and alway as we talked very hushed we lookt downward into the deepness of the gorge unto the upward end of the fire light but there came no thing yet unto our knowledge only that the stinking did rise up to us through that great distance and the fire pit to seem now a very small burning and to give no great light up to us and we neither to be abled to see very clear of the gorge bottom in that the haze of the fumes and the smoke was in the air of the gorge and made uncertainty and we to be nowise proper free of the smoke even where we did be and we watched very set with anxiousness and fearful expecting of the monster and did be both yet lost of breath and the maid that she made her words something broken for a little while and lo in a moment naani cried out very low and sharp that the thing did come and i to see a moving of somewhat in the same instant in the gorge that lay upon the upward side of the fire pit and immediately i saw the great and monster head of the beast come forward into the shine from the pit and the head did be of a blotched white and to have the eyes upon great stalks that came from the forward part of the head and the stalks to be set downward so that the eyes lookt upon the bottom parts of the gorge and surely this doth be very horrid seeming to the mind of this age but yet to have a less strangeness unto the two of us that had seen many horrid sights as you do know and as the monster came forward the more into the light i saw that the great and utter mighty bulk did be all of that same whiteness that did be so set over with blotchings and a seeming of unhealth but truly the colour was proper to a creature that did abide in so great a darkness as you shall say yet had those slugs that we did see been black and shining for the most as i have told and this to be as i saw and i not to heed here that i try unto explainings in this place else should i be never eased of my task as you do see and the monster slug came onward and as it did go it set the stalks of the eyes in among the boulders as that it did search swayed now this way and now that way from side to side of the gorge and alway it pushed the stalks of the eyes inward among the boulders and so to go forward searching and truly it was very dreadful to see the thing make search for us and to go so steadfast to so dread a purpose and indeed i saw it not so plain as might be because of the haze of the fumes and the smoke that did lie in the air of the gorge as i have told and made something vague the sight at this time and that but yet we did both see a strange thing for when that the great white body did be come half into the light the slug beast set out a big tongue among the boulders after that it did peer thereunder and the tongue did be very long and white and something thin seeming and the monster lapped inward in a moment a great snake from among the boulders and the tongue did hold upon the snake as that there did be surely teeth or roughness upon the tongue but yet the distance to be too great for any surety of the sight as you do know and moreover there did be the uncertainty of the haze within the air and the slug took the snake inward all as it did lash and wriggle and swallowed it in a moment and in verity that snake did be a big and horrid creature else had it been not so plain to our sight but it did be as a worm unto the monster and gone instant and immediately the slug beast went again to searching and the head to sway from this side unto that side of the gorge and by the wideness and ease of this swaying shall you perceive the utter greatness of the beast and alway as it did come downward of the gorge it thrust the stalks of the eyes inward among the boulders looking all ways and oft the breath did come from it as a cloud and the stink to rise up unto us very plain and an abomination and again we saw the beast set the tongue in among the boulders of the gorge bottom and it lickt forth a snake that did seem so thick as a man in the body and the snake to thrash in the great white tongue and to be immediately drawn inward and gone utter and surely as the thought did stir in me there did be a great mercy over us in that we did not die by such a serpent in some dark and horrid place of the gorge but yet as it is like to be mayhap the snakes did be only anigh to the fire holes yet doth it be anywise a wondrous thing that we had come so free of them alway and truly to learn was to be given a new terror now the monster was come fully into the shining of the fire pit and was upon this side and the fire to make a shining against the side of the slug so that odd whiles i did perceive very plain the huge wrinklings and musclings of the skin as the beast made onward and alway it did search thrusting in the eye stalks among the boulders and sudden it made pause and did begin that it brought all the mighty body together and humpt itself and brought the head part round unto the bottom of the cliff that made this side of the gorge and it gathered itself and afterward did lengthen upward against the cliff and begin to climb and lo i saw that the beast did scent of us and made to come upward to destroy us and as the mighty hill of the body did come into length against the great cliff side the beast set the eye stalks into this cave and that as it did go and into all crannies and so lengthened upward very straight and monstrous and dreadful unto us and did be as a white and mildewed hill that had an horrid life and the stink to come up so that we did be like to lose our breath with the dreadfulness of it as you shall think and surely for a moment i looked unto the rocks upon the ledge and this way and that way and upward unto the everlasting darkness that did be above us and again unto the great rock that did seem to quiver upon the edge as i have told and i was grown utter desperate in a moment for truly it did seem in that instant that there did be no power in the world that should slay so utter mighty a monster and immediately even as i did despair i had run very swift unto the great rock and the maid with me both very strained and shaken with the horror of the thing that did make upward unto us so sure and intent and i set my strength unto the rock and heaved but indeed the rock gave not from the place where it did be so that i had a dreadful despair for i saw that it did be more secure than had seemed and the maid lent her strength unto mine and we heaved together with sore pantings and little cries to guide our endeavours and because we could not be contained in that moment and surely it seemed that the great rock moved and lo as we strove together to the task there came a vast and sudden grinding and the rock to cease from our shoulders and to be gone from us or scarce we did wot of the happening and the rock went over and rushed downward upon the monster and with mighty crashings as it did grind and crush the face of the cliff side with a quick and constant thundering and i caught the maid as she did stagger upon that dire upward edge because that she had set her strength so utter to the endeavour and the rock to be gone so sudden as you do see and she to be like to follow after and she clung unto me and i to hold her very safe as i lookt down upon the falling of the rock and behold the great rock smote the monster in the humpt part of the back below of the head and did enter into the monster even as a bullet doth strike and was gone instant from my sight into the vitals and there came a mighty sound of anguish from the monster and the monster did loosen from the cliff and to crumple as it did seem and sink backward and a great steam of dread breathing to go upward from the beast and a reek and it made again the strange and horrid noise of pain and the gorge to be yet full of the echoes of the rock thundering and with the noise of the rock there was now mingled the horrid sounding of the death crying of the beast and the gorge to be filled with dull and dreadful echoings as that an hundred monsters died in this place and that of the darkness in the gorge and all to be bred of the noise of that mildewed hill a dying and the echoes ceased not for a while even after that the monster did be utter quiet for truly they came presently from far upward and downward of the gorge out of all the eternity of the night and to be as that they came backward very faint out of lonesome miles and out of the strange deepness of unknown caverns of the world and so in the end to silence and the far bottom of the gorge to be filled with a white and horrid hill very dreadful and that did yet quiver to show the slowness of death and alway a dreadful reek and stinking to fill all the air even unto the height as of the grave and i stood upward in that far high place and held the maid very strong and tender and she to have covered her ears from that dreadful crying and to be yet shaken with the greatness and horror of the dying of the monster and the nearness that she did come unto falling as you have seen and presently she came less to tremble and did weep very easeful even as a babe doth weep and i mayhap to be not over steady as you shall think but yet to have a great gladness set in my heart and a triumph and an utter grace of thankfulness and i held mine own very tender and sure as i did say and she very soon to be eased of her trouble and the shock to be something gone from her and she lookt up at me and slipt her arms upward about my neck and pulled me downward unto her that she might kiss me and we to talk then of the going down and surely this did seem a great and dangerous task for truly we had come upward pretty easy in the excess of our fear but how we might go down with our blood cool i did be all in doubt yet before that we did aught else i led the maid upward on to the safe part of the ledge and we sat there very quiet and weary and she did be leaned against me and we eat each of us two of the tablets and i to scold and coax mine own to this end and she to obey and to be better afterward because that she had eat and we drank some of the water and did rest a time longer and presently our courage and strength was come back into us and we packt the scrip again and the maid set it fast to my back and we went then to the edge of the shelf and lookt downward this way and that and surely there did be no way to go save the way we came only that we might shape our downward climbing to bring us a little below that place where the dead monster did be and i saw by mine own heart and by the paleness of the maid that we should do well that we consider the thing no more but make to the task and i went immediately over the edge of the shelf upon my belly and i bade naani to follow and we began then that we go downward and in verity we went downward for mayhap a great hour and i gave help alway unto mine own as i could and she to come after me very brave and made that she hold back her fear and come downward of that cliff that did be oft like to a mighty wall and surely even as we came down i marvelled how we did ever go upward even though fear did aid us but indeed i do think it doth be easier to climb safely than to come backward for this is how i have found and we made rest thrice upon ledges of the cliff and afterward came downward again and alway very slow and with exceeding heed where our hands and our feet did go that we slip not suddenly to our death and once as i did see the maid was lost of all her strength and did be going to fall because that she did be all gone into a sudden weakness of the head in an instant and she did be silent even in that moment the which doth be marvellous unto me and to give me a strong pride of her as you shall understand if that ever you have loved and surely i came upward in a moment that little space that was between and had mine arm about mine own very swift and held her hard and fierce against the cliff and this i did that she should feel how that she could never fall and immediately her strength and her dear courage came back into her and i kist her there against the mighty cliff and afterward she did have power again to come downward safe and presently we were come to the gorge bottom and maybe an hundred paces down the gorge from that place where did be the dead monster all sunk into an ugly and horrid heap so great as a small hill and a dreadful stinking did hang in all that part of the gorge by reason of the slug and signs of disgust as you shall think and the great and mildewed body of the thing yet to settle and twitch as i did look as it did come properly unto death in all that mighty bulk and everywhere the skin of the beast did be set into great wrinklings and horrid blotchings to be upon the improper whiteness thereof and truly i did be in haste that i turn the maid away from that thing and that we haste downward of the gorge and we went then for two good hours and alway i did hearten the maid and she to go very husht and trustful by me but truly i did be in an anguish of heart because that i was newly aware that there did be such great and dreadful serpents in that part of the gorge as you do also know and i was not over feared for myself but for the maid that did have no armour to protect her dear body and because that i was so set with this trouble i took the maid presently into mine arms that i carry her and so to have her clear of aught that should lie among the boulders and in verity mine own did show an anger very surprising and determined for i said not why i should carry her fearing to give her a greater unease but only that she did be weary and i very strong and willing and indeed i could not bring her to reason without i told her which was not mine intent for she did refuse me to carry her and said that truly i had need of no added burden unto my labours and when she saw that i would not be moved by her reasonings she made to win upon me by her loving ways but indeed i only kist her and went forward with her in mine arms and she half naughty that i did be so heedless of her wishings and somewise hurt also and so to be silent in mine arms yet mayhap to be something stirred in her nature that i did be steadfast to mine intention despite that her will did be contrary and this i do believe to be truth because that afterward i do think that she lay there in mine arms only as a woman that doth be in the hands of her master that hath all her love and in thiswise we went forward and in the end of the two hours that we did go there was come the end of the dark part of the gorge and we to be outward of that mighty roof of the mountains as i do think it to have been and the air to be free of the stink of the monsters and the fire holes to be very plenty and their smokings to go upward very proper so that we had no more the bitterness of their fumings in our throats and there did be a pretty good light to go by the contrast of the past hours and i set mine own again to her feet and made that she keep to my rearward so that if there did be any serpents to our path they should come first under my feet and thiswise to work no harm to me because of mine armour neither to naani mine own maid now by this time it was somewhat of nineteen great hours since we did sleep for we had been a long while making that we come safe from the slug and indeed we had come downward with a less speed than i did go through upon mine upward way as you shall mind and this to be that mine own did not have the hard strength that was in my body to the enduring of great labour and stress and this surely all to be plain unto you that have been with me in all my journey and moreover there must be kept to mind the three hours that we had gone ere we were come proper into the dark part of the gorge and so all to be remembered unto you and also you to mind that we did be wakeful a time ere that we set forward upon that day's journeying and we did go almost in joyous wise because that we were come safe out of that dreadful place and surely odd whiles i did feel the hands of mine own naughty one to be hookt very pretty and sly into the backward part of my belt as that she did make a pretending that she drive me before her and surely this doth be a strange thing to tell upon for there did be no knowledge of the olden horse in all the eternity of that dark world but yet maybe some dear olden memory dream did set her hands unconscious to this pretty work and in verity once i turned very sudden and had her swift into mine arms as she did pretend to drive me and she to laugh with a sweet and joyous gurgle against mine armour and i to heed that i hurt her not because i did be like an iron man that should put arms about a tender maid and we lookt alway now for a place that should be proper to our rest and to our sleep and when it did be close upon the end of the twentieth hour of that journey the maid showed me a cave that was mayhap fifty good feet upward in the right side of the gorge and i lookt about and saw that there did be two fire holes anigh and a warm spring to make a basin of water that did lie between the fires and all very well set to our need as i did perceive for indeed we did be utter besmirched with the filth of the slug part of the gorge and to need that we be nice and fitly washed before that we have any comfort of our selves and i bade naani to wait a little minute and i lookt well up the gorge and well down the gorge and lo there did be no thing to set me in unease and i told mine own that she keep a sharp and steadfast watching and not to heed me and this i said because i knew she did be like otherwise to look at me and be over anxious as i go upward to the cave and indeed she to be better anyway in watch of the gorge and to cry out to me if that anything came anigh whilst that i went upward and i made upward to the cave and was come there pretty quick and truly it did be good for our purpose and fresh seeming and dry and to have no holes that i could see for the hiding of creeping things and i called down gently to the maid that the cave did be proper and she to show her gladness and to be looking upward at me instead of the way of the gorge as i set her and truly she did be a dear and human little maid and utter mine so that i did find a new joy in each small lack of wisdom and this just so much as that she had done a wondrous proper thing and truly you shall say there was some properness to her heart in that she could abide not but to watch me and i went quickly down to mine own for there was alway an unease upon me save when i did be nigh to her in chance of trouble and when i was come down to her the maid did be seeming a little in thought and afterward showed me how that she did be all in a pitiful disgust of the dirt and slime and the drippings of the gorge that did be on her and had made her garment utter wet and bemired so that she did feel that her very body was a repulse unto her and i saw how it did be with naani and i went to the warm pool and felt that it did be not over hot and afterward found the deepness by the handle of the diskos and this to be scarce of three feet and the water very clear to show me the bottom so that it was surely a nice and proper place to be for such a purpose as i did think and i set some of the water to my mouth using my hand and truly there did seem no hurtful chemical in the water and therefore was i eased that the maid should have the desire that i did see to be in her mind and i saw that i should be helpful to mine own if that i make the arranging of things to be in mine own hands and i went back unto the maid and told her that the pool was very nice to be for a bath place and that she to haste to wash herself whilst the gorge did be free of any creature or monster now i saw that naani was troubled and feared that i did be going to leave her and yet did be paused a little in her words to show me all that she did wish and surely i stoopt and kist her as she did look so wistful in her little puzzlement and immediately i removed her trouble very natural and told that i should stand guard anigh to her the while that she bathed and truly she did be at ease on the moment and mayhap something surprised to know wherefore she had been something a lack to ask me but in truth it did be very natural and i told her to be so quick as she might which was a needless thing to say yet to start her and she to go quietly to obey me but first to take the cloak out of the hold upon my shoulders and to unfold it and so to the pool and i to stand with my back thatwards and to lean ready upon the diskos and presently she did be in the water as i knew and i to be her man very sure and gentle to her and sedate and truly as you shall think i did love that i be to stand guard to her in her dear maidenhood and she after that she was cheered and warmed by the delight of the water to sing very low and happy to herself where she did be to my back and sudden the singing to cease and the maid screamed and i to have no thought of improper modesty but turned instant to the maid and in a moment i saw what did trouble her for there came a serpent out of the water and the maid to be all adrift with natural modesty and with her fear of the serpent and i was come into the pool in a moment in mine armour and did lift the maid naked and wet into mine arms and had her instant from the water and upon the side of the pool and there i wrapt the cloak about her and ran very quick and killed the serpent as it did go offwards among the boulders and surely it did be so thick as mine arm and to have come from some hole that did be hid in the bottom of the pool and i came back then to mine own and took her into mine arms and set the cloak well about her and she to cry and to tremble with the shock and disturbance of the thing but soon to be eased and ready to laugh with me and so she was come proper to her happiness again and i very gentle and joyous with her for truly my heart had been sick that she had come so nigh to that horrid danger and i eased the scrip from me and opened it and made her to take two of the tablets and she to refuse to eat save i company her also and indeed i did be very willing for truly my belly was alway empty and she to be very glad to eat because she did be clean now and to have no more disgust of herself and afterward we drank some of the water and soon we did be finished and she to ask for her girdle that i did give her with the knife as i have surely told and she belted the cloak very graceful about her and lookt very dear and pretty with her little bare feet and her hair very lovely upon her shoulders for she did wear alway in the gorge the lining of my head piece and so had her hair dry and sweet and in verity i did mind now how that she did look very beautiful in her bath as i had gone to succour her from the snake and i to be nicely wholesome in this remembering because of my love but yet to be knowing that i was sweetly stirred to new things and did not know before that a maid lookt in the same moment so holy and so human and afterward in odd whiles i remembered but never to think overmuch because that i did feel inwardly that i should be gently wise in such things and you to understand my heart in this if that ever you have loved and surely the maid brought me from my dreamings very sensible in that she had me to stand and she was gone about me very swift and natty with her pretty fingers that she ease me of mine armour and afterward she bade me to strip and wash whilst that she keep watch for me of the gorge and she took the diskos and leaned upon it very brave and proper but yet as i do think with somewhat of roguishness within her very deep hid and scarce known unto herself and i warned her to be very wise with the great weapon for it did fit only to fight in my hands and did be like to cause harm to any that should meddle with it or make to use it save me and naani to nod that she did hear me and to be half in fear of the thing and half to feel that it did be friendly to her and so to stand guard for me and truly to seem a very sweet and slender maid despite the bigness of the cloak and the great weapon to seem more great in her small hands and to mind me how strong i did be and surely you shall think me in conceit but truly i did be glad to be so strong and a proper thing for pride if that there be no scorn for others therein and you to agree with me in this thing or to be lacking of sympathy and good human understanding now i washt me not by going down into the pool for indeed i did not wot whether there be any more snakes hid there in some other hole and the way i washt was that i dipt my head piece into the hot pool and poured the water over me and rubbed my body very strong with my hands and there to be surely some certain chemical in the water that aided mine efforts for the water went very smooth under my hands and when i was done i washt my pocket cloth very speedy in the pool and wrung it and did then wipe my body so dry as i should and afterward i wrung the cloth again and set it about my loins and so to be as proper as i might and i did call to the maid that i was proper and she to come then and kiss me and she gave back to me the diskos and set me that i stand anigh to the nearer fire hole and so to be that i should guard her and in the same time be come free of the chill of the gorge which was not great in that place and surely i did mean that i help her but she would have no help in her work that she did say to be her glad right but bade me that i to mine own work to be her dear protector as she did call me and i to lift that wilful one into mine arms a moment and to give her a very loving hug and for that time to have no fear that i harm her because that i was freed of the hardness of the armour about me as you do know and surely she to feel very dear and pretty in mine arms and she kist me the once with a little passion of love and immediately to want to go from me so that i freed her in a moment as was ever my way and she then to pause a small space off from me and lookt at me with a light in her eyes and half to put out her arms that she be taken again into mine but so to cease ere she yield to her heart and turned from me immediately to the task of the washing and she took first my body vest and washt it very quick and clever in the pool and afterward came over by me and spread it upon the hot flat rock anigh to the fire hole and she got then my change body vest from the bundle of her torn garments where she did put it to be washt on opportunity even as now and mayhap to like that it should lie in her bundle with her own garments for so as i do mind the thought came to me very natural but she to say naught to lead me thus yet to be a very honest and dear maid and to have little secret ways of love as i did perceive that i did not be told of and she washt the second body vest and set it to dry by the first and afterward did likewise with all my garments and came then to the washing of her own and lo as she spread it also to the drying there came to mine heart that the maid did have only this one rough and thick garment that did be the armour suit as i have told and surely it did be dreadful that she have the hardness of that strong knitted and fibrous garment to be next to her dear body and i to be in comfort with the softness of my body vest and i was all angered in a moment that she had gone thiswise while that i had been gentled as it might be and i bade naani take the second vest to her own use when it did be dry and she to look upward from where she did turn the garments upon the hot rock and to mean in the first to deny me but indeed she was quick to see that i did be truly in anger and mine anger to come because that i was hurt that this did be and because that i was shamed that she had gone so rough clad the while that i had no thought to the matter and moreover because that she had known her lack and did not tell me of the thing but yet i did have a great tenderness in the backward part of mine anger because that i perceived all the unselfishness and delight of her love that did be about this little matter as you shall see if you have gone alway with me but mine anger yet to be something hard because i did see that i have need to watch the maid that she put not her dear body to pain that i might come unknowing to some little pleasuring or ease as did be now as i have shown and truly it did be sweetly done in love but to be somewise lacking of judgement and so shall you know somewhat of the way that i did be angered and to have understanding with me but if you have not you shall think it to be naught and that the maid did need only that she be kist and to be shaken a little in playfulness and warned to heed that i did be earnest and mayhap you to be somewise right and not to guess far off from the inward deepness of my heart but yet it doth be verity that i was truly angered and fit to shake mine own and in the same moment to be utter tender unto her and surely this doth be all a contradiction and the human heart to be a wayward thing whether it doth be of a man or of a woman and naani as i do think to have loved the chafe of that rough garment for love's sake and to go very humble and loving as i lookt at her but in verity to be never gone from the sweet naughtiness that did be alway in her heart and to plan even in that moment some new and secret service unto me that should be for her quiet joy and to be hid from me until that my wit should come upon it to uncover it and in verity a young man doth want that he whip his maid and kiss her and all in the one moment and indeed he to have delight in both and she obeyed me that time as alway when i did be earnest without more word and surely that naughty one did know how i loved her and the maid washt then her torn garments that did be in the bundle and had gotten soiled by the slime of the dark part of the gorge and she put these to dry and afterward washed mine armour and the scrip and the pouch and the cloak hold and all such matters of our gear and so to be presently done and she was heedful then that she turned the garments upon the hot rock and afterward did attend to my bruisings and when she did rest i lookt to her pretty feet and rubbed them very gentle and constant with the ointment and surely they did be pretty well but i to like that i should tend them and to have joy to feel their littleness within my palms and surely she did know how it did be with me for presently she took her feet inward under the cloak and i maybe to look something woeful for she put one out presently when that i did the least expect and slipt it very cosy into my hand and surely i kist her naughty toes and she then to be very sedate now presently when naani found the garments to be proper dry she gave those to me that were mine and bid me to turn my back and be drest very speedy and lo in a little time when i was nigh done she came over and stood before me and was drest again in the armour suit and to look very slender and dainty and she lookt at me so that i put out my hands that i kiss her but she went from me very proper and brought mine armour and gave me help with it and alway very grave and quiet but yet to have naughtiness underneath as i did believe and when i was full armed she took my hand and set mine arm about her waist and she leaned her head against my breast and put up her lips to be kist as that she did be a child maiden yet when i kist her she did be a woman and to kiss me very dear and loving and to look at me then from under her eye lids and sudden to make a dainty growling and to pretend that she did be a fierce thing that should be like to eat me and i to be utter feared as you shall think and to be scarce able that i kiss mine own pretty fierce one because that i did laugh so hearty and to be so taken with a surprise that the maid did show this new playfulness and in the same moment to be stirred and waked anew that she did be so lovely and graceful in mine arms and to make her naughty growling so pretty that i did be eager that she make it again but she to do this playing only as her mood did stir her and she made then that she would go from me and i to loose her as ever and she bade me that i guard her the while that she washt the outward part of the cloak for the inward did be clean and the cloak proof to water but the outward part to be something needful of washing and surely when this was made clean it dried very quick because that the water went not into it and whilst that it dried i gave mine own an aid upward unto the cave and afterward i passed up the gear and the cloak when it did be dry and so came upward also myself and brought with me a boulder that i balanced very light in the mouth of the cave so that it should fall if that anything toucht it and this plan you do know of for i used it before as i have told and truly we did be utter wearied and the time to be something beyond three and twenty hours since last we had slumber and the maid had the scrip and the pouch set to be for my pillow and the bundle of her torn garment to be for her own and she to have me to my pillow and to tuck the cloak about me and the diskos to my hand and afterward to kiss me very sedate upon the lips and then to come in under the cloak with a quiet and lovely happiness as i did know and to be gone to slumber very content and sweet and i waked eight good hours after with the fizzing of the water in mine ears and lo mine own did be waked and to make ready our breakfast and i came upward upon mine elbow to see whether that the boulder did be unmoved and indeed it was not touched and mine own saw that i was come awake and she ran to me very dear and glad and kist my lips very eager and loving and surely as she kist me i did feel that she had taken again a naughty advantaging of my slumber and had kist me as i did sleep but truly i said no word of my thoughts for i did mind that i should wake sudden one time and so to catch her in this and to call her then mine own and that she did be a rogue and all as you shall know that have loved and i scolded the maid a little in that she had not waked me but i said not that i would attend to the duties that she did heed to for i knew that she had joy of these things in that she did love to do aught that should be done unto me and when i scolded her she to make but a little mouth at me as we do say and to put her tablets to my lips that i kiss them and she to kiss mine and so to our breakfast and when we were done we gat together our gear and went downward from the cave and began again to journey and we went eighteen hours that day and eat and drunk at every sixth hour as ever and in the fourteenth hour i perceived that i did be like to overtravel the maid though i made alway to have a less speed than did be natural unto me and surely then i took her up into mine arms and she to refuse and to be troubled that i should so carry her for she did think that i was like to be wearied by the task and i to take no heed to her pretestings but to laugh gently with her and to carry her even as a babe in mine arms and she to love that she be in mine arms if but she be able to have assuredness that i come not to weariness through her and truly it did be a dear love task and to be set unto the needing of mine especial heart and i carried mine own then for four hours and in the eighteenth hour we were come to that part of the gorge where did be the ledge where i killed the spider ere i slept as you shall mayhap to mind and here i aided the maid to climb and we had the same ledge that night to be our refuge and did sleep very happy and unharmed and alway with our spirits set to warn us if that harm did make to come nigh to us and we went then through three days of eighteen hours' journey each and alway i did carry mine own from the twelfth unto the eighteenth hour of each journeying and this to be very dear unto me and to give me a new rejoicing that i did be strong and easy to carry mine own and she to lie in mine arms very content when that she perceived how that i did be so glad to go thiswise and that i had no weariness by the carrying and thus i did rest her feet and wore not her dear and slender body overmuch with the vigour of my going and was abled to make a very good speed and mine own this time and that to make sayings of impudence unto me and to hide her naughty lips when that i should kiss them and to have quaint nestlings unto me and odd whiles to kiss me very dainty when that i did be going thoughtful of the way and surely never did there be so dear a maid as mine own so that i did go many a mile and to be scarce that i knew that i was gone any way because of the stirrings of my heart and the content of my spirit and oft as we did go there were great scorpions in the path and odd whiles they to have no heed to go from my way but to be so great as my head and very fat and lazy so that surely i kickt a good number from my path even as you shall kick a ball with the foot and three i burst in this way and truly it did be well that i had on me mine armour else had they been like to sting me very quick unto death for they were so great and likewise in this place and that there were snakes but none to come anigh to me and i to choose alway the open goings for i did think there to be many hid snakes and lesser monsters in the dark places between the great boulders and alway when the maid did walk i to go before that i see clear her way and this thing to be but a matter of wiseness as you shall think and odd whiles as i did carry mine own she to talk a little with me of her memory dreams of the olden days and mayhap you to think it strange that we said not overmuch on this wise but the way of our journey to have been so utter bitter as you have seen and we to be more of that far age than we did be of this present age and this present life to seem but a dream of memory and we to be set then with the realness of that life and this telling indeed to be a plain thing to your understanding yet did we have a greater talk to these ends when that we were come free of the gorge but yet oft there to be an odd saying and a sweet memory like to an olden and forgot fragrance of dreams to pass between mine own and me and do you to set your sympathy of understanding with me in this thing and to know how holy these things did be and far off and to hold memory as a mist that doth shine with golden lights that did make an holy pain upon the eyes of the spirit even as a quiet dawn of this day doth set a pleasure of vague pain upon the heart and once as i did carry the maid i saw that she wept a little very husht unto herself and i to say naught for i saw that it did be a natural sorrow for her father and for the dead peoples of the lesser redoubt that did be left for ever unto the desolation of eternity and so because i did be wise to leave her be she to be eased presently and to wipe her eyes quiet and secret and mayhap to think that i did not perceive and then to nestle unto me and so to be the more mine own and about the middle part of the second day we came past the cave where i did sleep on the upward journey and i to tell naani and she to look upward to the cave and to wish that she might come a moment into it only that it did be twenty good feet upward and i to desire that she run no risk of her dear life when that there did be no need and so to go onward and odd whiles to see strange things a lurk among the boulders but none to come anigh to us yet did i keep the diskos very ready in my hand as you shall think and had mine eyes alway to look upon every side and mine ears to be wary and to use my spirit alway to mine aid and surely as we did come lower in the gorge the maid was all a wondered at the warmness that did grow and something disturbed in the first by the new thickness as it did seem of the air and she to waste some of the water because that it did fizz up so quick even as i until that she was come used to this newness and all this to be very plain unto you and in the end of every journey we slept eight good hours in a safe place and so to go onward again and the maid to grow very eager as i did tell her this thing and that of the country that we did come downward unto and she askt me questions time and oft and much i told her and she to think upon it with a growing wonder and desire even as a gladsome child that hath never seen the sea and doth be told that it shall presently be there and this to be but to shadow the way that naani did be for truly she did be a very live and eager maid in all things and we to be still within the gorge and to go constant by the fire holes and the fire pits and to see the flames leap upward in this place and that so that the mighty walls of the gorge would show very plain in an instant and immediately to come the shadows again and afterward the leaping of the flames and so did it be forever and oft the muttering of the fire pits and oft the utter quiet and the shadows and this time and that there did be a snake to go by us and the scuttling of the monster scorpions and mayhap a moving in the shadows of the great boulders that did tell me there went maybe some peculiar monster in that place so that i did be very wary and to have the diskos alway ready and when the fourth day was come i showed the maid in the sixth hour the ledge that did be my first sleeping place when that i was entered into the gorge now presently in the eleventh hour after that we had gone five hours in a gloom there did show afar off a shining and i caught the maid and i pointed and she also to perceive that it did be surely the shining of the light of that great country that i did tell upon and immediately we did begin to run downward and with sore stumblings in this place and that but not to halt us for we did be so mad as two children for the gladsome light and we came down presently in the twelfth hour of that journey into the warm light and wonder of the country of the seas xiii homeward by the shore now we came presently out of that sad and dreary place that did go inward of the great mountains and which i have named the upward gorge and we to halt soon between the feet of the mountains beyond the mouth part of the gorge and naani alway to look every way about her and to breathe very quick and her eyes to be gone bright with wonder and the seeing of new things and the coming of freedom from so great a dread and she turned now and did look upward into the dark of the gorge and to spy upon the great mouth thereof and to be feared then and must run a greater way downward into the lightness of the country of the seas and to come once more to pause and to look backward and with an awe and a relieved soul and so again to the wonder of the spreaded country and the great sea and did near to laugh and cry in the same moment with the amazement and gladness and great astonishment that did be upon her and she to turn constant this way and that and to be never ceased of looking and of deep breathings of the wide air for never in that life had she been in a broad place of light as you shall have perceived and we to feel both that there did be no more need to talk husht as we did alway in the gloom and narrow dark of the gorge and surely she to shout as a child that doth try an echo and her voice to go very pretty into the distance and to be lost afar off in that country and lo in a moment an echo to come out of the dark mountains to our backs so that we lookt round very sudden but whether the echo did be truly an echo or some strangeness or some unnatural call to come downward out of the gloom and horror of the gorge we did be all unsure and indeed must run downward a while more until that we did be all breathed and to halt presently where we did feel to be utter free of the gorge and of the strangeness that did seem to our minds in that moment to lie upward in the darkness of the great mountains and surely we did took about for a flat rock to be for our use and we came presently to a place nice to our purpose that did be yet upward over the land and we climbed up on to the rock and sat thereon to have our food and drink and as we eat and drank we did sit very close and happy but yet to have a wise looking about anigh to us so that we be caught by no danger of the humpt men or by any other danger that might be and alway the maid did question and did stare afar over the country and to have a shining wonder and joy of the sea and to be stirred in all her being so that she was pained with vague and sudden memories that did be as strange dreams and all mixt with pleasure and pain and indeed she sudden to weeping and to need that she be in mine arms until that she know herself once again and so to her dear natural joy and way and oft did mine own speak upon the clear wonder of the air as it did seem to her and to me it did seem likewise that had lived my life also in a dark land as you do know and she to break sudden from her rapture and to set back her speech an eternity with vague words and memories so olden and englamoured that they did be as moonlight that once hath shone and in a moment she to be forward again into that far future time and speech and all her being to be close unto me and oft in a solemn silence of the heart and the greatness of the sea to call unto her with an olden voice and to half waken her and i with her to be thus half wakened yet had i been not thus as i did come mine outward way but truly i did stir to the stirring of the maid and all mine olden thoughts that did be my memory dreams to come afresh upon my spirit and so we two to sit there all shaken with dreamings that did concern happenings of the olden world that did lie upward in that dreadful night which made a mighty and deeply roof over that country and surely i am dumb in that i have no speech to make known to you all the troublings and stirrings of our spirits that we did know in that moment and far off by miles beyond the feet of the mountain where went the shore of the sea upon our left there was a great mist and steam and this to be that mist and steam that i did come through on mine outward way and naani to ask concerning it and i to tell her so much as i knew and how that we must indeed come presently through it upon our journey and she to be in wonder of the volcanoes that did burn in the sea and in this place and that of the wide country and the height and grandness to exalt her and in the same time to give her a strange humbleness of her mind so that presently i did take her into mine arms for i must kiss her because that she did be so utter a sweet maiden and lovely with interest and naturalness and truly she to kiss me in turn and to make her questionings between her kissings and this to be because she did yearn for a greater knowing of the country but also as i do half to think because she did be sweetly impudent unto me and this to be of her joy and presently she to kiss me thrice very passionate and warm upon the mouth and immediately to take my shoulders with her small hands that did seem so pretty upon my broadness and upon the metal of the armour and she to strive thus that she shake me to a speedier answering and she all that while to be full of a dear naughtiness and to need that she be kist very hard and i to answer her but after mine own fashion which did be a word between each kiss that i gave to her and she very quick and naughty to put her hand between our lips and i then to kiss the palm that did be in my way and did be very small and pretty and she when i had no thought to open her fingers very quick and kiss me through between the fingers and immediately to shut the fingers so that i did be stopt from the same and afterward i made her to stand upon the rock and i set free her hair over her shoulders and i took then the boots from her so that her little feet did show bare and pretty and she at the first half to refuse me but afterward to stand very dear and obedient that i should have my way with her and to be a little shy and the more pretty because of her sweet blushings and surely when that i had her to my likings i stept back a little pace and lookt at her and she to look again at me very quaint and naughty and then to turn her about very grave and to make pretend that she did be a dummy figure and surely when she did be come right round and to face me again and had a very sedate look she stretched out her pretty foot all in a moment and put her pink toes sudden upon my lips and i to be so in surprise that i had not wit to do aught ere she had them back swift from me and she then to make one glad spring into mine arms and to want that she be hugged and to be loved very great and i to laugh all tender for i loved her so utter as you do know and i to tell her as you sure likewise to have told your maid that i wanted a pocket sufficient that i might have her therein alway anigh to my heart and this thing i to say to her as a man that doth love shall say it and you to know the way of it so well as i and she to laugh very mischievous and to tell me that she should truly tickle me if that i carried her thatwise aye and to pinch me too and i to have no answer save that i shake her very gentle but indeed she to kiss me very naughty on the mouth in the midst of my shaking and truly what shall a man do with such an one and she then to want to be more sedate and to be set down upon the rock and she to make me to turn around so that she should come at the pouch which did be upon my back and she gat thence the comb that was a fitment and did comb her pretty hair and i to sit and talk with her and to jest with a heart that did be so light as it had not been for a great while for though i did dread the humpt men and the monstrous animals of the country of seas i had not any abiding horror of aught that i had seen in that country for there seemed a naturalness in all things so that i did have no loathing neither any fear of an evil force and presently when that the maid had combed her hair she to bind it upon her head but i to ask that she leave it upon her shoulders because that it did be so pretty and she to smile at me and to be happy to my pleasuring now we did be truly sedate and to set our gear together and i to put the boots upon the maid and afterward we to begin again to journey downward into the country of the seas and we went at a good pace but not to bring us to any great weariness for it was mine intent that we rest for our slumber upon this side of the place where did be the steam of the boilings that was anigh to the shore of the sea as you shall mind and we at this time to be passing along the feet of the mountains unto the place of the steam and to go thiswise for six good hours and still to be a great hour off that part for we went not so fierce as did be the speed of mine outward way which was utter strong as you do mind that have gone with me in all my journey and so when we had walkt six hours we did be gone something beyond the eighteenth hour of that day's journeying and to be very ready to our slumber now presently we found a tall rock very hard to climb that had a flat top so great as may be twice my length everyways and this to be very good to our purpose and when we were come safe to the top we to eat and drink and presently to sleep and to have the cloak under us as did be the will of the maid for the country did be utter warm and nice so that we had no occasion for covering and surely we waked both of us when that we had slept seven good hours and we sat upward and lookt newly each at the other and to be as that we did each see the other anew in that good light and to have a fresh joy each in the look of the other and she to come into mine arms and to kiss and to need that she be kist and truly we both to have our need but yet to be something the more hungry of the other for the having and mine own then to make our breakfast and the water to fizz very strong and surprising and we to eat and drink and to be utter happy each with the other and to talk on this thing and that and the maid to look about as we eat and she to look afar off at the wonders and the newness of the country to her knowledge but i to look near lest there be any danger that might be anigh and in a while mine own to draw my gaze to the mountains that the gorge came through and in verity now that i did look in ease i to see with her how that they did be truly monstrous even as a monstrous wall that did go upward for ever until that they were gone out of the light of that country into the dark night of the deathly upper world that did be lost an eternity and i to mind that i had some vague thoughts thiswise on the outward way but now i to have ease and the maid to speak with and so to perceive odd matters the more and i to tell you this little thing so that you shall perceive the way that restfulness did be upon me by compare with the outward going and truly we had no great speed with our talk and with our eating but in the end did make somewhat to hurry because that we did be conscious that we leaned to slackness and indeed we came down then pretty speedy from the rock where we did sleep and had forward to our way at a good pace and when we had gone a while we to begin to hear the far hissing of the steam and the noise of the upward burstings of waters that did boil and the sound to be very strange but i to have heard it before as you do know so that it to trouble me the less than the maid and i to assure her and she to come nigh to me and thiswise we to enter presently into the steam and we went then for more than three hours and i had the maid to my back that i should be the first and this i did that she have no danger to walk into a boiling pool in the mazingness of the steam which was everywhere and i to be something guided in my path by the shore of the sea which did be unto our left alway only that we could see neither the sea nor otherwise except that we go so close that we near into the water and truly the sea to seem to boil in parts and there to be hot pools in all places so that who should say with ease whether we did go by one of the great hot pools or by the true sea and this our constant puzzle shall be likewise to you and you to perceive how that we did go utter wary and about us from every part there did come the strange burstings and shriekings and whistlings of the boil of the waters breaking upward from the deep world and odd whiles the sounds to be as of great monsters and the earth to shake under us and other whiles there to be a hush and only the steam about us and somewhere in the distance and uncertainness a low piping of some steam cranny very strange and lonesome sounding and when it did be somewheres nigh upon the fourth hour we came out of the thick steam and the pipings and the roarings to be to our rearward and soon the steam to be gone thin as but a mist and the noises to be very far seeming and presently we to be come clear out into the air of that country and the maid now to perceive the trees which did be in great forests unto our right hand while that the shore of the sea did go alway upon our left and she to be utter in wonder of the trees and to need that she pluck branches and smell of them and look at each leaf and so to be all stirred for never in that life did she to have seen such a matter as those great trees did be but yet to be all stirred by vague memories that did seem no more than dreams and you to think but a moment and to perceive how the thing did be with her and you to have been likewise stirred if that you did be so strangely waked in a corner part of the heart though but a little matter to wake you now when the sixth hour did be full come we made a halt in a wise place and had there our tablets and the water and afterward the maid bid me that i take her unto a warm pool that did be near by and to ask that i turn from her but yet to be anigh for her protector as i did be ever and so she to wash and to make herself happy with a sweet cleanness that did be proper to her and afterward when she did be done she to act watch whilst i to mine and to help me in all matters that she was able and truly i to be happy indeed that she did so have delight to attend upon me and to treat me mother wise yet truly with her maid heart not all hid as you have perceived this time and that and surely thus did we go alway in these matters and oft that i have not space to have told and oft that you shall remember if that i do be too full of other happenings to give heed to tell upon and afterward we to our journeying again and to talk upon this thing and that thing and i to be watchful as we talked and to tell the maid that she keep her eyes wary but yet not to be of unease and when we did go thiswise for seven good hours we were come nigh opposed to the bright burning fire hill that did be offward in the sea and had made me a warm light in that time when i did sleep in the tree as you do remember and truly as i shall here mind you we did be past seven hours coming to this place from the part where the steam did be yet had i gone that space upon the outward way at a speed that was greater but truly i might not set so great a pace to the maid save mayhap odd whiles and this thing i beg that you have alway in your mind and so to understand why that we did be oft long upon this part of the journey and that by compare with mine outward going and in verity i had set off our hour for food because that i saw we did come nigh to the place where the tree did be and i to know that the maid should like to eat and drink anigh to that place and to know that i did sleep there and surely i took her to the tree and when that i told her she to beg me that i indulge her and that we go upward to that branch where i did sleep and there to eat our tablets and i to be willing and to enter into her wishing for indeed there was no danger in the climb and i to go alway below her so that i could be surety for her safeness and we came up to the great branch and she to make how we should sit and i to have to show just where i did lie and she to look very close and to see that my weight had surely marked the hardness of the armour upon the bark and she then to be upon that branch alone as she did eat and drink and to look outward at the light from the fire hill and to be very husht and to think and i not to disturb her with speech and when she did be done she gat from the branch and kist the place where i did lie and lo in a moment a thought came into her and she drew her knife and cut out a piece of the bark and put it into her breast to be for a keepsake and so to seem somewise contented and truly i told her about the great beast when we were come down again to the earth and she to cry out and to show me that there did be yet the mark where the belly of the monstrous beast did brush upon the earth as it ran and moreover the broken places of the foot marks and she by this to see how great a beast it did be but yet did it be a little thing beside the slug only that it did be a thing of horn and hardness of skin as you have perceived and truly i do mind how that the observings of the maid did bring very keen to me how that there had past but seventeen days since that i did go onward from this place and this to seem very strange and scarce credible unto me for i had thought it somewise as a great time and truly this to be because it was so marked by stress of the mind and great happenings and you to agree in this thing but yet also we shall truly mind that those times that i have called days did hold oft the hours of two days and mayhap three as you do remember now we went onward then to our journeying and i to make to carry the maid as ever after that she had walked twelve hours though she did walk thirteen hours this time as you have seen and she to say that she go now upon her own feet through the next six hours and so to ease me from the labour that did be needful to carry her but i to know how that she did be like to be all gone of her strength thiswise in but a day or two and we to make the better speed if that i keep to my way and to have her to walk twelve hours of every journey and afterward to come into mine arms for truly she did be bred less hardy than i as you shall think from all that i have told concerning the peoples of the lesser pyramid and moreover she was yet something weakened as i did think by the dreadful month of her lonesomeness and escapings before that i was come to succour her and truly as i did carry her the maid did make remark of her wonderment concerning me in that i did be so hard of my body and set in the determination of my mind and in verity i did be exceeding strong and of great hardness of body and mayhap my will did be somewhat this way also else do i think i had never borne to come unto mine own through so much desolation and i to smile very happy upon her for i did love that i was so strong and very truly in delight that mine own maid did take gladness in this thing and you to mind how you did be also in the love days and so to have nice understanding of my naturalness and human pride and surely the maid did nestle unto me as she did talk even somewise as a child shall come nigh to the mother but yet also as a maid doth love to be nigh unto her man if that she doth truly love and i to lift her more nigh to my lips but she to refuse to kiss me and to be a sweet impertinence that did lie in mine arms yet when i did make to lower her again to the way that had her easy to carry she to slip her pretty face very snug under my chin and to kiss me there after her own fashion and afterward to be willing that she be as usual into mine arms now as i set the maid again comfortable it seemed to me that she was something tender and sudden it came to me that mayhap the armour to be very hard and painful unto her and i to ask this thing of her in a moment and she to see that i would not be put off and so to tell me and truly i was utter angered with myself and somewise also with her in that she did not waken mine unthinkingness to this thing and i set her instant to the earth and made her to bare her shoulders to me and truly they did be much bruised where that she had lain so oft in mine arms against the hardness of mine armour and i to be so angered that i near shook her and she to see how i did be and that she did be nigh to be shaken because that i was grown so angry that she should let herself come to this foolish hurt that yet i did know was very dear unto her secret heart and in truth she put up her lips to me very sudden and with a strange naughtiness that she have her own way with me to tempt me from mine anger that yet she did half to like and in verity i near slapt her then upon her pretty shoulders but that she ceased from her tempting of me and instead she turned her shoulders to me even as a child that i button her garment for her and surely when i had buttoned her garment she came round unto me and closed her hand so that it did be a little fist even as i did love her to do because that it was so small beside my great hand and she slipt her shut hand into mine and surely i let it stay within very quiet and made not to close upon it as i did wont and the maid did move her hand around in mine that she make me to take notice upon her and to grasp her little fist yet i did be very stern for i was truly angered and neither did i put her hand from mine nor made to hold it but only to let it bide yet truly i to be something stirred in the heart part by her pretty ways and in a little while she took her hand from out of mine and did have daring to be cold unto me and mine anger then to be quaintly renewed and to think that she did well need to be whipt and she made a naughty and foolish impudence upon that which i said to her so that presently i did say that she did need such as should make her to heed her manners but yet as you shall conceive i to know inwardly all that time how that even this true naughtiness did not stir me to proper anger but more that it made me masterful and to lack not that i make her to know truly that i did be her master and in the same time to be strangely touched in a very deep and secret place of my heart and truly love doth have strange actings upon the heart and the maid to ask me in a very saucy fashion that did be intentioned to anger me what i did mean that she to need and truly i said that she did go the way to earn that she be flogged like any boy and i to mean actual all that i did say which doth something amaze me now but as i do know i yet to be constant stirred inwardly by her beloved quaintness that did be alway so dainty even when that she did mean her naughtiness to be truly to anger me and lo when i told the maid this thing that she did well go to earn a sharp reproof she turned in a quick instant and came close to me all tender and small and to need to be nigh to me and she slipt both her closed hands into the one of mine and truly they did be little fists and because i could be no more stern with mine own i put mine arm about her and she did nestle to me so that all my being did want to be a shield about her and she to hark very quiet and humble to my counsellings and in the end did be so strangely husht that i lookt down to where her pretty face did be hid against mine armour as she did love to do when that i did be those odd whiles a little stern with her and i held her face away from mine armour and surely she did be smiling very quiet and naughty so that i perceived that she did be good only for that time and did be like to show again this wrongful and impudent spirit yet i not then to be in trouble of the future but to hope only that i do wisely if that she show again this waywardness and truly i to perceive now that i did be very young but anywise as you do know i to act alway from the natural telling of my heart and i shook naani a little for this naughty spirit which did not be gone from her for i perceived that my manhood had but stirred the woman in her to that strange quick humbleness that had seemed to be a quenching of her wayward unwisdom and truly it had not been stilled but only sunken for a little moment in the uprising of her dear nature which had responded unto me and the maid to look at me from under her lids as i did shake her with gentleness and i to know that mine own did be a wondrous maiden full of all life and spirit and to be held wisely and to be loosed wisely all as did be for the best to bring out the uttermost of her goodness which did be in all her being and to be very lovely and to make me feel as that i did be a giant that held a white flower very tender but i to feel also that i did be her master and this mayhap you to understand if that you look into your hearts and by all my telling you to know that i did be very dainty with mine own maid that did be all of daintiness but yet i to be masterful as did be my nature and a very proper way it did be with the maid so that she did be alway reasonable in the main and this to come out of her love which did have pleasure to know that i did be master unto her all in the same while that she did fight to show that i did be otherwise and truly and in part by this same showing you shall perceive that her naughtiness to come likewise from her love and the way that my nature did work upon her now i to shake the maid very gentle as i have said and with much that did be of play but in the same wise there to be also somewhat of tender reproof and surely that naughty maid to spring very light upon her toes and had kist me sudden and dainty upon the mouth before that i did wot and i to put mine arm about her and to give her a little hug and immediately then to matters that did be practical for i was eager to have come across that stony part of the journey that did be before us as you do know before that we look for a place for our slumber and this eagerness of haste to be because of the great bird things which i had seen to go bounding over that waste when that i was upon mine outward way and surely after that i had thought a little moment i bid the maid that she dress in her torn garments so that these should be over the top of the armour suit and thiswise to make a soft thickness upon the top of the armour suit that should act for a cushion between mine armour and her dear body but indeed the maid would nowise to do this thing and i not to make her because that my heart perceived how it did be with her and her reasons to be someways mixt as doth be proper in all humans and the more so when that it doth be a maid that hath reasons as you to know if that you have ever held such dear perverseness in your arms and she as i could know to be strangely in love that her gentle body be bruised by the hardness of mine armour and if this might not be she to be not wishful that she wear her torn clothing upon her neat suit and so to seem careless and to lack to be dainty in mine eyes for indeed she did be alway to wash herself and to make tidiness and she to have a way now that she did set the armour suit upon her that had it to seem different and she to have set a little sprig from the trees upon her breast and in her girdle and so to seem the more of a maid and surely a man doth know and love these things but not alway to have full knowing how that they be done and indeed you to be likewise with me in this thing and we all to think we know but somewise to be just a lack when that it doth come to the proof and in verity the maid to find a way that she be eased of the hardness of the armour and i to have come to the same thing in the same moment but truly i do think she had been able to think upon it a long while if that she had been so desired and truly this was but that i fold the cloak very thick across mine arms and breast and to take her then into the little nest that did be prepared and surely now that the maid might no more have her secret wish that she lie close against mine armour she to be helpful and to have the cloak folded so in a very quick while and so to be into mine arms again and we to be once more upon the journey and she to nestle to me as that she did hunger to be nigh to me and she to talk with me odd whiles and odd whiles to be silent and once i to think that she wept a little and to know that she did be like to think upon her father and her own peoples but she to have her face turned to me so that i could but guess upon this thing and she very soon to be husht again of this sorrow and to lie content in mine arms and once when that i had carried her for three hours she to ask me that i kiss her and truly i did kiss her very gentle and with reverence because that my heart did understand the holiness that did be in her heart in that moment and surely as i kist her she to kiss me very tender and i to know that some olden memory did be like to stir in her and in a moment she to take her lips from mine where she had let them to nestle very light and did whisper mine olden love name and i then to look at her and her eyes to shine as the olden stars that did shine in the olden summers and i to be too shaken even that i kiss her but she to put her arms about my neck and to look steadfast into mine eyes and immediately after that she had lookt awhile and i to have ceased from walking she to put her hands upon each side of my face within the metal of mine head gear where the guards did come down at the sides and she to kiss me very sober upon the lips but yet to mean utter by that kiss and i not to return the kiss for i saw that it did not be her need now in the beginning of the fourth hour as i did go with the maid i to see afar off one of the half bird monsters that i did see before upon this place where there did be naught save great stones and boulders for a great way that did be many miles and truly i to hide very swift with the maid where two great boulders did come together and surely the bird creature to go past at no great way and to go with a great bounding that did be half of flight and half of leaping as that it did be too weighty in the body to make to fly proper and indeed i to have a sudden memory how that there did be a picture in some book that i did read in the mighty pyramid where it did show such a bird thing as this and to make remark in the book that these things had been seen no more in the night land for a score thousand of years or more and to be extinct as we do say but indeed now i do think that they did be come downward to that warm country a great while gone and so to have new life and to breed through a great age and this way to have set a pattern unto the humans and in verity it might be that in some age that did be far after that time the humans to find some way to journey from the pyramid and to build a new refuge in that deep country and mayhap the humans thiswise to have a new space of life after that all the night land did be dead and lost in the bitter frost of eternity but this indeed to be no more than an odd thought for how might any great multitude pass the monsters and i to ask that you take it for nothing of fact but only as of my suppositions and thiswise to come back again to happenings now when the bird thing did be gone a long way off i to go forward again with mine own and to have a new care and to look very swift and frequent everyway and truly it did be as that the creatures did inhabit that part of the country for in an hour after that i to see a good score and i to free the diskos from my hip and to have it ready in mine arms beside the maid and so to journey and many times i to have to hide with mine own and to crouch low among the rocks and the boulders and this way to escape free of all for a great while yet when that the fifth hour did be nigh gone i heard a noise sudden to my back as we did go over a clear space and in verity there did be one of the monsters that came upward over certain rocks that were to my rearward and surely it to have been stayed hid there or resting and to have heard us or to have smelled us but anywise then to have knowledge of us and to come with low and brutish heavy boundings very lumbersome after us and i lookt everyway in a moment but there was nowhere any shelter anigh and the maid to leap sudden from mine arms that i be free with the diskos and i to look swift to her and to see that she have her knife ready in her hand that she might chance to aid me but surely i might not fight in ease of mind if that mine own did be needless in danger and i caught her very quick by the waist and set her upon the ground between my feet and she to make half to refuse but i to have no time for explaining and to be sharp that i have her safe so that i gave her a little shake that did sudden to make her feel the strength in me and she then to be instant quiet in my hands and to let me that i set her upon her face and to cast the thick cloak above her and in a moment to be stood over her and to set down the visor of mine head gear lest that the bird monster strike me in the face and surely the bird thing did be scarce an hundred good paces off and to make two lumbering and monstrous bounds and to come at me yet truly it made sudden a pause because that the diskos did roar and send out fire as i made it to spin but in an instant the great thing to come in at me upon the left side and to strike me very hard with the bill that did be so long as mine arm and had surely gone through my body if that i had been naked and the bill of the monster rang upon mine armour and it smote me twice thiswise so that i staggered very sick and shaken but in a moment as it made to draw off that it should come the more hard upon me i swung the diskos very sure and quick and i smote the bird thing above the place where the great seeming leathern wing did join upon the right side as it should be the shoulder of the bird monster and in verity the monster gave out a mighty squarking and went backward this way and that and beat all about upon the stones and did strike with the great bill at the place where it did be hurt and i heeded that i end it swiftly and i ran in upon it and the creature to strike at me with the great bill very savage but i jumpt speedy to this side and again to that and so in a moment to have chance to come in surely and truly i split the skull of the bird thing so that it died very quick and was gone from pain and the bird creature lay all spread upon the stones and the rock of that place and surely it did be as that it were leathern and made somewise as a bat doth be of this age in that it did have no feathers and truly it lookt mighty where it did be spread and indeed the body to be full so big as the body of a young horse and the bill to be very deadly and sharp and cumbrous as you to have guessed and i to be all and utter thankful that it did be there dead in the stead of mine own body and the thing yet to twitch and stir a little as the life did go from it and surely i was back then very speedy to the maid and she to be kneeled upward to watch me and i took her into mine arms and lookt well about and made then forward again and about the middle part of the sixth hour of crossing that rocky land i saw that we did draw near unto the shallow river that you shall mind i came over after that i had done with the olden flying ship and in all that time since the bird monster to come after us i had seen but two more and they a great way off so that i guessed that i was come beyond that part where they did go very frequent and i to wade over the river and to carry mine own upon one arm the while that i did sound my way with the staff of the diskos and truly i came across very easy save that i did have to go around somewhat where that the river did seem to have a deep place and when that we had crost the river it did be full one and twenty hours since that we slumbered as you shall know if that you but count a little for you do mind that we spent a certain time within the tree as i have told and this not to have been proper counted into the time of our journeying and surely the maid to have been very quiet since that i did show my strength a little to her when that i made her to lie that she be safe from the bill of the bird monster but she not to be anywise in anger upon me but only as i do think that the woman in her did be something fresh waked unto me and she to be very content that she be quiet in mine arms now the place that we were come to was much spread with boulders but yet to have the beginnings again of the forests as you to remember for i to have made some small remark of the land in this part upon mine outward way and we lookt about for a fire hole that i should dry my lower garments and truly we had not past many in a great while but we to be in fortune that we came soon upon a little fire hill that did be no more than so high as a man and to have the rock all hot about so that this did be a good place to our purpose and i kist the maid and set her down out of mine arms and when that i had lookt well about and seen that there did be naught to our sight to give us to fear the maid to help me with mine armour and afterward with my garments and to ease me all ways that she could think of with helpfulness and she set the garments of my lower parts to dry and whilst that they did be drying she to make ready the water and the tablets and to have me to sit beside her in my body vest and gear and we to eat and drink very comfortable in the warm hollow that was something anigh to the small fire hill now truly i did be very hungry that time and indeed to be alway so for the tablets did be very unfilling to the belly as you do well know from my tellings and when that i did be finished i saw that the maid lookt at me somewise oddways and sudden she to come into laughter and askt me whether that i did be very empty and in the same moment there to be a wondrous dear look within her eyes so that i perceived that there went a mother note under her impudence and she to yearn as i could know that she have some way to feed me but truly there did be no way for we thought not to make to slay aught for our purpose and we did be feared that we eat any root or plant lest that we be ill and this to seem strange to my spirit of this our age but to be natural unto that so that i do think i did be so long bred from the primal obtaining of food that i did be all lost to that which should seem natural unto the peoples of this early age of the world though we truly to think that the world doth even now be old and this to have seemed a true thing unto every age that ever did live now beside that we did lack somewise to think serious that we slay something to eat in that the tablets did actually suffice to our strength i to believe that there did be some other reason that i do forget and mayhap never to have thought plain upon but which to be set within me as an instinct as we do say and this to mean if that i try to set it in other words that the tablets did keep the body and the spirit in such condition that the forces of evil did have the less power to act upon us yet have i no remembering that i was taught in the preparation that i eat naught save the tablets and this mayhap never to have been set upon me but to have been as a thing that doth never need to have been told even as you shall not tell a grown man in this age that he shall refrain from dung and eat only wholesome matter and truly i to hope that i have made this thing somewise clear unto you for indeed it doth be something hard to set out for every age hath the subtleties peculiar to that age and these to be hard to the understanding of other ages but yet to seem plain and utter natural even without thought unto the peoples of the age and surely all this to be plain to you and to be over plain for in verity i tell to you and over tell until that i should be weary and mayhap you to be the more so and indeed i not to blame you but only to hope that your understanding which doth mean also in general your hearts doth be with me all along my way and indeed this my tale to be not easy told and in verity i to be back now unto the maid a laugh upon me and in the same moment deeply loving and a lack that she could not feed me and i to laugh with her and to have understanding with her as you to know and indeed i to have an heart that doth be made someways natural unto understanding so that even though i be dead when you read this my tale you to feel that we be friends and to know that could i meet with you in pitiful trouble i to have understanding and love to you if that you be not utter brutish and even so i to be sorrowful that you should be brutish and to have understanding in that i to know that by developement you to become wise unto sweetness and charity and in love with all dear things and kind pity of the rest and thiswise you to be in human sympathy with me because that you do feel that i be honest with you and somewise even now to your elbow as you read and this to be writ now and you mayhap not to be born a great while yet but in the end to read and to have understanding with me and to know how i did love mine own and so we to go forward again the closer in that we do be the more knit in dear human sympathy and surely the maid kist me very nice on the lips and did promise again how that she should make me a great meal when that we did come to our mighty home and indeed as she to say she to join with me and we both to be naughty gluttons for that once and surely i laughed gently at the maid because that she should be so dainty a glutton but for my part i to feel that i could eat an horse as we do say in this age and by that we had eat and drunk and talked awhile and lookt oft about so that we know that no brutish thing came near to our hurt the maid to tell me that my garments did be dry and she then to give me aid that i dress very quick and afterward she to help me with mine armour the which she did wipe after that we had eat and drunk and she to have had joy that she do this thing and all things for me and to have used a part of her torn garments to this end and so truly i to be clothed and armed very speedy and to feel eased and the more sure in my mind for in verity i was alway in unease when that i did not be ready that i be able to meet any horrid brute that should be like to come upon us now when that i did be into mine armour again the maid to set the scrip and the pouch upon me and all the while i scarce to be loosed of the diskos as ever and we then to our way which did be that we find a place proper to our slumber and when that we did be gone all ways and no cave proper to our sight we found a great tree that did be set off alone and had a plenty of branches but none that did be near to the bottom part and surely i gave the maid a lift and held her up so far as mine arms did go so that she might stand upon the palms of my hands and be steady against the trunk of the tree and she thiswise to have a hold upon a branch and so to go upward and truly when that she was safe i loosed one of the straps from the pouch and the scrip and i cast this up to the maid and she set it strong about the branch and when i had caught the downward end i went upward very easy and afterward took loose the strap and this way we did be something safe as you shall see and we climbed upward then and so came to a part of the tree where the branches did be very thick together and we made here a place for our slumber and the maid set the cloak over the branches that did be so close and afterward we lay down but first i set the strap about her waist and thence to a branch and she to refuse sleep until that i be likewise so that we did be both very safe from any fall and she kist me and we then to our slumber and very weary for it did be two and twenty hours by this since that we had sleep now we had eight hours in which we slept utter and we both to awake as it did seem in the same moment but truly i to think that mine own did be wakeful before that time for indeed as she put her arms very dainty about my neck that she kiss me i did have a quick and sudden knowledge that i had been kist oft in my sleep and this to have been but a little while gone and surely it did seem to me that mine own did have a sweet and contented mischief inward of her eyes but yet she to be very sedate outward and to kiss me loving and dear and then we to our breakfast upon the cloak and afterward i climbed to the topmost branches of the tree and lookt well over the country all about but there was no brutish thing to my sight in any place neither near nor far and i came down then to the maid and told her how that there was quietness of life all about and we had our gear together and went downward to the earth and i to help mine own and this way she to be safe now as we went forward upon our journeying i perceived that the maid had a wayward air and truly i thought that she did have her heart all set toward naughtiness and mischief and in the same moment that i was in this belief i did know in mine understanding that this did spring from the workings of my nature upon the nature of mine own maiden and naani to walk in the first beside me and to have no word for me because that she did be so filled with the stirrings of her naughtiness that did be in the same moment very sweet unto me and yet to waken all that did be masterful within me and she to be that she did know and to delight in her secret heart that she waken that which did be masterful in me but yet in the same moment to be strong determined that she be not mastered by me and surely this to seem contrarywise in the words but to be clear to the heart if indeed you have ever been loved by a dear maid of an high spirit and above all this the maid did be filled with a love for me that did beat and dance in all her being and this in truth to overweigh all but yet from this same thing her dainty naughtiness to be born because as i did say my manhood to stir all her nature up wise in sweet trouble that did be half of rebellion and half that she did ache that she be close unto me in mine arms and in verity you to be with me in all these things if that you have had the love days beside a dear and dainty maid of an high and pure and natural spirit so that if you be old these days even but the light merriment of a passing maiden to bring a pain of wonderings and golden memories upon your heart and presently i saw that mine own put a little space between us as the naughtiness did work in her as my heart to know and she to be offward from me a little and she still to have no speech with me but in a little to begin that she sing in a low voice and to have her pretty body very upright and lithesome and to go forward with a wondrous dainty swing so that my heart told me that she did all be stirred with small thrillings of defiance unto me and with thrillings of love and she to have the triumph of her maidenhood and of her womanhood as it were both to contend in her and to thrill upon her tongue and to show out the lilting and pretty warfare of her spirit that did go dancing and dearly naughty in her breast and surely i went very lifted in my heart and astir for it did be wondrous to me that this lovely maid did be so utter mine and to see but the way that she set her feet to the earth and the way that she did lift them sure and dainty and the way that her body did be poised and the way of her head and the way of her naughtiness and the sweetness and the love that did be wrapt in with all did make me want that i have her in mine arms but yet i not to do this because that in the same time that she did so stir me to love and admirings she to set somewhat else in me at variance so that i did half to feel stern with her for i perceived that she had that naughtiness then within her that she did be like to have a real intent of impertinence unto me so that she should be naughtily outrageous and to have no heed to my advisings neither unto my desires unless that i set my hand upon her to make her to obey and truly you that have had dear maids shall follow mine explainings but unto others i know not whether they shall understand until they too have been possessed of one that shall set all their heart adrift even as this one that did be mine own and sudden i to know that naani did change from her low singing unto an olden air that had surely not been heard in all that eternity and in verity for a little while i not to know why that it did so shake all my heart nor what it did be nor whether that i had truly heard it before or only to think so and surely it did be as that the silence of the olden moonlit world did steal all about me and sudden i to know that the maid did sing an olden love song of the olden world and to go halting a little as she sang because that the words did steal something odd wise through the far veils of her memory even as a song doth come backward out of dreams and i to feel all my blood to seem to tremble in my veins and my throat to be troubled as with vague sobs that did be the ghosts of forgotten tears and the dim sorrow that had come so swift and strange upon me to be likewise steeped in golden mists of the love that i once did love and the glamour to be come all fresh upon me and i to know in that moment how much we do forget even when that we do believe that we have all memory and all sorrow within our hearts and i lookt unto the maid something dimly because of the way that i did be and i perceived in a moment that mine own did weep as she walked but the less with pain than with the strange anguish of memory that doth have in it tenderness and sorrow and love and all that hath been and all that did never be and all to make a vale unto the spirit where doth be both a dim greyness and a warm and everlasting light and an utter speechlessness and the low and far music of forgotten songs that do come downward over the shadowy mountains that do be builded of years and forgetfulness and yet made to be seen with the light of that our memory which doth cast so many husht shadows and surely as i did say the maid did weep as she went but not to be cast down but rather that she held her head upwise as that she did walk in a glory and the song to come oft broke and oddly and to set her voice to little human quiverings as her memory did shake her sweet spirit unto tears afresh and she to walk with her pretty head upheld and as that she did go in a triumph and the tears to come down strangely upon her face and all her soul to be there pure and wondrous and in the same time both troubled and glad and this thing to be very dear and amazing and she to be as that she not to know then that she sang but as that she did be lost in her thoughts as we do say and this to have come sudden upon her out of all her upliftedness of spirit that had been like to make her very open unto all subtile and subtle powers of thought and inward stirrings as you shall think and again the song to come full remembered and fresh as that this eternity did be but the yesterday of that moment and mine own to be all in a sweet madness with those half dreamed memories and the wonder and pain of all that no man hath ever said and that shall be never said and of the utter lost years and all that hath been lost and all forgotten greatness and splendour and the dreadfulness of parting and the loveliness of beautiful things that do be hid in the abyss of the years and it did be sudden to my quickened fancy that there did be low echoes all about us of the voices of dear beautiful ones that have died for so did memory set a strange and lovely mystery about my spirit in that moment that i did be all shaken so much as mine own and i to be as that i drew my breath anigh to tears and did be there with naani amid the quiet spareness of the trees and the rock of that part of the land but yet did be to see half dimly that i stood within a light even as the light that doth be the wonder of olden sunsets and i to be in the same time both that man and this man that now doth write and to have beside my spirit but one maid that i did lack to know whether i say to her naani or mirdath for though the two that have been mine own did be different seeming to the eye there to be but the spirit of one maid beside me in that moment and surely i did be there all shaken unto the seeing of visions as it did seem so that the land about me to have grown half as that it did lack that it be real unto my sight because that i lookt inward unto lands that did be of memory and lo in a moment this to go and i to be in that country of the seas and to look newly unto naani and she to go as i have told and there to be the lonesome trees and the rocks in all parts for a great way about and sudden as i lookt at mine own she to come round unto me and she held out her arms and did gaze at me with such a love as that she were transfigured and to need strangely that she be in mine arms and surely i to an holy need that i have her unto me because that after all there did be no wonder so great as that wonder that when all did be said i did have mine own after that all eternity had nigh past and in verity we ran each to the other and did be silent because that there was no speech of words by which we could say aught of all that did be in our hearts and truly you to be with me in understanding for you too mayhap to have suffered thiswise of dumbness even if that it hath not been so great but yet to make you to know and presently we grew quiet in the spirit and mine own to come back again to her joyousness and to go beside by me as we made forward and presently naani to begin that she look at me with dear impudences again that did be very sweet unto me but yet to be like to lead unto defyings and truly by these things shall you know the spirit of mine own maid and there to be none to me that ever did be like her but indeed you to think thatwise of the maid that you did love and all the world to be thinking each these thoughts of one dear maiden that doth be the one maid in all the round world and this to be the lovely niceness of the human heart and i not to have any grumble thereat but yet surely you shall say that this maid that did be mine own did be very dear and lovely and in verity i to show my human heart in this thing for you likewise to want that i think your maid to have been just so dear and the more so and indeed we ever to be going these ways and to have good comradeship of understanding because that we have all loved and suffered joy and had utter belief in a dear one and surely a defyingness to come presently into the way that the maid did go and she to walk a little offward from me and truly i lookt at her both with love and yet with somewhat that did be to reprove her gently and all in the same moment that she to make my heart stirred with her sweet naughtiness and she to look sudden at me and to be that she half to intend to run to kiss me but also that she be minded in the same moment that she set herself up impertinently against me and in verity she made me to harden my nature a little as manhood doth make a man to do and this because of the rebellion that i knew to be in her and she likewise to know but she hid her eyes when that i shook my head half with play and half with earnest and was then impudent unto me and gone from that in a moment to her pretty singing and her naughty walking apart but she no more to sing an olden love song now in a while we past a basin of rock in a place among the trees and there was a warm spring bubbling in the rock and the basin to be full of water very warm and with some smelling of chemistry and the maid told me that she would wash and i to think it a good place for that end and when i had tasted the water i found that it did seem smooth and proper for our intent as that there did be a verity of an alkali in it and truly we washed and after that i was done the maid bid me that i turn my back and i to do this and she to mock me very naughty whilst that i could not see her and to seem very quiet for indeed i heard no splashings of water though i stood off from her a long while and she alway to say naughty things unto me as that she did mind truly to have me angered for indeed she did have a plain intent that she mock at me and to ease not her wit and surely after that i had stood a great while i askt the maid when that she did be like to be done but she to say that she was nowise ended of her toilets and i knew very sudden that she made foolishness upon me also in this matter and i turned upon her and lo she did be sitting upon a little rock very sedate even as when she had bid me turn from her and to have made no more forward but only to have been there at ease that she keep me turned away to please her naughty mood and all the while have a double liberty to have impudence upon me and in verity i did be a little angered but scarce that i did know it for i did love her very great and was stirred inwardly with her dearness and that she did look just that wise that i knew not whether i to need to kiss her or to shake her and truly how should i know for my heart did ache that i have her to mine arms but my brain to say that she did go over far in the joke and truly you to see that i did not be unreasonable neither to be lacking of grace for indeed i do think that i was swayed all ways because that i saw all the dear way that her pretty nature did work and to conceive of her mood and to understand and be stirred but yet to shape a little in my manhood unto hardening and in my judgement unto sternness yet truly i scolded mine own with no more than a little jesting and did be nice and gentle with her because she did be so dear and i to know just wise her mood and the cause and working of it and i told her that i did love her and that she hasten now and let us again to the journey but indeed she only to make a face at me so that i did be near like to shake her unto sedateness and she then to be both merry and a rogue as we do say and to stop her ears and again to sing very gleeful and all so that she might not hear aught that i said and surely she lookt a very dainty rebellious one and i went then straightway to her and took her hands from her ears and i kist her pretty ears very gentle that i not to deafen her and i kist her lips as she did sing and afterward shook her that she be not such a sweet torment but this to have no success that way for she only to put out her toes to be kist for her foot gear was off from her feet and indeed i laughed even as i made to frown and truly i kist her pretty toes and tried then to coax her to go forward something speedy with her hair and to be ready to the journey but she only to sing and to refuse to be sedate and in verity in the end i caught her up in mine arms and had her bundle in my hand and so went off with her very sudden with her hair all loose upon me in a lovely and soft shining and her feet bare as they did be and this action i made because that i was grown truly a little stern with mine own for indeed she did half to need that she be whipt unto properness as you shall think that have seen how she did be thiswise only because that her nature did be stirred strangely and her womanhood and her maidenhood to be all unto war and in part to make a rebellion against me that she did know glad to be her true master but yet she to be thus even though she did be so glad and this to act so that she did be in the same moment both sweet and wise and yet to show a dainty foolishness and a true naughtiness that did make me to feel somewhat of a real anger but yet did have me to know that all my being did be stirred by her so that i did think with one thought that she did be very foolish and with another that she did be lovely wayward now when that i took the maid up so quick and made off with her she to give a little gasp and to submit to me with a quick humbleness but immediately she to regain her courage and to be outraged of me but indeed i took no heed only that i was like to shake her and did know also that her hair did be wondrous pretty upon mine armour and she soon to lie very quiet and easy in mine arms and to be demure and i to have a half knowledge of somewhat amiss but yet to have no sureness neither to think much upon this vague feeling and when that i had gone a good mile she to put up her lips to be kist and i to kiss her very loving for she was so dear and she then to say very ordinary like that i should do wisely now if that i went back for her foot gear which truly i had lacked thought to notice when that i did pick up the maid and i saw that she had known this thing all that while and had made that mile of carrying all a waste and a foolishness because of the naughty rebellion which did be in her and lo i set her instant to the ground and she gave out a little cry as she saw that i did be gone somewise hard and stern with her and indeed i pulled a small branch from a tree that did be near to be for a switch as you shall whip a boy with and i held her with my left hand and in verity i laid the switch thrice very sharp across her pretty shoulders that she know all that she did need to know and she seeming to be ceased in a moment from her perverseness and did nestle very quick unto me that had whipt her and did need that she be wondrous nigh unto me and truly how shall even a young man flog such an one and the maid to be very husht against mine armour and to resist that i look into her face that did be prest so anigh me but presently i used a little and gentle force and so to look into her face something sudden and truly that one did be smiling very naughty and dainty to herself so that i perceived that i had not truly whipt her enough but yet i could harden my heart no more at that time for in verity there doth be a strange half pain in the bosom if that you have to flog a maid that doth be utter thine and this to the despite that there hath been as then no properness of anger to have for an after self reproach and surely i to have done this thing only of a stern intent and steadfastness that i steady mine own maid unto wisdom but yet to have been helpt by a little anger because of the thing that she had done yet alway my love did be so strong that mine anger never to have aught of bitterness as you shall have seen and to understand and we went back then for the foot gear of the maid and she to be very husht in mine arms but yet as i perceived not to be quiet of an humble little heart but only of the chance that her nature did be stirred that way for the while and truly when we were gone back the foot gear did be there to the side of the pool and the maid gat shod very speedy and would have no aid and afterward did up her hair very tight upon her head to have it utter from my sight and this to be for a perverseness for she knew that i did love to see it pretty upon her shoulders or if that she must do it that she do it up very loose and nice and truly you to know how i mean only that i have no skill of such matters but yet a good taste to admirings if that the thing be aright and i to say nothing as i looked at her and she presently to make a quick glance unto me to see why i did say naught and i shook my head smiling at her waywardness but she to look away from me and to seem to be set to fresh naughtiness now we went forward then upon our journey and alway the maid to walk onward from me but yet to have no other impudence neither to sing and i to go kindly with her but yet to think that she did lack somewhat to know that i did be truly her master and i to wonder a little whether she did know proper that my gentleness with her did be not of weakness but born of understanding and love and the more proof that i did be fit to possess and to guide her and truly this was the thought of a young man yet lacking not of reason in the bottom part though mayhap to be something clumsy seeming unto the mind of a maid and to be very human to my years and you to have been likewise if that you have tried all ways with a dear one and she to be yet over wilful so that you to wonder whether she did truly know how you did understand and surely a maid doth know much that doth be in the heart of a man if that she be true woman in her own secret heart and oft she doth know more of her man than her man doth wot of himself and to go her own diverse ways that she search out and bring forth and waken all that is the inward being of the man that she doth love yet when that she have stirred you in the deeps that you scarce to know she to be all fearful and in the same moment to have no fear and to be in rebellion and in the same moment to be most strange humble and all to be born of love and nature in action upon nature and more than this how shall i have learning of the heart to tell you for in verity there doth be much in these few lines if that you know to read and surely you to know or to learn but if neither then have you gone short of joy and the true inwardness of life now this way i did be as i have told and the maid to be quietly naughty in perverseness as also i have set out yet to have a strict mind to her duties and to go now wondrous sedate upon the journey yet alway apart and likewise when that the sixth hour did come and we to our halt as ever she to be very speedy and nice that the water and the tablets be ready for me but yet to have no word neither to eat by me but again a little apart and not to share the water but to make a brewing to herself when that i had done and likewise the maid held not up her tablets to be kist as alway but eat them quiet and meditative and with little nibblings as that she did ponder upon other matters or mayhap to be not hungry and these things i saw as we eat and drank in a silence and i to look at the maid somewise sad in the heart and something stirred and i to say to myself wisely yet as a young man that she did not yet be taught sufficient that i was her master and this you to perceive and she never to seem to look at me but to be quiet and demure and to have her eyelids something down upon her eyes now presently as i thought upon the matter i saw that i do well that i take no heed of mine own but to let her to come to a natural end of this naughtiness that did be in the same time both pretty and a little foolish so that in half i condemned it and in half i was stirred and alway i loved the maid very dear and had a good understanding and there to be also an interest in my heart at this new side that she did be showing and also she to stir me odd whiles unto masterfulness and so you to know pretty well how it did be with me in the matter now surely i found this plan that i attend not to the maid to have something of success for i knew presently that she did look upward at me slyly from under her pretty eyelashes and after to be demure in a moment and this to go forward for a while yet i to show no heed and in a while i saw that she gave attention to her garments in the way of nattiness and afterward she took down her hair and made it up then very loose and pretty upon her head so that she did be very lovely and to tempt mine eyes that they look alway at her but indeed i did make as that i had no heed that the maid did shape her hair different upon her head and she very soon then to speak and to have the lesser gear together and to make that she attract me but truly i was very nice with her yet to keep her now a little off from me in the spirit and so to teach her that wise that she was somewhat of a dear naughty maid but also as i do think i was this way because that in part i would tease her in great love of her prettiness and her makings up to me and so maybe even that i make her to be the more defying of me and this to be as that i also lacked somewhat of reason for i did strangely that i think that she need to be whipt and in the same time that i go to make her the more deserving of the same yet this to be the truth as i know it and surely to be the natural waywardness of love but yet there did be also in the backward part of my wisdom an intent that i be wise and careful with mine own and i surely to have no full realisings that i did be like to set her further unto perverseness than yet she did be now after that i had shown well that i lacked to heed the maid i found that i did be looking oft at her and she to be so dear and pretty and to be all husht that truly i could not bear that i be longer silent to her advancements and i ceased then from pretending and would have had her into mine arms but she to be now in sweet dignity and to keep me off with very sober graces and because of this i to feel someway that i did be someway in blame and surely now that i consider it i can see that i was something acted upon even as had been the maid and so we two to be and a most human pair as you to say and somewhat both a lack but indeed we did be very wholesome and in utter love each of the other and mayhap both then to perceive something of the sweet foolishness within us that did be as yeast a work in us for i thought that naani did smile a little to herself but surely this clear seeing to be but for an odd time and afterward we each again to earnestness in our way with the other but alway even when we did make to show indifference we to be something troubled inwardly with sweet flashings of our bewildered natures now though i have shown you that i to know that i did be not utter free of this most strange and natural foolishness yet you to perceive that i tell this only that i have utter truth of all things that did happen for in verity because that i was something subtly touched this way at whiles yet was this no full excusing of the maid though in the same moment you to perceive that there did be only the half of me to think that she did need to be excused for in truth mine understanding went alway in the main with the workings of her nature and had a natural sympathy with her dear whimsies but also as you to know i to be stirred constant in my manhood by her naughty defyings and to be troubled in my natural sense when that her whimsies made her to act that she be likely to come unto aught of harm and surely now you to see all the way of my heart and to have understanding in things that do follow and alway you shall mind that i did love her utter and to crave alway that i be a shield unto her though truly there doth be mayhap somewhat in me that doth act to make me a little stern seeming in my love but yet not oft so as you do know that have gone with me in all my tellings now we went then upon our journey and the maid to be somewhat before me and offward to the side upon my right and to have no speech with me but to make a good pace and to be very dear and graceful as she went and now we did pass this thing of strangeness and now that and these i did point out to her and made some telling concerning the same having the memory of mine outward way and how that i did see these things then when that i was all in suffering of so lonesome a doubt and she to hark alway very intent and to move her head nice and intelligent to show that she heard me and once i saw that she lookt sudden at me with a dear light in her eyes but this to be done in a moment and she to be again silent seeming and in her new perversity of dignity and surely she did seem so utter sweet in this new way of naughtiness but yet i did think odd whiles that i should like to shake her unto dear humbleness and her usual way and in the twelfth hour we made halt again and had our food and our drink and the maid to serve me very clever and quiet as that i did be her lord and she an husht slave and i saw that she made a constant and naughty mock upon me and truly as i did half think she to need that she be in care that i not treat her sternly as shall a slave master and to give her that which she did ask for so mute and impudent but alway she did stir me mightily to have her to mine arms and to love her very dear and presently we did be again to our way and to be yet silent so that i scarce knew whether to have patience with mine own or whether that i take her and speak seriously with her to cease this play which did begin a little to dispirit me somewhat strangely and in the end i went over to her as we did walk and i put mine arm about her and she to yield to me without word and to hark very quiet to my speech of reasoning and gentle sayings and to hide whether she did be stirred inwardly or not though indeed my spirit to know that her spirit did never be afar off from mine in all deep matters but only this thing to be to the top and to set somewhat between us that did be both a sweetness and a trouble and alway as i talked with the maid i saw that she did make naughtily to act as that i did be a slave master and she but a chattel to me for she to be husht before me and neither to yield her slender body willing to mine arm nor to resist me but only to be still as that she had no saying in this matter and as that i was like to beat her at my pleasure or to withhold my hand all as might chance to be my desire and this i perceived was the shaping of her actions so that all her dumbness and her quiet obedience did be but a way to say this thing to me and all to have come from her love of me and that she did be shaken in her nature by my manhood and so to be but a new form of her naughtiness that did have this change when that i whipt her and all this you to perceive that have gone with me and i saw that she would not cease from this perverseness but made a dumb and naughty and hidden mock upon me very dainty and constant and scarce to be truly perceived save by the inward sense and truly i grew something angered afresh and to feel that she did need that she be shaken so stern that she come unto the reality that i did be her man and natural master yet alway in love and surely i loosed her then and went off a pace to her side and we again to go forward thiswise yet she soon to have a greater distance between us which she made very quiet and natural but indeed i saw what she did now about the fourteenth hour of that journeying i saw before us in the far distance the rock upon which did be the olden flying ship that you shall remember and presently as we came more nigh i lookt oft to mine own and i saw that she did be staring that way and to be in wonder but yet to say naught to me and soon as we came very close i did want that i tell her about the ship and of mine adventuring there and of the wonder of that olden ship set there through eternity but in the first i hesitated as you shall think because of her way but truly my heart knew that her heart did be proper unto me and moreover i should be small in my nature if that i let any pettiness put a silence upon me though in verity if that the maid had not been inwardly loving to me i had been that i had told her no word and this to be very natural whether it be of smallness or not and when that we were come beside the great uprising rock i made halt and the maid to halt with me and i showed her how that the thing upon the rock did be an olden flying ship from the mighty pyramid and in the first she askt no questions but did be quiet and but to show with little noddings that she did be greatly interest and i to show to her how that this olden ship did be there mayhap an hundred thousand years and to have been there as it did seem to us that were of that age since the beginnings of the world though in verity our two spirits did know that the beginnings of that age did be truly the ending of this as you also to know and much i told mine own and afterward concerning the two humpt men that did come after me and she alway to be silent until that i spoke of the fight but then to come round upon me very swift and with a dear light in her eyes and had askt before she did wot whether they did hurt me and surely this to have been the first thing of her olden sweet naturalness that she did say for a great while and i to be so in delight that i had her into mine arms and kist her very loving all in a moment and she to submit with a nice gladness and to nestle unto me and all unwitting that she did be gone from her waywardness yet in verity she did be a naughty maid for she minded in an instant that she did forget her pose unto me and lo her lips did be no more to search unto mine but to be as that they did be kist only of my will and she to have no more live nestling unto me but only to be quiet in mine arms and i lookt into her face and her lids to be down somewhat over her pretty eyes and she did look very husht and demure so that truly i knew not whether to shake her or again to kiss her but in the end i loost her and made then that we go forward yet indeed she did rather stay awhile to hark further concerning the olden ship and of mine adventurings but she did then to mind that she obey as a slave shall obey and truly i did punish her in that i told her no more but went forward at a good pace and had some natural wonder how that i deal with such a maid if that i spare to shake her and surely i thought then again that i leave her be and so to have her presently again to her old and natural way now in a while i lifted the maid into mine arms that i carry her as ever through the last part of each journey and so to have her never over tired for the morrow and she for a moment to resist but instantly to give unto me and to lie quiet in mine arms as that she had no saying in aught that did be done but must alway obey and indeed you to see how dearly perverse she did be and i went on then through four hours from that time and lookt oft upon every side and walkt quietly for truly we were come now into a part of the country where i did feel that there might be near some of the humpt men but i saw nowhere anything to put me in dread and alway as we journeyed there did seem a great stillness in all the country near about and afar off the low mutter of the great fire hills in this place and that and a drowse as of life and warmth about us and everywhere the air very rich and plentiful and presently when that we did be come down from that high place where did be set the rock and the olden ship we came in among the trees that came very nigh to the shore for a great way and oft as we did go there were clumpings of small fire hills that did cast fire and noise and oft the roaring of monstrous springs a boil and then again the smell of the woods about us and oft still in odd places the low near sound of a little fire hill that did burn lonesome in some clear space of the woods in this place and that and afterward we to be gone onward again into the dull low mutter that did be in all the air of that country and that did but make a seeming of silence because that it did be so far and constant now about the eighteenth hour i to note that the noise of the great fire hills grew more loud and i saw presently over the trees afar upward in the great night and gloom that did lie above those two mighty fire hills that i did feel to make the earth tremble in that part upon mine outward way and surely i have told something of this before and you to remember if that you but think a little moment now it may appear strange that i speak thiswise of seeing the two hills of fire as that i had perceived them sudden but indeed i had been long abled to see them both yet to have had no attention to them because that they did be a great way off and because they did be but two hills of fire in a country that did be plentiful with such and truly i not to have said aught about them only that our path did take us now by their feet and i to see them as it were newly and to have nice ease of heart to perceive how that they did be a wonder unto the spirit and the brain for all time for it did be as that the earth had a constant shaking within miles of them and that a monstrous force of nature did be in that place but yet there to be no desolation around as you should think but in all parts a wondrous growing of trees and great plants in abundance and the trees to grow upward upon the shoulders of the mountain and there to be no falling of hot rocks and ash as you to think but all very sweet and wholesome as that the mighty valley made a chimney to the mountain and mayhap to others so that their waste if that they had such did go free but indeed you shall take no heed of this explaining save as an odd thinking that hath come to me and to be without foundation and there to be no surety of the reason to this only that there did be no falling of ash in that part as i do know yet in other parts of that country the fire hills did make new mountains of the matter that did come from them but this not to be alway so and there to seem to my knowledge no cause to order why this did not be constant save that my guessings to be right or naught to be blown from some but indeed i to be sure only of that which did be plain to mine eyes and mayhap there to be no mystery in the thing but a score of natural explainings if that i did know or had patience to think long enough upon such now when that the eighteenth hour did be proper come we to be anigh to the great hills and there to seem nowise any danger of falling fire so that i sought about for a place for our slumber and i found a cave in the side of a big rock and the cave was dry and comfortable and had the mouth about a score feet above the earth and when that i had climbed and lookt well into the cave i gave the maid an help and had her safe into that place and she then to prepare the tablets and the water the while that i brought up a boulder from below to set very light balanced in the mouth of the cave and this i meant for a signal to fall if that any creature should climb upward into the cave while that we did sleep and surely you to know this plan for i did it before as you to have learned and the maid sat near to me and eat her tablets very quiet and with a demure naughtiness but yet to be also in wonder and to gaze outward at the great fire hills and to be in awe as i did know and i put my half anger and my play from me and told her of mine outward journeying and how i did go by these same mighty fire hills that did seem as mighty torches to light me in my search and to have held a new strangeness and wonder over my path and she still to be silent but yet to look at me twice or thrice with a very dear and loving way though she did hide her eyes in a moment when that she saw that i perceived her and soon the maid spread the cloak for our sleep and while that she did this i lookt well about for any creature that might be anigh and i had an especial thought unto the humpt men but indeed there was naught living unto my sight and nowhere did i see anything to put me in fear for our lives and truly i had a great viewing from that place for we did be in an upward rock that stood in a high part and the cave to be twenty good feet aloft as i have told so that all made to set us in a lofty place and the cave to look toward the two mountains that did rise upward no more than twelve good miles off from us as i do think and the country between to be somewise as a mighty park for it was spread much about the feet of the great fire hills and did be bare in this place and that as that rock did make the earth naked there or the falling of some later fire to have wrought thus and between the bare parts there went strange and romantic woods seen mistily and in parts the gleaming of waters as that hot lakes did be half shown among the broken forests and presently the land did go upward with a monstrous sweep and was then in great terraces in the height and trees to grow very plentiful upon the mountains in sundry parts and so those two mighty hills to go upward to meet the everlasting night and presently to show strange uplands that did be seen very wondrous and queer in the light that did glow from the vast glowing of the fire that did be a crown upon the hills that did seem in verity to be that they burned halfway between that known world and the lost olden world that was mayhap two hundred great miles above in the everlasting night and eternity of darkness and i lookt upward for awhile and was much held by the mighty uplands that did be on high yet did lie utter far below the burning crests of the mountains and showed vague and sombre and dreadful seeming because that they did be so lost upward and to have the mystery of the red shining and of the shadows upon them and to seem to slope far under the great fires but yet to be a place where no life should ever come because that they did be so monstrous a way upward beyond the great shoulders of the hills the which did be themselves a huge way up and truly i should give you somewhat of the affecting of those grim and unknown uplands if that i said they did seem to my fancy to be a place where a sorrowful thing might wander lost forever but why i to think this thing how shall i say and do tell it to you only because that it doth seem to hold in the thought the grimness and utter desolation of those high and lonesome lands and by this i was done looking and turned me about and so did find that mine own did stand silent and waited that i come to my slumber and surely i lookt at her but she did have her lids something downward when that she saw me turn and so in the end i said naught but went to my sleep and had the diskos very handy as ever beside me and i then to know that mine own did lie down beside me to my back as alway and this to gladden me as you shall think for i perceived afresh how thin did be the crust of her naughtiness and i to be alway stirred and touched in the heart by her loving naturalness that did need alway that she be near to me save when she did play this naughtiness upon me along the way and i saw that she had no mind to be perverse whilst that i did slumber but must now be nigh unto me and quietly loving though nowise truly ceased from her naughty acting that i did be as an hard slave master because that i had whipt her yet she to have somewhat a truce with me as my heart did know but indeed she not to kiss me good night upon the mouth in her dear usual and sober fashion and surely i did lie awhile and pondered upon the maid and upon all her ways and i perceived that she kist me not only because that she did not be able to break utter from her perverseness that did come from the stirring of her nature and truly i did love her and was half minded that i turn about to her and take her a moment into mine arms but yet to abide from this because that i was set that i wait awhile and to bring her to me thiswise mayhaps and presently i knew that the maid kist mine armour very quiet and shy because that she must kiss me yet to be intent that i have no knowledge of this pretty act but indeed i did know in all my being and did be newly tender unto her yet to say naught and to wait and thus i knew presently that her breathing did go easy so that i perceived that she was all content and gone over unto slumber somewise as a little child that doth be weary and doth sleep without care and with happy assurance and in verity did a man ever to have so sweet and gentle a maid that did be in the same time so troublous and perverse and i to lie yet awhile and to note the constant tremble and shake of the rock that did be under us and this to be alway thus as i did lie and to be the more plain because that i did be quiet in thought and this as i conceived did come from the earth shaking that was made by the inward fire of the world the which did make a vague trouble in all that part of the land and then in a little i was gone over into sleep and waked not for seven good hours and then to hear the fizzing of the water very brisk and cheerful and so to have mine eyes open in a moment and to know by my time keeper or dial that was somewhat like to a watch of this age that i had slumbered through seven good hours but this to be learned after that i had lookt to see whether mine own did be well and whether that the boulder did balance in the mouth part of the cave and surely there did be nothing in harm for the boulder was there as i did put it and the maid a little off from me and did make ready the water and the tablets that we eat before our journeying and i rose then and in the same moment i did know that my mouth had been kist whilst that i slept and the knowing to come to me vague as that i had been kist in my dreams and i lookt over toward the maid but she to have her lids something down upon her eyes and to seem very demure so that i saw her naughtiness was come again upon her yet truly i could not bear that i not to have her into mine arms for indeed her perverseness did seem as that she did the more tempt me unto her and thus i came to her in a moment but she neither to resist me nor to give herself unto me but only to be still in mine arms and to do no more than submit very quiet and because of this i loost her unkist and was silent and a little to be angered even whilst that my heart perceived the way of the working of her heart yet truly i ached now that she come back to her dear natural fashion and i eat my tablets and drank some of the water and the maid to do likewise and afterward i lookt well from the mouth of the cave but did nowhere see aught to put me in trouble for our safety though truly as presently i saw there went an herd of strange creatures afar off in the northwestward part which did be that way of the country beyond the feet of the mountains toward the in land now when that i was something assured of the safeness of the way i gat the diskos to my hip and the maid to have the scrip and the pouch ready to my back and her bundle to her hand and so all to be ready and i went downward from the cave when that i was girt and gave aid to mine own and so to be soon upon the journey and surely as we went onward and i to look about me with different seeing eyes from my looking on mine outward way i to see how wondrous this part of the land did be and how that it did be truly like a great and wondrous park that did be made of the skill and labour of godlike things and truly this to show my feeling as i lookt all ways and all that part did be bred of the inward forces of the world and did be burned clear in this place and upheaved in that and made to an hot lake in another part and odd whiles there to go a great steam fountain that did whistle a lonely song forever and anon there to be a small wood and again a wood and oft the quietness of great and strange trees that did stand alone and here and in that part a little fire hill that did be surely no greater than an house and we to pass seven of these in but three hours and two to glow very steadfast and to make no vigour of burning but the five others did burn very strong and sent out a smoke and ash and made a small desolation all about them and of these five there did be one that cast stones oft and again so that they went upward with a strange loud noise and fell in this place and that all about so that we came downward more nigh to the shore that we be a good way off and here as i do mind there was a strangeness in that there did be many trees that had stones set in the branches and this to be plainly the work of the little fire hill and i to think it but something new come else surely there had been no trees within all that space that it did throw but yet mayhap i am wrong in this for all things did seem that they grew very easy in that country and indeed this to be for surprise to me only that i saw it with mine own eyes as we do say and alway as we did go there were signs of inward life and forces so that we but to stand quiet to feel that the earth did tremble gently in many parts and presently there sounded for a great while a low and dull booming sound and this we found to be from a place amid certain great rocks toward the mountains for there came thence a mighty up spouting of boiling water that went so high as an hundred feet and oft to be thrice so high and belched a great steam and there went up in the jet of the water a great rock that was so big as an house and did dance and play in the might of the water as that it had been no more than a thing very light and easy and when that the water fell as it did oft the rock to go downward with the dull booming that we did hear and i minded how that i had heard the booming upon mine outward way but had been then something more to the shore so that it had been less plain to mine ears as you shall suppose neither had it been then to my sight as now it did be to us because that we were come mayhap the half of a mile more toward the in land of the country and truly we lookt awhile at this huge great fountain and up boiling and came nearer unto it but yet to be a large space off because of the way that it did throw out a spattering of small stones odd whiles and surely the thing did cough and roar in the deep earth and anon to gruntle gently and to sob and gurgle and lo to come forth in a moment with a bellow very hollow and strange and the great rock to go spinning upward and all a shine in the light from the volcanoes and was so round as a monstrous ball and polished by the fret of the waters so that i saw it had surely danced in the great jet through a weary time and anon the jet to cease and to go downward with a great soughing and thundering of waters and the dancing rock to fall downward from that height which did show very huge now that we did be come so near and the rock surely to fall backward into some deep pit whence came the waters and as it fell there was again the dull booming but why the rock brake not i could not perceive save that it did alway fall into a boiling up of waters and had no hurt from the rock of the place whence it was come and the maid and i both to have stood a while that we stare at this thing for it did be more strange than i have made you to know but now i did make to our journey again and did think the maid followed but lo in a moment when that i lookt she was to my back and went toward the great boiling fountain then i stopt very swift and called to her but she did take no heed of me and went onward very naughty unto the danger of the great boil of the jet and the constant flying out of the stones that you do know now even as i stood and lookt the maid drew nigh to the place where the water did thunder and the jet in that moment to bellow so that i knew it came upward again and i ran then after the maid and she to see me and began likewise to run from me toward the monstrous fountain and surely i did think that i had done well if that i had whipt or beat her proper before this time for truly it did be as that her naughtiness had gone nigh unto somewhat that did be near to a wayward madness so that as i did perceive all her nature did surely work in her toward some deed that should be for regret and this to come because that she did be something pusht from her dear balance by her loving and by the acting of my manhood upon her so that her nature both to be in rebellion against me and to need me and all in the same time and this way she to be in an inward turmoil and to be ready foolishly that she put in danger her beloved life if only thereby she to make me something adrift and in the same moment to have some ease of her perverseness and in verity you to know all this because that i have shown the working of her heart to you before this time now i caught the maid among the great rocks which did stand all about and before her there did be a monstrous pit whence came the upbursting of the water and the water to go upward before our faces in a mighty column so that it did be as that a sea shot up on end into a pillar of living water and went upward forever as it did seem in that moment and how we should be saved i knew not for the water did be as that it overhung us and should come down upon us and smother us in one moment forever and the roar was in our ears and shook all the air of that place with sound as of an harsh and dreadful thunder and there was a scalding of beaten water as fine as an haze all about us and i had the maid in one instant into mine arms and i ran very swift with a fierce running that i have her away speedy and so made forlorn trial that i save her life and lo as i went from under that huge and dreadful overhang of the great waters there came downward from the height a great stone that had been cast by the jet and it burst upon the rock to my back and certain of the flinders did strike and ring upon mine armour and made me to stagger as i ran but i held the maid crowded safe against my breast and she did not be hurt and truly i was yet able to run and did save mine own and brought her out from under that grim spouting and i put the maid down then to her feet and she not to know how near that she had given us to death neither of the way that the fragments did strike me for she laughed very naughty and gleeful but truly i laughed not for my heart had been nigh husht with terror for her so that i did be yet sick in my spirit and mayhap also something shaken by the blows that i gat from the broken stone and in verity i to have meant that i flog her very sharp if that there be no other way that i might bring her to reason for in surety as you to see she to be acting so wild as a child and so unreasoning as only a maid in love and i to know that she did have to be brought back from this way of spirit even though i have to hurt her pretty body that i bring her again to her dear natural wiseness yet indeed i could not whip her then because that she did laugh so joyous though with a naughty heart and did look so wondrous dainty so that even her defyings did but seem that which my heart desired and you mayhap to have been something likewise in the love days yet i pled and reasoned with her to be a wise maid but indeed she only to make a gleeful mock of all that i did say now i went forward again for i was not harmed by the stone only that i did be shaked as you shall think and the maid to go offward from me and to sing and did oft dance naughtily as she went but truly i did be silent with her for i was but human and did lack that she come to mine arms and love me because that i had pluckt her safe from that place and indeed this to be but a natural desiring and you to have understanding with me and to know that you also to have this lack and need if that you to have done aught for love of your maid and she to deny you a word of loving tenderness yet in verity i to be even then able to perceive with mine inward senses how that the maid did have a wondrous up pouring of love for me but yet did be so perverse and the more so mayhap because that her love did so urge her unto loving admittings that i did be her man and she maybe to have meant that she be the more humble presently but yet to go naughtily awhile more and not indeed to have had the power within her at that time to have come unto me and cast off her waywardness and askt that she be in mine arms as all my heart did desire and so as i have told i went silently and mayhap with a little dullness that did be part of anger and part of hurt and part of that same strange love foolishness from which the maid did suffer and truly this doth be very contrary seeming only that you have seen my heart and all indeed the more human that it doth be so contrariwise to the brain reason and all to be desired else did a man be no better than an ant or a weariful machine and this to be truth and wholesomeness as you shall perceive if that you look deep enough and do modify reason with heart understanding for in verity how shall that which we call reason bring any to the full and the great knowledge and this doth be a power of holy things and doth be a child that is born of love and reason and in the one to hold the two and to know all things is the gift of this power so that no man may walk truly that hath only the first neither any man do utter wise that hath only the second and surely i to cease from these thoughts and to my tellings and you to your harkings and dear sympathy now when the sixth hour did be come we made a halt and eat and drank and afterward went onward again and so came presently clear of the two monstrous fire hills and their great noise to be presently to our rear and likewise that quiet country that did be round their feet and did seem so utter husht and strange and doubly so because of the upward noise of the mountains and because of the slow and subtle earth shaking that did be so constant and because of all those things that i have told now when we had made halt the maid had done her hair very uncomely upon her head and had lookt slyly to see whether i did note but truly i took no heed so that in the end she had it again in a pretty fashion and did sing naughtily and with an heart of mischief as she did shape it loose and wondrous nice about her head and i still to have no word for her neither to show that i did watch her with love and somewise a quaint pleasure of her perverseness even whilst that i did strive by silence and an aloofness that i bring her to my side as she did be in the first days for truly i did ache that she be near unto me and to cease from her waywardness that did put a distance of spirit between us as you to perceive and so we did go forward again as i have told and the maid did strive that she make me to give attention to her naughtiness for she did walk alway offward from me and did sing aloud and truly they did be songs strange unto me but yet to be of love and much as the songs of this age for truly there doth be but one song upon all the earth and she but to sing it in diverse ways and she did oft to make little glancing toward me and did pout very pretty and in a moment come something toward me as that she did be humble and would be forgiven but all to be in a naughty mockery so that in verity i lookt not at her save odd whiles but did go forward alway and made as that i had no heed of her doings and surely this did presently to stir her to a new defying and to a pretty anger for she did sing other songs of impudence that she did fit very clever about me and this way to have a constant impertinence and so we did go and i never to speak with the maid but to wonder when that she cease or how long it should be ere that i did run swift to her and have her into mine arms that i shake her and kiss her all as my heart did desire and when that the twelfth hour did be come we made halt again and eat and drank and the maid to serve me very intent and hand me the water the while that she went down upon her knee as a slave but when i would have laughed gently at her mockings and taken her into mine arms she went from me very sudden and cold and was afterward silent and did sit apart from me now i also did be silent and in the first because that i was a little pained and also because that i did be new touched with the love foolishness that did trouble mine own but afterward i ceased from these feelings and did be intent to another matter for it did seem to my spirit that there was some danger anigh to us and i had a thought of the humpt men and lookt well about and did beckon the maid to come nigh because that the trees did be plentiful thereabout to hide any creature but mine own came not over to me so that i loosed the diskos from mine hip and went that i be nigh to her and she made that she saw me not but did set the gear together and had it presently a ready for the journey the while that i did look all ways among the trees but indeed i saw naught and when that i had the gear upon me and the maid her bundle we went forward again and i to be very wary and bid the maid keep close to my side but indeed she would not obey and went offward among the trees so that i was all an haunted with dread for her and ran and caught her and talkt wisely with her but indeed she did not hark to me but did run off in the moment that i loost her and i caught her again and i took one of the straps from around the scrip and the pouch and set it about her pretty waist and the end i held in my hand and so had her to obey me in this thing which did be needful to her safety and the maid to go with me very husht for two great hours and i alway to look well about and in the end of that time the maid did begin to sing impudently and i did ask her that she be a quiet maid lest that she bring danger upon us but she to be the more impudent and lo as i did strive that i look all ways lest any harm did come upon us and in the same moment to reason mine own from her pretty folly she did grow very husht so that i lookt round upon her in an instant and truly she had cut the strap with her belt knife and did run away very swift among the trees and surely my heart did slow a little in my breast because that there did seem something a move in the dark of the shadows where the trees did grow thick and the maid did run that way in her foolishness and waywardness and i ran hard after the maid and did call her not over loud lest i bring somewhat upon her but she to have no heed and to run very light and swift so that i caught her not for the half of a minute as it might be for she was gone ahead and i did be a little cumbered with mine armour and lo when i caught her i shook her and pointed inward among the trees for it did seem even then to me that something moved there but she to struggle in my hand a moment and afterward to be still and to ask with an insolence and a defiance whether that i did mean to flog my chattel the which she did call herself in her naughtiness and in verity ere i did know she had twist from me and did run with a true wickedness straight toward that place where somewhat had seemed to be a move and i ran then with all my strength and with a fearful and an anxious heart and because i put all my strength to the matter i caught the maid in a moment ere she did be gone any way and she again to fight to be gone from me but i took her into mine arms very strong and i ran outward from that place where the trees made a darkness and surely when i was come again to where the trees did be more spare i saw that i was come nigh to that river which i crost on the raft as you shall mind and truly i did be glad and to feel safe in a moment yet i was firm now to my purpose for i set the maid to the earth upon her feet and kept my hold very sure upon her for i did mean that i whip her before that her love foolishness bring her needless unto death and i took the belt from her pretty waist for it did be but a light strap and i whipt her very sharp over her shoulders with the belt and truly she did make to nestle unto me in a moment as that other time when that i whipt her but i stayed her from this and i set the belt thrice more across her shoulders very sharp so that she to learn wisdom at once and i to be free for ever of this need to pain her which did hurt me very strange and the maid to stand very quiet now that i did keep her from coming unto me and her head did be something bent so that i knew not whether i did mayhap have flogged her over hard for i did be something lacking in knowledge whether that a maid be very easy hurt and i stooped and lookt into her face and lo she did be smiling naughtily and kist me in a moment very saucy upon the mouth ere i did be aware and afterward she laughed and made try to make a bitter mock upon me and askt when that i should be pleased to cease from whipping my chattel for that then she should run away immediately into the wood and to trust the humpt men that they protect her from me and surely i lookt at her very grave for i perceived that she did not truly jest but made to anger me and did be half in a strange anger herself and something adrift for she had not been whipt enough but only to stir her rebellion utterly and i saw that if she be not set right then ere she leave my hand she to be like to have some new foolishness that should take her unto her death even as she had come overnear already as you to know and this to be because that her nature did be stirred so that her natural wiseness was all overset and she to be that she do aught of unwisdom that should come to her because of her pretty love foolishness which did now be made the more strong by reason of the half rising of her anger and this way as i have known i perceived that for her dear sake i should not let my lovingness weaken me in that moment and in verity i shifted my hand and loosed the fastenings of her garment so that her pretty shoulders did be bared and her face to change sudden and she lookt up at me an instant with a little gasp so that i knew she did be all unbroken as was mine intent but she did not yet have learned deeply in her heart all that i was minded that she to learn for even in that moment she made a sound that showed she did try to mock me but truly she did not know in that instant whether to mock or to weep though she did try to suppose that she had yet an heart for mockery and i set the belt thrice across her pretty shoulders where they did be bared and surely the blows did be very stern and sharp and lo in one moment mine own broke into an utter weeping so that i took her instant into mine arms and did hold her strong and gentle against mine armour and she to be as a child in mine arms and did sob very strange and bitter as that she did be all undone in the heart and presently she did be quiet in mine arms though i to feel how she did yet tremble and she did cling tight unto me and her face to be against mine armour and afterward when that she had ceased to tremble i kist her and surely her mouth did be very humble and her lids to be downward and she to be something pale and she then to be awhile more in mine arms very quiet and so to come unto her dear self and lo presently she to want to kiss me of her own accord and she put up her lips very sweet and as a loving maid that i kiss her and surely i kist her with an humble and a masterful love and a strange pain to be about my heart as you shall suppose but yet my heart and my reason both to approve mine action and the maid to be but the more mine own and to have come again to her dear natural wisdom yet as you shall know there to be for a long while a strange and mixed pain in my bosom both dreadful and tender because that i had been so stern with mine own maid so that even while that my heart and my reason did approve me my heart to make somewhat of reproach and this to have been someways of foolishness but yet human of our nature and an wholesome trouble to the spirit if that this troubling be not allowed to shape our actions to any harmful weakness now in a while the maid did come to composedness and to be very gentle and sweetly natural and she made presently that she would have me to loose her and afterward she turned her back to me even as a dear child that i fasten her garment again upon the shoulders and she did be both shy and glad and humble and in dainty pride of submission and utter mine own and surely as i did this thing for her i perceived that she lookt with a great shyness at the belt which did be yet in my hand and when that i had made an end of fastening her garment she did nestle unto me for a while and afterward stood away and made shyly to show me that i put her belt again about her pretty waist and i saw that she did be somewhat a lack yet that she touch the belt because that i had whipt her with it and truly you to perceive how her heart did be in this matter but if you not to know then how shall i to tell you and do but bid you ask your own maid though in verity she to be like that she but laugh at you and leave you so wise as you be now for the way of the heart of a maid doth be most hid to the maid and she but to know the desire and to lack the ending but truly she doth know when that a man shall set the truth of her heart before her now when i had buckled the belt very nice again about mine own we went backward a space until that we found the bundle which she had dropt when that she ran off from me and i saw also the portion of the strap which she cut and so all to be found and we went then at a good speed toward the river for i was still minded regarding the seeming of movement which there had been among the trees and very wishful that we have a raft made with haste so that we might come to the little island where i did sleep before upon the outward way as you shall remember and i thought to have our slumber again in that place and to make that day's journeying something short because that the island was near and a good and safe place for our sleeping and i told the maid concerning the island and she to be in great delight and interest because that it did be one of those halts of mine outward going and did be all eager as a child when that i said we should truly have need of a raft to come to the island and we came downward to the shore of the river and indeed there did be those two same trees that had been my raft there upon the shore of that place and i showed these to mine own and truly she did nigh to weep upon them because of her dear emotions and love and did cut a small branch therefrom with her belt knife and put the branch where she did put the piece of bark and this to be for a remembrance and an after delight and pondering now we lookt well in all parts that we find some other small tree that should be fallen and the maid did climb a rock that did be near with a flat top so that she might search out around and presently she cried out to me that there did be a tree to our purpose and but an hundred paces away and she to go with me to show me and to aid if need be but indeed i carried the tree very easy and had it with the others and afterward we went about again for branches and these i cut from live trees using the diskos with care and wiseness and with these branches to be for cross pieces and our belts and the straps for binders i set the trees together into a raft and made it pretty good for our need and so that no monstrous thing in the river should have chance to snap upward between the trees at my dear one and when the raft was done i gat it to the water and the maid did lend her strength for the thing was heavy as you shall think and when this was done i pushed a sharp branch downward into the shore and i hookt a branch of the raft about this mooring and so did be nigh ready for the voyage but first i did need a pole to push the raft and did wonder now where the other did be gone that i cut upon the outward way for i had set the pole with the two trees as i did mind having some vague thought that mayhap i should live to come that way again and i had a little strange unease that the pole did be gone but scarce to know that i did be troubled yet to set me to a new haste and i bid the maid put the scrip and the pouch and her bundle secure upon the raft and in that time i lookt well about for a sapling tree that should do my purpose and i saw that there grew an odd one a little to the side of the flat topt rock that the maid had lookt from and whilst that i cut it the maid did come to watch and made pretty chatter in the time that i trimmed the branches away and lo whilst that i did be part divided in mine attention between her dear talk and my work and an haste that did be born of that little unease that was come upon me my spirit to seem to be aware that there came a danger anigh to us and the maid to have this same knowing for she ceased her speech and lookt at me with somewhat of trouble and lo in that moment as i balanced the pole in my hands there came the noise of a sudden bounding to our backward part where the trees did grow something anigh and i turned instant and lookt and behold there did be upon us an humpt man very lumpish and mighty and he stretched out his hands and ran at me and i had no time to the diskos which did be upon the earth to my feet and i smote the humpt man with the point of the pole that did be in my hands and the point took him very strong and horrid in the breast and entered in so that the humpt man gave out a strange howling that did be half seeming of an animal and half of an human and he clutched at the pole that did so hurt him and i stoopt very swift for the diskos and had it in a moment and the humpt man tore the pole out of his breast and in the same instant i ript him from the head downward so that he did be nigh in two halves for i had no mercy in mine act even though my heart did be something sorry now even as the man died there did be a sound of running in the wood before me and lo i turned very speedy to the maid and she was there to my back and had her belt knife drawn in her hand for she had it in her bosom where she had put it when that i took her belt for the raft and i caught the maid about the waist with my left arm and was come with her to the top of the rock in two great houndings and i set her there upon the rock and turned again to the way i came and swung the diskos free for indeed i had seen that there did come a number of the humpt men among the trees and there came running from the wood mayhaps a great score of the humpt men so that it did seem to me that we did be going to die for how should one stand against so many and they so quick and strong as you shall mind yet in verity i had no despair but did be mixt in the heart with a great fear for mine own and a strange and exulting gladness that i should do that day some deed for mine own maid and truly this to be the pomp of love and the heart cry of the barbarian as you shall say and this maybe but truly i did be proper human and to make no excuse because that i was natural neither have i hid anywheres aught that i did think and feel and whether that you approve or not if that you condemn me you to condemn all humanity and to have vain words and vain regrettings for these things that be named for faults do but be the complement of our virtues and if that you slay the first you may chance to wither the last for now i speak of things as they be now and as they did be then and nowise of lovely ideals that do live chief in the mind and so much in mine as any as you to know if that you have gone with me all along my way and surely i must cease from my thinkings and go forward with my telling for the humpt men did come forward at a wondrous quick run and did swarm upward on to the rock as that they did be panthers and they made no outcry but came silent to the killing and i saw that they did be something smaller than he that i had but then slain and in verity i did be all knit in that moment with speed and cleverness for i split the heads of three with but quick turns of my wrist as i did wield the diskos and i kicked the face of another in the same time with my metal boot so that he died for there did be all my strength and all my skill working then for our salvation now all this to have been done in but a few beats of the heart as i might say and these men to have been in the front of the attacking yet there did be no space to have breath for there leaped three more of the men upon the rock and one smote me with a great piece of rock that he carried so that mine armour did seem as that it crackt and i to be driven backward upon the maid yet had slain one of the humpt men even in that moment and surely my dear one caught me in her arms behind and steadied me so that i fell not and i slew the humpt man with the rock even in that moment whilst mine own held me as he came again to strike me and i then to be firm again upon my feet and did spring at the third of the humpt men and surely there was no room that he should be able to avoid me even did that be his intent and he came at me with a great leap and i stood strong looking clearly to my work and i swung the diskos with both my hands and the blow took the humpt man in the middle part and split him whilst that he did be yet leaping and in that instant there reached over the edge of the rock two of the humpt men and gat me by the feet so that i was pulled sudden to my back very hard and bitter and this to be done even whilst that the body of the humpt man did be yet in the air and the body came forward over me and did be utter dead already and fell down upon the rock beyond me and rolled horridly and went over the edge of the rock and i did be all shaken and something bemused by the hardness of my fall and the hands of the two humpt men pluckt me sharp to the edge of the rock the while that i did strike vaguely to wound them but did only chip the rock and fortunate that i harmed not the weapon and lo in the moment that they had been like to have me downward to the earth into their midst i to make a good stroke for i cut the shoulder of one very dreadful so that he loosed me and immediately i kicked very fierce with my freed foot and surely i nigh crushed the hand of that other with my metal boot and he likewise to cease from dragging upon me and immediately i knew that mine own did be helping me that i get instant to my feet again for i was yet something dazed and there came then a rush of the humpt men up the rock and truly it did be a glad thing for our lives that they might come up only upon but one side for the other sides did be utter steep and smooth worn and this to have been unto our saving as you shall think and i stood up to the rush of the humpt men and did smite hard at them with a quick circling of the diskos so that the great weapon did glow and roar and they gave back from the blaze and the sound of the diskos and surely then i ran in upon them whilst that they did be something bewildered and i gat the foremost man full upon the head so that he did be dead before he did know what thing happened yet in verity this did be a dread moment to me for the humpt men leaped in at me upon every side in an instant of time and i did be struck upon my head piece and upon my back and breast with the stones that certain of them did carry so that i rockt as i stood and did near to swoon and mine armour to be all dint and bent upon me and i truly to seem that i had come to the time of my dying and lo in that moment of time there did come to my dazed sense a low and bitter cry of anguish from the maid and this to set all my life aglow in me and in verity there went a strange greyness of fury before mine eyes and i then to fight as i did never fight before and i did smite as it did seem forever and the greyness did ease from mine eyes and the maid did have her arms about me as i stood and the dead men to lie heapt upon the rock and mine own to steady me for i did be near slain and the blood did go from me and mine armour was all broke upon me by the smitings of the sharp stones and i lookt something slowly upon mine own and she to know that i would ask whether that she did be harmed anywise and she to be very brave with me and to tell me that she did be well and she to be all slain in the heart because that i did be so hurt but truly i had fought a good fight and did lack only to know that she come to no harm now my wits did come back into me very soon but i did be utter weak and scarce to stand so that i did mind only that i get mine own safe unto the raft and to put off then from the shore and i walkt slow to the edge of the rock and lookt well about that i learn whether the humpt men did be all gone away and the maid did steady me and lo there came up in that instant the last of the humpt men and they were five and did creep very stealthy that they have me in surprise and i loost from the maid for i saw that i must come upon them whilst that i had any strength left in my body and they now to leap upward unto me so that i gat the first upon the head and he to go backward dead but truly i did be more weak than i knew for i swayed upon the edge of the rock and sudden i went downward to the earth and did be there upon my knees and my back to the rock and in verity the humpt men did come in upon me very swift yet did they give back from the diskos which i swung to and fro so speedy as i might for my weakness which did be so utter that i could nowise come to my feet to stand and mine own came down swiftly from the rock and ran past the humpt men and i to make that i shout to her to go to the raft but truly i had no voice in my body and did be dumb and weak and did know that i should be gone forever from mine own in a little moment and she to have none to protect her neither to know the way of our journey save by reason and behold mine own did shout to the humpt men and i perceived that she made to draw them after her for she ran to and fore and did shout continually but indeed the humpt men had no heed of her but did make alway to come at me and surely in that moment one of the humpt men reached me and smote me so shrewd that sure he nigh crackt his monstrous hand upon mine armour and did drive me backward upon the rock and to make me bleed afresh so that i was all in a daze and near swooned away and the humpt man caught at the diskos yet in verity he loost it on the instant for it did burn and shake him very sore and immediately he smote me again and so made to end me and lo in that moment the maid ran right in among the humpt men and she struck the man that strove with me and drove her belt knife once and again through his arm very savage and determined and surely the man turned upon her and he caught her by her garments and he ript her two garments utter from her so that they came away and she did be free and behold mine utter despair for her did give me a new strength so that i shouted to her that she run instant to the raft and i cut the humpt man in twain and did fall back then into a part swoon against the rock and lo the maid ran out from the humpt men but they neither to know whether that they follow her or that they come in upon me and as they did pause she to call to them and to try that she tempt them from me toward the wood for she had no thought of her life but only that she free me and save me and i too weak even to have power to command her to the raft and she truly to have no heed to such command even did i thus to call again and there i did be half gone out from this life and lookt at her with eyes that did scarce wot save as in a dream and lo the humpt men ceased sudden that they heed her and the three that did be left came very sly unto me and with slowness and cunning for they wotted not whether i did be dead or but a wait for them and the maid perceived that they came not after her and she let out a great cry that did be distant seeming in my dulled ears and came back naked and running very swift and she ran by me as death should run white and silent and her face set unto despair and her eyes utter intent and she struck her belt knife into the shoulder of the near humpt man and the man howled and turned and she did leap to the side and the humpt man ran at her but lo she leaped again this way and that and utter silent and so quick as a light doth seem to dance all ways in a moment and the two other men did join with the first that they catch her and behold she went about and did run right away among the trees and the three men did come after her running very lumbersome yet with a great speed and the maid had the knife in her hand and i knew that she did mean to slay herself presently when that she could run no more and in that moment it seemed that my heart burst for that i should never more see mine own maid forever and there came some power of movement into me and i came forward from the rock and fell over upon my face and i gat again to my knees and began that i creep after the maid and i did shout in whispers for my voice had no more power to call and the maid went from my sight among the trees as a far white figure that did run very swift and was presently lost utter to my sight and the humpt men did go after yet even in my weakness i perceived that two did go something clumsy as that they had been hurt in the fight and they to be the rearward of the chasing but he that the maid did cut with the knife was to the fore and did run very strong and surely they were all gone inward of the trees with a dreadful speed and were lost from me and the world did become sudden an emptyness and a great horror and there was no sound in all the earth as it did seem and i knew that i was come to my feet and did run toward the trees and the diskos did trail from mine arm by the hold buckle and the ground did be as that it moved and shifted under me and i not to feel where i trod but did only peer desperate and lost among the trees and as i to know now i heard my voice calling strangely and afterward there was a thundering in mine ears and i came downward upon my face and i did know presently that i was alive and there to be some dreadful terror at my heart and surely i did remember and sickened and gat my head from the ground and i lookt among the trees but there did be nothing and everywhere there did be a strange silence and a dimness of unreal seemings and i knew that mine own was gone from me and had surely died and the earth did be all stained about me with my blood and i did be utter glad for i to need death and i swooned again and was lost to my pain but did live presently to know and there was a little strength come into me and i gat my head up somewhat from the ground and did peer among the trees and my head did be too heavy and my face came against the earth once more and because that i could not hold up my head i rolled my head a little until that my cheek did be to the ground and i to look thiswise so well as i might but there did be nothing and afterward i rolled my head again to the other cheek and so to stare very weak and desperate and not abled to look proper to my front and lo there went something among the trees and did show white in the gloom of the wood and did come through the trees and i not to believe in the first that i did truly see aught and sudden i to know that i saw somewhat and behold my heart did bound in me so that all my body did waken for i knew that mine own maid did run slow and staggering toward me through the wood and i did be now upon my knees and upon my hands and did begin again to creep and to bleed and did make little callings to mine own that had no sounding and mine own drew nigh and did rock and stagger and did strike anon against the trunks of the trees as that she did be gone near blind with her running and in a moment she saw me and that i did yet live and did come unto her and she made a strange and loving crying unto me with a great gladness and with an utter weakness and she came running and was lost with faintness and did sway this way and that stumbling and she went sudden to the earth and did be still and i crept onward so speedy as i might and the earth to seem alway as that it moved from my hands and to slide and this seeming to be of my weakness for my hands and my knees went everyway and my head to be that it kept nodding forward very stupid to the earth and lo as i came anigh unto the maid where she did lie so quiet i saw that something moved in the wood and was running and truly it did be an humpt man and came forward very silent and with a quick slyness as that he did track the maid secretly for he lookt alway to the earth and i perceived that he was that one of the humpt men which the maid had cut with the knife for the blood did show upon the shoulder and the breast and this bleeding mayhap to have slowed the man so that mine own did be like to have supposed she had come utter free yet he to have found her by tracking as i perceived and i strave to my feet that i should come to the maid before the humpt man and surely i gat upright and went with a strange running and did roll and lo i fell immediate ere i was come to her and the humpt man to run also and surely it did be a dreadful race for i went creeping and did be weak and as that i was of lead and the humpt man came very swift and brutish but i came the first to mine own maid and i rose up at the humpt man upon my knees and i swung the diskos and the great weapon did roar in my hands as that it did know and did live and the humpt man ran in upon me but i smote him truly with the diskos and he ran past me all blundering and fell and died upon his face a little way off and lo my wounds had brake out into a great bleeding and my head did roll upon my shoulders and i lookt down dull yet with an utter great love upon mine own and there did be no proper wound upon her but yet was she all bruised and knockt and marked with the trees and where she did fall in her running and she did be there very still and dear and i to have brake my heart with love for her but that i did be so dulled as i have told and i fought that i should be strong a little while more against my weakness and i strove that i set mine ear gently upon her breast that i should listen for her heart but my head did go downward something clumsy and heavy upon her and i then to hearken and surely she did live and her heart did beat though in verity mine ears did have at first a thundering but afterward a quietness in them that made the sounding of her pulsing to seem an utter long way off and very faint it did be and surely in that moment even as i harked i was gone over into a deadness and had no more knowing neither to have even a knowledge that i did be slipt from my senses and behold the maid did lie swooning and i to be there in my broken armour and my head upon the breast of mine own and likewise to know naught and about us the quietness of that country and the far noise of the great fire hills that did sound through eternity xiv on the island now i came unto my senses and did be in pain and a great forgetfulness and bewilderment and i strove that i rise but did be held by a strange force that did be surely my weakness as i to know afterward and i was upon my back and a little sound did be near me as that something did pant and i turned my head very slow because that i did so lack of strength and lo i saw that the maid did be anigh to me and did be yet naked and did pant and pusht hard and desperate with a great pole which did be surely that one which i had cut when that the humpt men came upon us and therewith i remembered all and perceived that i did be upon the raft and the maid to push the raft along with the pole and at that i made a little sound with my mouth but the maid not to hear me for she did look backward as i should think to the shore and her face did be very set and anxious and there to be a far noise of howling that i knew to be the voices of the humpt men and so to perceive that the maid had come unto her senses and had gat me somewise to the raft whilst that i did yet be swoond and thus to save me ere the humpt men had come but in verity how she did this thing i never to learn neither she to know but only that her love did give her a great and desperate strength that she save me that did be her man and afterward mine own maid did tell me how that she had come into her senses and did be there upon the earth and somewhat did be upon her breast and she saw that it was my head which did be heavy upon her and i to be surely gone out from this life for i was so still and she came from under me and did ease me out upon the earth and her heart nigh brake because that i was so be bled and my blood to have stained all that did be near but when she had gat me restful she saw that i did surely live and a great hope to spring in her heart and oft as she had eased me she had lookt about and there did be naught to the sight save the body of the humpt man anigh and the others dead about and upon the flat topped rock as you to mind and she ran then very speedy to the raft and brought water from the river in my headpiece and she dasht the water upon me but i to have no power to come unto my senses and lo in that moment she to know by some subtile telling of the spirit that there came some danger anigh and she then to make that she save me or that we die both of us together and she strave with me and did carry and draw me that weariful way unto the raft and she gat me on to the raft and she ran then for the pole that did be beside the rock and whilst that she took the pole she perceived her torn garments that did be yet in the hands of the humpt man even as she had slipt them to escape him and she caught the garments very hasty from the hand of the man and ran then to the raft and she pusht the raft out from the shore and leaped aboard and behold as she made to use the pole there came a sound out of the wood and there ran from the wood the two humpt men that did yet live and they to have trackt her after that she did run from them and they ran downward to the shore very silent and intent upon her but she to work with an utter despair and to have the raft a good way out ere they did be come and surely they either to have no power of swimming or to know that there did be a dread in the water for they made not to come after but did stand and stare very stupid and afterward to howl and this howling i did hear when that i was come unto myself upon the raft as you do know and by this telling you to be so wise as i for more i know not save odd things that i did learn afterward that did but set my love more holy unto mine own maid and these to have been but small matters of love thoughts that we did have together and scarce clear unto my remembering and lo even as i harked unto the howling of the humpt men the sound did grow more faint and far off for the maid worked very desperate with the pole and i did feel that i would help her but yet was so a lack and surely even as i did mean to rise i was gone again utter from my senses and that dear naked one did pilot me safe and loving unto the safe harbouring of the little island that you do mind and had no thought unto herself but only that she save me and i to be there scarce offward from my death and to have no knowing of aught and no more power to help or to be a shield unto mine own but did be only an helpless man that had surely died save for the care of my beloved yet did i fight a good fight and have alway a great joy in the remembering now i mind nothing very clear after this for a great time but only of pain and weariness and of half wakings and times when i did know naught and others when that i did be awake yet did have no realness either in myself or in any land or place and all to come back strange and vague yet with a constant knowing that there went love about me and a great and gentle watchfulness so that i was eased when that the black mists of my weakness did uprise about me to swamp me and i was made to know hope when that unknown despairs did live stealthy within me and lo there came a time when i waked and did be freed of uncertain burdenings and peculiar woes and that still haze through which great achings did come constant upon me and surely i was laid very nice upon somewhat that did be soft and there went a sweet quietness about me and an healthful drowse did grow in my bones and slowly i perceived that the maid did kneel beside me and did look upon me with so great a love and gladness that it did be as that i drank in health and a drowsy joy and peace and surely she stoopt and kiss me with an utter gentle love upon my mouth and her tears to go sweet upon my face and truly i kist her again with an utter content and she took my head in the comfort of her arm and gave me somewhat that i drink and when i had drunk she kiss me once again so light as that a pretty wind did blow hushed upon my lips and my head she made easy and lo i was gone over unto sleep even as she tended me and thrice do i mind that this to happen and at the third time i knew that my strength was come something into me again and i moved my hand a little this way and that and she to know that i did need her to hold my hand and she to do this and i to go into sleep again even while that i look sleepy yet with all my love into her eyes and when i waked for the fourth time i did whisper that i loved her and surely she broke into a sudden weeping and did hold my hand very dear against her breast and when i waked for the fifth time i to know how things did be about me and that i did lie naked in the cloak and did be all bandaged about my body and the bandages as i did know afterward did be from the torn garments of the maid and i look at the maid and knew that she did be drest again and did be in the garments that i did give to her as you to mind which did be that one and the inner that the humpt man tore from her and which she had slipt that she escape from the man and afterward i found that she had made a very cunning mend of the garments whilst that she did sit so utter long beside me to tend me for she had gotten threads from her torn garments and had made needles from thorns that did grow on the little bushes of the island and the thorns did brake oft and she then to have another and so to persist an hundred times and this way she did be drest very nice and dainty and mine own maid perceived how that i lookt with interest at her and did mind very natural how that i last to have seen her and she then to blush gently and did kiss me that she have her pretty face something from mine eyes and truly i to wish the more that i be strong that i kneel in a glad reverence unto her for this way did be my love and ever so and you likewise that have truly loved now i did begin that i grew very steady unto my strength again and mine own maid did tend me alway and she gave me a broth of tablets and the water at set times by the telling of my timepiece and oft she washt me and did change the bandages and did wash and dry the bandages that she use them over again for we did be so lacking for such matters as you to know and on the fifth day i was come utter to ease and did be wondrous happy and mine own to make pretty talk unto me but had me to be alway quiet because that i did be yet so weak and on the sixth day i to be let answer mine own and to say how great i did love her the which mine eyes had said alway while that i did lie in silence and i to be assured by the maid that she did be in health and recovered but indeed i saw that she was gone very thin and that her eyes did be weary even while that they had so great a love and a gladness to me and i made mine own to bring her tablets by me as she did alway and when that i had kist them and she to have eat and drunk i bade her to make me the broth ready and when she had made the broth i askt that the diskos be set anigh to me and afterward i bid her to my side and had her to lie by me and i took her pretty head upon mine arm and told her that she to lie thus and to sleep and to have no fear that she weary me for that i to be but the more rested to have her so beside me and she in the first to trouble that she be too heavy for mine arm but truly i showed that my strength was something come back to me for i prest her gentle unto me and she then to nestle content and to be gone into an utter sleep and to have been in a sore need of the same and mine own did sleep for twelve great hours and had scarce any life in all that time save when once she did make a little and gentle moaning and did afterward set her pretty face more nigh to me in her sleep and surely i had neither weariness nor lonesomeness but did lie with an utter content and did look downward upon the maid where she did sleep in the hollow of mine arm and truly she did be most wondrous lovely and dainty and the goodness of her face did seem as that it made an holiness about my heart so that my spirit was uplift in a quiet and constant glory of love and i drank a part of the broth at the third hour and at the sixth hour and at the ninth hour when that i finished it and my right arm did be free to this purpose and to the diskos and surely i did twice and thrice set my hand upon that great weapon as to a true comrade and in verity i could think the weapon did know and did love me and this thinking to be because i did be so uplift as i have told yet truly the diskos did be a strange and wondrous thing and did be alway thought to have an oneness with the man that did use it and in the twelfth hour the maid awoke sudden and came upward out of mine arm all in a sweet haste that she know that i did be well and she did be eased wondrous when that she saw how i laughed with a quiet joy but to see her dear eyes and her pretty trouble yet did she be in reproach to herself when that she lookt to find how the hours had past but indeed i did make a mocking sternness with her and forbad that she even to say one little word more upon this matter but to be glad that i did be so utter happy and she likewise and truly when i had said this that impudent maid did set her little fist against my nose and to threaten me and in verity i laught so hearty that the maid did be in fear i should set my wounds again to bleed and did reproach herself again but in truth i came to no harm and when that i could speak i askt the maid whether that there had been brothers to her because that she did play so natural and this i askt not thinking and lo in a moment i perceived my thoughtlessness but said naught save to take the hand of mine own that she know utter that i did not be heartless and she to nod very quiet and afterward kist my hand and slipt from me and i knew that she was gone a little way off lest she weep and i did be in trouble for her and for mine a lackness but truly i could do naught only that i called very gentle unto her and she to return soon and did smile loving and cheerful upon me but indeed i saw that she covered her weeping whilst that she had made me new broth yet before i would take the broth i would have her to mine arms and she to submit very glad and happy but to keep her pretty weight from me lest she hurt my woundings and afterward we both to eat and be happy in glad talk and presently i did sleep but would have her to be nigh to me even though she did be wakeful and so we to be utter content together now the seventh day as it might be called was a wondrous happy time and when i waked the maid did be sleeping as a child to my side and her face nestled against me and she to waken in a moment for thus had she drowsed and watched through all the hours whilst that i had slept and we then to eat and to drink together after that mine own had made me easy with a gentle washing and care and i now to be allowed that i have my tablets whole and the water afterward as when that i did be well and this to please me as you shall think for i did ache that i be strong very speedy that i have power to guard mine own maid again and to go forward with our journeying that i have the maid unto the safeness of the mighty pyramid and surely now that i had my tablets whole i to feel that i did grow near unto fitness again and moreover they did satisfy my hunger the better than the broth and the maid to give me my tablets oft so that i eat a great many and i did make her to count and surely there did be sufficient if that i get strong pretty quick and so i made no refusing of the tablets for i did need them that i make blood again within me else should i be lacking when that there came any need anigh and we kist each the tablets of the other and did drink from the same cup and did be utter happy and did be part like children but also to be man and maid and presently the maid did shift my bandages as alway and washt me proper and had me into comfort but she did keep me alway very low lying and truly i scarce to mind for i was not gotten enough of my strength to give me to feel irked and further as you shall think there did be that lovely one with me alway and did make sweet quips unto me and talkt and did laugh and oft did come into singing for she did be so sweetly joyed that i was in life and did mend so proper and afterward she went off from me a little to her toilet but i to ask that she be so swift as might be and she to promise very merry and she came back in a little while and her hair to be in a lovely cloud about her shoulders and her pretty feet yet to be bared from her bath which she had in a pool beyond some bushes and she to say that i did be so impatient a man that she to be forced that she do the half of her dressing with me but truly she came thiswise only because she to know how i did delight in her thus and to watch the way that she set up her abundance of hair and she to be hungry also that she be with me and to love me that i watch her even while that there did be oft a little and quaint stirring of shyness in her dear heart and i had her to come beside me and to sit anigh to my hand and i made presently that i did scold her because that she had no proper care to her pretty feet and i bid her to set her feet toward me that i look the more close at them and she to be a pretty rogue and did think i to mean to kiss them and truly not to think alway wrong but i then to have another planning for i had pluckt a hair very sly from her head and she but to have said an oh to me and to have thought no more but indeed when that she gave her feet to me i held them so strong as i might and i bound her pretty toes together with the hair and surely she did be a captive unto me and we to laugh as that we to be both children and afterward she stole back her feet from me but in verity i knew that she had a wondrous heed that she brake not the hair that bound her but did sit beside me bound in that pretty way but yet to hide from me that she did not brake the hair and she then to do her hair upon her head very lovely and afterward i put up my hands and took it down again and she then to kiss me and to ask how that she should ever have it proper upon her head if that i did alway so tease her and she then to take her hair and did set the abundance of it upon both sides of my face and then to kiss me as i did look up at her from out of so much beauty and afterward she cut a lock of my hair and a lock from her own dear head and she did plait the two locks together so that our hair did blend and be together and afterward she hid it in her bosom but i did be then out of content and would have done likewise only that it did so weary me to uphold my hands and she to cut a second lock from my head and a second tress of her own most lovely hair and she made me to kiss the hair that did be from her and she then to kiss the hair that did be from me and afterward she did plait them together and gave them to me and i set the hair for that time under the great bandage that went over my heart and truly she did be then the one that lackt content for she to say that the second plaiting did be kist and the first to lack but i to refuse to exchange so that we made up a quarrelling and did presently have to be kist unto forgiveness and truly have you not likewise known such glad foolishness when that you were in the love days and she then to make me to be quiet and to keep my hands downward from her hair because that the uplifting did prove overmuch to me and she took my great hands then and did threaten how dreadful she use me if that i be not humble and truly i said that i did be an humble man and she then to hold my hands with but one small one and surely her hand did be so small that she not able to hold me save by the thumbs and she then with her free hand to cover mine eyes so that i might not see and whilst that she did hold me thus so utter helpless she to kiss me very dainty and impudent upon the mouth and afterward she loost me and did be demure and we did be then silent a space and presently i put forth my hand that did be very great yet to be gone white and to tremble because that i did lack so utter of blood and the maid to know what i did mean and she clenched her hands into two fists and set them both into my one hand and surely they did be little fists and i then to be happy for this did be a wondrous pleasure alway unto me and she to have her lids a little downward upon her eyes and to be quietly happy and truly how i mind it all so plain and afterward i did plague her very gentle that she to be all a lack if that she did try to use her hands to aught because that they did be so small and she in a moment to have her two arms very dear about my neck and did kiss me with an utter love and tenderness upon the mouth and afterward went from me lest that she have me to overset myself and i did then to make her to sit by me and i did tell her a tale how that a young man did once live in the olden days and did meet with the one maid upon all the earth and how that they loved and did be married and she to die and of the utter and desperate madness of grief that nigh destroyed the man and how that he sudden to wake into the future of the world in a new time and did come to learn that his own did also to live in that time and he then to make that he find her and did truly come unto her and how she did be different in her beauty but yet to be utter lovely and the man did hold an utter reverence to the maid that had been his wife in the olden dream days so that his reverence of love did live in him like a constant pain and anguish of sweetness and trouble and of holy thoughts that did be bred of her lovely companionship and of his memories but in truth i gat not further in the tale than this for mine own did have come sudden into weeping and had gotten to her knees and did hold my hand against her breast and did put her hand gentle upon my lips and in a moment she to whisper somewhat through her tears and there to be dear motherhood within her face and a sudden shining of memory in her eyes that had been near dreadful only that it did seem to be to her as that she were part dreaming and the strange and solemn pain did come also unto me through the part open gateways of my memory and i to remember very clear and with an anguish in that moment and i told mine own how that the babe had gone onward after that the beloved had died and there did be then an utter quiet upon us and lo sudden the maid did bend unto me and i to take her into mine arms out of the vague dreamings of her memory dreams but ere she did be come outward entire from the haze of the past she to try to set somewhat into words concerning this memory vision of the babe but someways to be strangely dumb and i did be silent likewise because of all those things that did be between us forever and forever and presently she kist me and was herself again and she went from me to attend unto our food now that did be truly a lovely day for i to have gat sufficient of strength that i did be able to have interest and talk with mine own maid and she now to be well rest and to have ease in her dear heart concerning me and surely we oft to laugh and did make jests utter glad and foolish and indeed i do mind how that i askt mine own an olden puzzle that did come out of the vagueness of my memory dreams and she to be like a person that doth hear a strange familiar thing and lo sudden she to say as that she gat knowledge from beyond eternity that it did be when that he was a little hoarse and you to know the jest and to have troubled it oft at school but in verity it did be a strange thing to have from our memories out of all the deep of time and we in truth never in that age to have seen or to have known that ever there did be an horse or to mind the likeness of one and this to be but a little matter yet of strange and peculiar interest as you to agree and indeed we did both to look one at the other when that we had ended and did wonder what an horse did be yet in the same time did have a vague inward knowing and so we to look ever backward through dim ages and surely we gat presently from jests unto solemnness and the maid to be nigh again unto tears and in truth i then to bring our thoughts and our speech forward from the abyss of the years and did cease from memory dreaming for that time and so to have the maid again in joy yet mayhap something wistful odd whiles and presently i to tell the maid an hundred thousand things concerning the mighty pyramid of which i had so oft said somewhat but never to have gat so great a chance as this unto a plenty of time and so nice an oneness in the way that our minds did go and surely the maid did be eager in a moment and did be husht and again to ask constant concerning all matters and in verity there went a great while this way and the maid to have an utter wonder and excitement of all that i to tell for truly it did be as that a man of this age should come downward from a great star in the heavens and to tell of wonders and new things and you to understand how she did feel and of all things that did most have a happiness unto the maid i to perceive that the great life and humanness of the millions to dwell within her imaginings as a cloud of warmth and quiet joy for i did show this thing to her so well as i was able and in truth you shall tell me in honesty whether that i have made the same likewise clear seen unto you and she as you shall mind did be a maid that had grown all her life in a refuge that did be shaken with hauntings because that it lackt the power of the earth current to protect and with a people that did be weak conceived through great thousands of years and where love did bloom something faded even in youth and youth to have lack of the life blood of an utter joy such as did be ours and likewise to many that did be of the mighty pyramid though truly there did go millions then as now that did never to know love though the name did be in their mouths and they to have belief that the sweet kernel did be in their hearts but in verity this to be love that your life shall bound in you with abundance and joy dwell round you and your spirit to live in a natural holiness with the beloved and your bodies to be a sweet and natural delight that shall never be lost of a lovely mystery that doth hold a perfect peace each unto the need of the other and all to be that there go round about you a wonder and a splendour all the days and the nights that you shall be the man with the woman the woman with the man and shame to be unborn and all things to go natural and wholesome out of an utter greatness of understanding and the man to be an hero and a child before the woman and the woman to be an holy light of the spirit and an utter companion and in the same time a glad possession unto the man and lo if one to die then the soul of the other shall fail and that one never to have full life again in that bitter parting and this doth be the true human love and all else that be not like to this with the man and with the woman doth be but a borrowing of the name of love for that quiet desiring which is but an endurance beside love which doth be between they that be not mated both in their souls and in their bodies and this telling to take no heed to those base joinings that be made for purposes of wealth or desire or other piteous ends for in verity these to have no more dealings with the thing that i do tell upon than hath the merchanting of goods or the need of a glutton but the thing that i do have upon my heart doth be that dear and uplifting power of love which i to set forth in this mine own story for in truth i to have known love and to need death when that i be parted from mine own now surely mine own did come twice and thrice unto weeping as i did tell of this thing and that which did set her memory backward unto the ways of the lesser redoubt and presently i did cease from my tellings because that she did so be gone into pain of her memories but indeed she then to beg me that i go forward again for truly she to need in the heart that she know and to strive to be no more in grief for the telling and i then to say on and did tell upon the might and wonder and great olden delight of the underground fields that were below the great redoubt as you do know and i told how that they went downward an hundred strange miles that did be dug of the labour of millions and of the years of eternity and i set out unto mine own concerning that there did be wondrous villages spread through that great and hidden country that did be in the underground and how that great millions of the peoples did live there and made a constant labour in those deep lands and countries that did be truly so monstrous in all as an huge continent and i showed mine own how that there did be wondrous processes that did be learned in the ages and how that water did be made in chemistry and truly she to nod to this because that she did mind upon the powder that we did use but truly the powder to have to be made in the first as you shall think and we but to advantage ourselves of that which did result and i to speak to her of the making of the powder rather than of the way that it afterward to make chemistry with the air unto water and i told the maid how that there did be mighty underground pipes that went across the night land and did be mayhap oft so much as twenty great miles deep in the world and did come upward into the seas of the land and all to have been made secret and hid from the monsters of the land as i to know from much readings of the histories and mine own then to tell me that they did lack to have any such great wonders below the lesser redoubt but that there did be utter monstrous caverns where that there had been alway a strange and uncouth country of husbandry and lit from the earth current and they also there to bury their dead and all had been a lack through great thousands of years as she did know of their records and had grown dim lit and lonesome and a land of deepness to starve the spirit with an utter strangeness and discomfort where that the men went quietly as ghosts through many ages and all a place in dire want of sound and laughter yet this all to have been surely different a monstrous age gone when that the earth current did be a power in the lesser redoubt and the humans to be in plenty and of good and natural health and courage of life and truly to mind upon that place doth alway to set a fresh wonder in me that mine own did be so lovely and wholesome of spirit and wise and in knowledge and good force of her being but so it did be with her and she to have been surely alway that one that did be mine own and i then to tell mine own maid concerning the lowest field which did be the country of silence and was the place of memory unto all the great millions where did linger and bide the ghosts of an hundred billion griefs and the drifted thoughts of sorrowful hearts and there to live a great hallowedness and a mystery of silence and an holiness and a greatness as that it did be the expressing of all that doth be noble and everlasting that ever did come out of the heart of man and all the lost dead of eternity so that the spirit of a man did seem to go on great wings unto lovely and splendid resolvings if that he but to walk lonely awhile in that country that surely did be never lonesome unto the spirit and lo the maid did be all husht as i did speak and did look downward unto me with her eyes very bright and lovely with the thinkings and tears that did stir within her and sudden she to ask whether that i did make my resolve to my journey whilst that i walkt in that place and she to look very intent and beautiful upon me as she did question and indeed i saw that she to mean a lovely praise unto me as you to perceive and truly i did feel a little strange as that i did be both glad and shy in the same moment and she then to ease me of any answer for she gat upward upon her knees and she put her two hands to the sides of my face and bid me to look into her eyes and to know that she loved me with her soul and with all that did make her to be and afterward she kist me very gentle upon the forehead and did be then husht awhile as that she to be in thought yet oft she did look downward at me and did have a beauty of love and honour within her eyes so that they alway to shine as she did look at me and presently the maid did sit again beside me and slipt her two hands into the one of mine as did be ever my desire and she to love that she give me this delight and likewise she to have joy to herself in this lovingness and we then again to have talk and i did tell mine own somewhat of the history of the olden world and she did have dim memories as in dreams of the days of light yet scarce that she could believe it of truth but she to have knowledge of the olden love days within her spirit and to mind that there did be alway as it did be a lovely and golden light upon the world but she not to know truly whether this to be but the holy glamour light that memory doth set about a past loveliness and to have no remembering of the sun but yet to be made ready by her memories unto believing and i to know of certainty but yet even i that do tell this my tale did but perceive the days of the light as in a far and vague dream and to remember it but in the chief by the glory of lost sunsets that had cast an holiness upon my heart and of the hush of dawns that had made ready my spirit in the gone ages to look quietly unto my death and surely you to go with me in all this thing and to have felt within your own spirit that uplifted wonder that doth shake the soul with the lost beginning and with the unknown end when that you have lookt through the sorrow of the sunset and stood silent before the quiet voice that doth make promise in the dawn but in verity we that had near lost our memory of the surety of these great wonders did have memory of love and this to be most beautiful unto my heart for it but to show the more how that love doth live forever and doth make an holiness in all places and doth give companionship and satisfying so that to have love is to have all and to have escaped this wonder is to have missed to have lived and i to find then that mine own did have no knowledge of the way that the world did be in that future age and did lack to know that there abode mightily above us in the everlasting night the dead starkness of the world where did be mayhap two hundred great miles above us snow and the eternal desolation of a lost world that did be once the lovely world of the olden days which did be now given over unto night and silence and mayhap there did wander upward there memory and did go companioned by grief but indeed i to delight to think that hope and love did build houses of joy about the dead and there to be no true death but only the dying of days yet surely this doth be sorrow enough unto the heart and the soul if that they did be days when love did make a mystery of light about the spirit and the beloved to have been anigh to make ever a sweet wonder unto the heart but i to cease from these thoughts for we to face our life brave and wise and to take both the sorrow and the joy unto our developing and to hold up the face with courage when that grief doth come anigh and to see that we grow not to bitterness but unto sweet wholesomeness and there to be joy again and we then the better abled to have that delight into our hearts for how shall joy ever to come truly again to that heart which bitterness hath made a place for the abode of sorrow and truly i to cease from these thinkings also for my story to wait upon me and these things that i do say do be plain unto you and to have no need to the telling and so did i tell mine own maid of the things that i did learn from the little metal book and she to be in a constant wonder and delight and with an awe and newness upon her and sudden there did some olden memory stir within her for she askt me in one instant whether that i did remember when that the cities did move alway unto the westward but truly i had no remembering of this thing and did look at her awhile with somewhat of a trouble upon me for that there should be aught lacking in my memory of those times that we did be together upon this world was a fear unto me and a vague sorrow alway if that i did but to let my thought go that way though indeed i did ever strive to wiseness and did have knowledge that there doth be an heart wearing and despair and needless trouble in vain regrets but yet these to be natural unto the spirit if that you to know love and do be but the complement of the love joy and mayhap to have a use unto the sweetening of the spirit if that they be not let to over ride the reason and whilst that i did look unto mine own that she help me to remember she did strive with her memory but in the end did fail to come unto aught of clearness save that she did see as in a far dream yet very plain a great metal roadway set in two lines that went forever unto the setting sun and she then sudden to say that she did see in her memory the sun and she to have a strange and troubled amazement upon her and there did be cities upon the great road and the houses did be strange seeming and did move forward eternally and at a constant speed and behind them the night did march forever and they to have an even pace with the sun that they live ever in the light and so to escape the night which pursued forever as she did tell and a dread and terrible chill that did live in the night and there did be cities far forward in the morning sunshine that did have gone before at speed and set the husbandry of the world and to be finished and gone forward again ere that certain of the latter cities did come to that place to the reaping and the night to come presently to that place but this not to be for some part of a year after that the crops were taken but how long this might be she not to remember and all this the maid did say to me as out of a strange dream and i to have set it down and to have made it so clear to you as she to have told it and surely it doth be plain then that she to speak of a time when that the day did be grown to a monstrous length because that the world did turn but slow and weary and it to be a sureness as you shall perceive that but to stand still in that age of which naani told was to be left presently in an utter night and chill that should last mayhap a great and weary year and in verity it doth seem that all humanity did travel forever in that strange age when that to stay was to die unprepared in the bitter night and to go forward was to be forever in the sun and truly this doth be so strange seeming to me as to you and much i questioned the maid and did have an hurt within my heart and a pain of jealousy and sadness to grow in me for surely she did speak of some life that she did live when that i did be elsewhere either in life or unknowing and in verity what man then should have taught mine own to love him and she then mayhap to have had no remembering of me and truly i questioned very desperate and the more so because that i was yet weak and lacking my strength to be composed but she neither to remember me nor any other man of that time and to have no memories save these bare things that she to have spoken out so strange and which did come sudden unto her out of all the deepness of the years and the lost sorrows and joys and wonders of that which doth make a world of humans and surely my questionings brought a distress upon mine own both because that she did be troubled by the way that my love did bring me to this strange anguish and because that she also to have pain and a sudden fear that there did be ever a time when she not to have known me or to have permitted the arms of another and she did then strive that she be both wise and strong and to give help unto me and to take reason unto her own easing and truly she to show how that she did be all unknowing of any love in that far backward time but it to be possible in reason that she to have gone to another in natural course the while that her heart did yearn alway in vague trouble unto her own that her spirit did mayhap never to have forgotten and truly this doth be the way of life and a bitter thing and a sorrow to joyous love to think upon yet i here to be set to the tellings of truth and to have heed to all that reason doth show to be but mine own did also have us both to remember that there did be equal right to think that she had died mine own maid in that life for that it did be not out of reason to think that she had been void hearted unto all men because that she had known in her spirit that she did once to meet her own and did be thereafter untuned unto all other men that ever did live and this all to be in a mist and we to go vainly and of her will she did think that no man did ever to have possessed her save i yet this to be mayhaps only the prompting of her love and she then to kiss me and to say that there did be no surety in aught but only that we did have been together before and have borne a love so great that it did live through eternity and we to be now together and maybe all else to be but dreams and truly i did have a fierce hope that this be so and the maid likewise so to hope yet to be less bitter with rebellion than i though in pain upon the thought for she did be so utter and dreadful glad and in happy thankfulness that we did be now come together again in the end and did mean that she conquer all that should be like to set a greyness upon our joy and to be steadfast unto this end and i afterward to be likewise in wisdom when that i was come the more to strength and to mind that i suffer vainly for that which did have no surety as i have shown and moreover i did have no power upon the past either to learn aught or to mend aught so that i did go the way of an human and did shake free from these broodings and strove unto forgetfulness which in truth doth be both a terror and a mercifulness as doth chance and i kist mine own maid with somewhat more of the years within my love and she to kiss me very sober and dear and to desire only for my happiness and to be utter mine own now we then to eat and to drink and the maid to see me unto comfort in all things and my bandages all right and she then to make that she have on her footgear and her hair to be bound but indeed i bid her that she to dare do this thing when that she to know how i did delight that her little feet be bare to mine eyes and her hair most lovely upon her shoulders and she to be very happy that i so to have an utter pleasure in her dear beauties and did sit beside me again and set her feet very sly where they did be anigh to my hand for she to know that she did be mine own and i to be her master and she to have joy that she to have to render her beauty unto me for she did be that true complement unto me that the heart of a man doth ache for eternally and so presently did end that lovely day of quiet speech and togetherness and the maid did prepare me for my slumber and she then to lie anigh to me and her head to rest gentle beside me so that her pretty face did be near unto my breast upon the right side and she to give me at the first a loving and sober kiss that did be somewise to set a guard upon her tenderness and afterward did sleep content and gentle as that she did be in the same moment a child and a woman and i also to come unto slumbering yet did know vaguely how that mine own did rise a little upon her elbow this time and that and look very loving into my face that she have assurance of my comfort and well being and once i did waken proper and lookt at her and she then to kiss me gentle upon mine eyelids and bid me to sleep and so did come herself unto her sweet slumber now when that i did come to my proper wakening i to hear the fizzing of the water and to know that the maid did be risen a good while and had made her toilets as i perceived in a moment when that she came unto me for her hair did be in a lovely cloud upon her shoulders all combed and made ready against my waking and she to have bathed as i supposed in some warm pool that did be among the bushes upon the island and she now to slip her foot gear that her feet be bare unto me as i did love and to stand a moment and her eyes to twinkle gently and i lookt at her with love and honour in mine eyes as you shall know and she to have dancing of sweet pleasure in her heart that i so to look upon her with holiness and with natural love and surely the last doth be unnatural if that it do lack the first but my love did burn upward out of my being so that the flame of my spirit did light the fires of my heart and my reason to add coals unto that fire that hath lived for ever and doth be as that it shall be never quenched and mine own in a moment did kneel beside me and truly someways in her deep intenseness unto me for our love did make all the world holy and she to be both uplifted and as that she must give all the humbleness of her heart unto the greatness of my love and this she to feel and her deep and utter love to make it as that she did be all a passion of humbleness unto me so that in her soul i did rise in that moment upon the wings of my love and to seem that i did be all the world and all time and all place and all that ever she did need unto her and she put out her arms to me and her eyes did shine with those tears that do never be shed and lo in a moment she did be upon my heart and we two to be husht together in content for our need did be in the other and truly where there do be two together with love there doth be neither lack nor need but eternal fulfilment and in verity this to be my hope for that which doth come afterward that all doth be leading unto so glad a joy as this and that all pain and grief and all that doth make the shaping of life doth be but a process by which we be eternally perfected from living unto living unto each fulfilment that doth be but the doorway unto greater fulfilment in the beloved and presently mine own maid did loose herself gentle from me and washt me and tended me and very husht and tender and something down ridded of her dear and lovely eyes and we then to eat and to drink together and joy so great and quiet did be upon us that it did be as that we had gone into an eternity of peace and an utter content and surely as the thought did stir in me it did be of beauty that we did be both of us true unto the other in that life and i never to have kist a maid until that i kist mine own and she to have been likewise and to have fended all men from her because that they did be strangers unto her inwardness and so we two to be so utter together both in that our spirits did be knit being each the complement of the other and because that we had no secret pains of remembered things to set any apartness between our hearts and in verity i to think back then upon my jealousies that i have told and to know that mine own did never to have given herself lightly to any neither to have taken lightly and her spirit to have been alway mine through all the everlasting and mayhap this to be how all peoples shall come to be in the length of time only that to us had come the great wonder that we did early meet though this also to bring that utter pain which doth seem to slay when that once you have known the beloved and to be parted and so i to think and did presently ponder with a great and strange pity upon they that did not yet have met the beloved and they mayhap not to have kept all for the beloved but to have been light with that which doth be the treasure because that love had not come to show them that they did unknowingly squander the strange and holy glory which doth be the possession of they that shall come to the beloved and say all that is thine have i kept for thee and the beloved to know and to have peace in the remembering but what doth be the peculiar sorrow of they that have gone over lightly when that they shall meet the beloved for then shall there be a constant and inward regret as a thorn in the heart that they not to have observed alway that holy care of all which doth pertain unto love and they nigh to moan in the spirit if they had but known if they had but known yet in the end of their pain shall they grow unto all loveliness if that now they have truly come upon love and to live with love for this to be the especial glory of love that it doth make unto all sweetness and greatness and doth be a fire burning all littleness so that did all in this world to have met the beloved then did wantonness be dead and there to grow gladness and charity dancing in the years and there to be yet one thing upon which mayhap i not to have thought sufficient for it doth be this that they who did err as i have shown shall be the greater for their pain and let this be to cheer you if that you have done foolishly and thought not upon that day when the beloved shall come for pain is but the voice of development or destruction and truly you to suffer the first if that love doth work in you but truly the more that you have lacked the greater shall be your pain for the more change there doth need be in you and so would i have you now to think and to know that the beloved shall come and so shall you live in glad care of all your being that you be able to come unto the beloved in that day and to say with beauty and human joy in your heart even as i have said and thus shall you miss that bitter pain but yet truly you to be like to heed not this until that love doth come upon you and i therefore to cease from this vain setting of mine inward reasonings but truly when that day be come as i have told you to know how that there went alway with me in this mine own story which i tell the simplicity of truth and how that i did be minded only that you to know and thereby that you have gentle wisdom that you lay not up pain for that day yet if you do lack to go with me you to need that developing which shall then come upon you and so shall you perceive how my thoughts did go to and fro as i did eat with mine own and so in the last i to find that i did think very serious and i then to cast from me this pondering and to have that utter joy which did be upon us and to seem that it did fill all that strange country of seas and lo after we did be done of eating and drinking which did be but a little time as you shall think the maid did ease me to an upward sitting and had my back very nice to an olden stump which did be light and she to push unto me and mine own did sit then beside me so that mine arm did come most natural about her and she there to be nestled all gleeful and content so that my heart did be doubly tender unto her and i took the abundance of her hair and set it about my neck and upon my breast so that it did near to cover me in the upward part and we both then to laugh as that we did be two children because that love did make us so utter young in the heart and our hands to be hid under the beauty of the maid's hair and i to have her then that she explain just how great she did love me and you that go with me do know how that this doth be a delight that is never done neither to be set only into words and all that day we did be wondrous happy save once when we saw that there were humpt men upon the shore about the flat topt rock where did be the fight but what they did there we not to be able to see only that presently they went away and indeed seemed to have no thought unto us neither any knowledge and so did be gone again into the forests and we saw no more of them after that time and afterward we to be lost utter in happiness now upon the tenth day i did be so come into health that i to walk a little way to and fore upon the island and mine own did go with me and so i to pace a good while and afterward to rest again and mine own then to bring mine armour to me which she had scoured very nice but truly the armour did be sore broke and bent and did be jagged inward this place and that with the monstrous strength of the humpt men when that they did strike me with the great sharp stones and in verity how i should ever come again to wear this protection i to be in doubt yet truly it had been a wondrous suit of strength that had kept my life within me when that i had been so deadly beset and i to know that it to be yet like to save both our lives if that we could someway straighten it and ease the broken jags from wounding me afresh and i thought a time and the maid with me and afterward we gat that stump upon which i had leant and had this to be for an anvil and we found then smooth stones of different sizes and these to be for hammers and we wrought all that day with restings upon the armour and surely we beat it into a very good shape from the inward and the broken parts we beat smooth so that they should not wound and in the end to have mine armour fit to go upon me and i by now as you shall think to be drest part in my garments but not all for there did be yet some of the bandages upon my body so that for the main i did wear the cloak that the bandages be easily come at and all that day did be utter happy whilst that we workt for we to be together and on the morrow as we do say which was the eleventh wakening upon the island the maid and i to talk long and oft whilst that we yet worked upon the armour and we to ponder the best way that we continue to our journeying for indeed i was not come to my strength yet was i very earnest that we go forward early but in the same time i did fear lest that we meet with aught of danger and i to be a lack because that i was yet weak and presently the maid and i both to think upon the same thing for she to cry out concerning the raft and i to have the same word in my mouth and in verity this to be a great thought for then should we be able alway to be free of the humpt men and to have frequent rest when that we be weary and to sleep with an ease in the mind and indeed i to hope that the labour of oars should be something less than to go upon the feet and surely we talkt upon this a good while and afterward we left the armour and went over to the raft and so to learn whether we should have power to make it something more stable and that we have some way that we should put a solid matter between our bodies and any monster that should chance to swim under us and we went then together over all the little island for i did search for some bush that should have a long tendril in plenty and supple and so to suit for binding but truly there did be no such bush in all the island and this to put me in trouble as you shall suppose yet was there a sufficient plenty of small and upright trees that did seem very good for any purpose of structure and when we had gone all about the island and found naught that should bind the maid to say with a pretty jesting that we should cut her hair and plait it to be for cords and surely even as the words did come from her they to set me upon the thing that should supply our need for i stoopt sudden to the grass that did grow oft and plenty in this place and that and was so tall as my thigh and to my head in the middle of the dumpings where it did sprout and lo it was wondrous tough and the maid to have likewise perceived the thought almost at that moment but i to have been the first this time and so to tease her for truly we had grown that we did nigh alway to discover all things in the same instant as you mayhap to have seen but i did surely be first this time and must kiss her as we do kiss little ones that they be eased in their dismays and disappointments and she to see how i did mock her and she to pretend to weep and surely how could she even to pretend when that she did not be able to keep her pretty mouth from searching with laughter unto mine but must be kissed full and plenty in our constant joyfulness and we cut then a good arm load of the grasses using the knife and had those to our camp for we did be homely now unto that place as you shall think and the maid then to show me plaiting and how that we could work in the grass piece by piece so that we should plait unto any length that we to need and all that day we workt and did be very happy together but when that we came to the time of our slumber the maid had done twice and thrice so much as i and surely she came over to me and kist me very grave that i should be not to fret even as i did kiss her with gentle mocking concerning the thought about the grass and so did she make level with me by this impudence and quaint sweetness and on the next day which did be the twelfth i took the diskos and on that day i cut down six of the trees and alway the maid did bring her plaiting that she be near me and when i had cut the six trees she had me to cease lest that i risk to open any wound and truly they to have healed very wonderful and afterward we to plait all that day and did also finish the armour and did be content and utter happy and on the thirteenth day i counted the tablets and found that we yet to have sufficient if that we came unto the mighty pyramid within any reasonable time but i insist that i should eat no more now than did be my usual way and though mine own did beg and to coax me and even to try whether that a naughty and loving anger should do aught to shift me i not to alter from my deciding which was based upon my reason and upon my intention that mine own should never to go in hunger danger whilst that there did be life in my body and when that the maid did show this dear and pretty anger i to take her into mine arms and to tell her how i did reverence and love her and that she did be all beauty unto me and i but to love her the more because that i did know the reason for her dear shaping of anger unto me and she then to kiss me and yet to beg again that she have her way in this thing but presently i did show her that my reasoning was sound in this matter though i said not that my strongest thought did be unto her own needs and she to have to agree with me in her brain even whilst that her heart did ache to feed me and truly i to love her but the more as you shall think and this way shall you ever to manage a dear and sensible woman that doth both love you and hath reason in her for the wise man and he that hath an heart unto bigness doth be never hasty to command but indeed i speak not now of the way that you shall go with a woman that hath the love foolishness upon her for this to be a different matter as you do know and a woman then to require a double wit and tenderness in the governing but also to need to be commanded mayhap with sternness yet with the more love now when that we wakened on our fourteenth day upon the island we gat to work so soon as we had washt and eat and drunk and mine own to see how my scars did go and i cut seven more trees that day which made thirteen in all and afterward i trimmed the trees very nice and when this was done i cut twelve good sapling trees and two more very thin that i did mean to be for paddling the raft upon the water and mine own maid did sit near me alway and never to be ceased from her plaiting and whilst that the maid did plait and make gentle and happy talk with me i presently to sit beside her and had her belt knife to my need and therewith when i had cut bark from a tree i made a foot long cross piece of wood which i did fasten with pegs and some lashing unto the end of one of the paddle shafts and i took then a piece of the bark so big mayhap as would cover my thigh and shaped broad one end and thence to a point and when i had made holes in the piece of bark i lasht the broad end to the crosspiece and the end that did be narrowed i lasht secure to the shaft and likewise made holes down the length of the bark and lasht it also thereby to the shaft and thiswise i had a pretty good paddle that did be about ten feet long in the clear shaft and the head to be somewise two feet more mayhap and when this was done i shaped the handle so small as might come into the grasp of the maid and did jest her very loving and gentle that she give me so great a work because that she have her hands so little and truly she presently to stop me of my mocking for she put her pretty hands upon my mouth and i then to have to mumble and to laugh and so she to go forward again with the plaiting and when i had made the one paddle i made also the other but something more rough and heavy and suited unto my strength and so did be very well pleased for they did be made more of my reason than of memory yet had i used somewhat of the kind upon the quiet lakes which did be in the country of silence and we then to join in the plaiting and thus with happy talk and our times of eating until that we did be come again to our slumber and on the fifteenth day when that we had gotten up and washt and eat and drank the maid did look unto my bandages and did consider that i be healed very good if but that i not to overstrain my body and we then to dance half in play and half in victory but gentle and afterward she to come with me that she give me aid that we get the trees unto the water and in six hours we rolled the trees down to the shore and did begin then that i lash the saplings across the trees and thiswise to hold them secure into a raft and the midmost tree i put something more forward than the next and so until that which did be the front was shaped somewise like to the bow of a ship and the saplings to hold the trees thiswise when that i had set the lashings about every sapling and every tree where the saplings did go across and all that day i worked pretty constant and steady until that mine own had me to cease awhile lest that i bend overmuch and so to put strain upon my scars and i to be reasonable but yet to go forward again with the work only that i did rest now this time and that and so did all to prosper and on the morrow which did be the sixteenth day upon the island i made an end of lashing the saplings across the raft and i set up also two rests for the paddles so that we might row if we stood upon the raft and afterward being ready we gat together our gear and set all upon the raft and i put the pole that the maid had used also upon the raft and loosed the straps from that first raft and had the straps for our requirement as heretofore and mine armour we made safe on the raft but the diskos i had to my hip as ever and so did we be ready to leave that little island of refuge where we had been so near to sorrow but yet had come utterly upon joy and surely mine own did take me by the arm and she to stand a little and to look with me unto that bed of soft herbage where she had laid me when that i did be so nigh unto death and she then to kiss me very sweet and loving and gentle and all a tremble with the tears and love that did stir in her and i to set mine arms about her in love and so we to turn and to put off then in the raft xv past the house of silence now it was in the tenth hour of that day that we put off in the raft and surely we found the paddles to go very easy and with somewhat of balance in the rests which i had set up as you do mind and the raft to go forward with not overmuch of labour so that we stood the maid to the fore paddle and i did be to the hinder one and we pusht very steady upon the paddles and had the raft presently to a speed something less than we should walk over the rough way of the land and about the twelfth hour we stopt and eat and drunk and went on again with our easy labouring and truly when that we gat set to the movement we scarce to wot that we did aught more than rock something fore and back upon our feet and so the hours to pass and we to have a constant gentle speech one with the other and the maid oft to look back unto me with love and to set her lips that she tempt me but yet to shake her head most dear when that i would leave my paddle that i go forward unto her and when that the eighteenth hour of that day was come we to draw inward our paddles and the maid set the cloak very nice to be our bed and afterward we eat and drank and so presently to our slumber and did have sleep very sound and happy all in a moment as it to seem and eight good hours after we did waken both of us together and lo we scarce to mind where we did be for a little moment but afterward to know and to perceive that we did be safe and naught to have come unto us in our sleep and surely we laught each in the face of the other for we did be so joyous to be wakened each unto the knowledge of the other and after that we had kist we washt somewhat in the water of the sea and so to our food and when we had eat and drunk we made again to the paddling and went forward thus along the coast very peaceful and content all that day now in all that voyaging did talk four good days of four and twenty hours each for we made no great haste or labour but went easy that i have time to gather my strength and naught to happen in all that time save that once we did see a great beast to come upward lumbersome out of the sea on to the shore and there did eat and browse upon the herbage in that part or so it did seem to us though truly we did be over far off to have surety and this beast not to put us into any horror but only to make us glad that we be afar off from it and by this saying i to mean that it did seem unto us a natural thing and nowise to have an odour of aught monstrous to trouble our spirits and this way did be all the creatures of that country and truly i do think the early world did be somewise like to it and this to seem to make true that olden saying that extreme things do meet as doth be over apparent for thus doth it be somewise to our knowings as you shall perceive by your reasonings upon olden days and by the showings of this mine own story for that deep world to have put forth natural creatures that did be even as might be those that did live in the beginning though i to make no point of this but only that it doth occur to my thought and all to seem that it did be bred of circumstance and condition yet this to have no saying whether that there to be a spiritual force something deeper than the circumstance for this to be outside of any surety but not offensive unto my reason but this thinking also neither to offend me that although much and mayhap all doth be modified and shapen diverse ways by the circumstance and the condition yet doth there be an inward force that doth be peculiar each unto each though mayhap to be mixt and made monstrous or diverse by foul or foolish breeding as you to have knowledge of in the bodies of those dread monsters that did be both man and beast yet also i here to say that maybe all diverse breeding not to be monstrous but this to be beside my point for i to be now set to tell as i have told that it not to offend me to suppose that there to be this inward force peculiar to each shaping of all bodies that do hold that wondrous quality of life and if that you ask me that i give example to make clear my thought i to say that it doth be reasonable to suppose that the force or spirit of the human doth be peculiar to the human whether that it to be a cause of life or the result of that which hath been evolved out of a condition and whether it to be the one way or the other you to know that where this force or spirit be found untainted there is man and i to be not opposed to think that man doth be constant alway in matters of fundament and neither to have been ever truly different though something modified in the body and surely in the first all undeveloped in the lovely things of the spirit because that there to be no call to these yet presently they likewise to come and to act upon the flesh with refinings and likewise mayhap there to be some act of the flesh upon the spirit and so to the state of this age of this our day and to that far age of which i do tell but development never to make the human other than the human for the development to have limits peculiar to the human and surely it doth appeal to me that the development of man doth lie between two points that be not wondrous wide apart and man to have power that he arrive very speedy from one unto the other and likewise that he go back so quick or even the more hasty yet even did it be ever proved that man once to be a fish i to have no cause to abate the first part of mine argument but to have the more need of the thought that i gain power to accept the fact for i still then to have no occasion that i think man to have been truly a fish or aught truly different from a man but only that he did be once modified physically to his need and to be still possessed of the man spirit though all lackt of development yet truly i to be less offend in my reason if that it be shown that man did be ever somewise in his present shape though mayhap so brutish as the humpt men but yet i do be ready to consider all matters and do build no walls about my reason yet neither i to have an over ready acceptance of aught but to need that my reason shall approve and you to perceive surely that i here not to speak of that which may be afterward when that all this our life be done for who shall say how much or how little we then to go forward unto loveliness and i at this point to tell you that i do have a wondrous hope of beauteous things and of sweet and mighty uplifting and furtherance unto that glad world which we have beheld the shores of when that we had stood in holiness with the beloved and in verity i now once more to my story and to be glad that i am done at this small setting forth of a matter which did need words because that it did have root in this mine own story and to be grown of it and from it now there did be one other thing of note beside the sea beast whilst that we did be upon the seas and this did be the strangeness of a great fire hill which did stand in the sea and we to pass very nigh unto it and surely the sea did boil about it yet not in all places and there did be a score great jets that did go upward a monstrous way and did roar very plain to us across the sea between and there did come strange gruntings from the sea about the base of the fire hill and these i to conceive to be made by the upbursting of gases in this place and that and surely it all to make us to know of the great energy that did be wakeful in that deep country and we yet to stare backward upon that hill of fire and force for a great while after that we had come past now beyond this there to be naught except that we had a certain care as we did come to that place where the great sea did be broke to smaller seas but all to be knit with passages of water which let us through upon our way and surely i did show mine own maid those two places where i did sleep when first i was come into that country and she to be sweet in interest and alway to have somewhat that she would learn of this and that and so when that we did be four good days upon the water as i have told we to come to the land upon a flat place of the shore where the country did slope upward unto the mouth of the first gorge of which you do mind and this to be in the tenth hour of that day and we likewise to have begun that voyage in the tenth hour as you do remember and surely it to have been a sweet and peaceful water journey and i to have been happy if that all that did be yet before us to hold so much of pleasantness and safe goings but indeed there to be much danger yet to come as you do know and we to have our hearts set in courage and to go forward to conquer for surely if that we to conquer and to come safe into our mighty home there to be then that we have all our lives together in loveliness and this to be truly a worthy prize and a glory of the heart to end and to repay our stress and surely the maid and i did presently strand the raft so well as we might and did then to wonder whether any should evermore to behold it through all eternity and we lookt a little each at the other and the maid then to cut free a small piece of the wood of the raft to be for an after remembrance and so we to have our gear upon the shore and the maid then to give me aid that i get once more into mine armour and so i presently to have the scrip and the pouch again to my back and the diskos in my hand and all in readiness and the maid with her bundle that was now grown small and her belt about her body that she have her knife unto her hand and surely the maid then to kneel and to kiss the raft for memories did gather upon her and she there to have one more breaking from all that did be the first part of her life and you to give your understanding and so to have a quiet sympathy and to perceive that her heart did be like that it should stir with a strange trouble of sorrowing in that moment and surely i stoopt then very gentle and loving and had mine own to her feet and i led her from the raft and she to need that she be near me and so we to go forward and to make upward unto the dark mouth of the great gorge and there to be some miles unto our right that grim and utter huge mountain whereon afar upward in the monstrousness of the night did be perched those four fire hills of which i have told and below them there to go upward the great hills of ash that had been cast down throughout eternity and this thing had the maid lookt upon for a great time and did be never done of her wonder neither i nor any human that ever should have sight of so great a wonder and so we to have come presently upward into the high mouth of the gorge and did go onward then into the gloom a little space until that we were come to the place where the gorge did bend sharp unto the left into darkness and lo we made pause here and turned again unto the country of seas that we have a last outward look over all that deep and living land that did be hid so far downward in the everlasting night of the world and in verity it did be a solemn thing to know that we mayhap to be the last of the olden humans that should ever to look upon that country and i to wonder in that moment whether that the humpt men should ever to develop in some far eternity unto the full sweetness of the spirit of humanity which i did think to be inward of them and this to be both an odd and a natural thought to have then as i do see but at that time i only to think it and not to wot or to trouble whether that it did be odd or otherwise and i to think that country did be somewise as the olden time renewed but truly we to look upon early things with new eyes and we yet to look awhile and to be husht and to hark in those last moments unto the far mutter of the great fire mountains and the fire hills and the noise of life which did go over that land and we even then to be but a few short pacings off from the silence of the great gorge which should lead us presently toward the eternal strangeness which did be in the night land and the maid did hold mine arm very close as we lookt our last into the red light of that deep and hid country of the world where in verity we had come so utter nigh to our death and presently i turned and the maid slipt her hand into mine and the tears did go silent down her face because of all that did be prest upon her heart but yet not to be all of sorrow for there to be both sorrow and happiness and also there did be somewhat of vague emotion that she never more to look upon that dear island where she had nurst her man again unto life and well being and she to be in mind of all those places where she to know that in after life her memory to wander and she to have oft told tales mayhap unto her children of that country that they never to see but only to be for a wonder to them for ever and we past then round the mighty corner place of the gorge and went forward somewhat stumbling into the gloom now we went sixteen hours very steady and with naught save the great darkness to trouble us and we by this to have been twenty and six hours since last that we had sleep and surely this did be a foolishness because that i to need that i come into my full strength ere we reach the night land and it to be a folly that i should over tire myself and the maid to have said so much and indeed then we came to a safe place for our slumber and whilst that we eat and drunk we made count from my notings of the outward way and so did decide that we go no more than sixteen hours' journey each day through the gorge and to sleep alway for eight good hours and this we to do both then and until that we did be come out of the great gorge which did take us in all so much as five days thiswise and surely when that we were come into the light places of the gorge we to be more cheered as you shall suppose yet oft did we be half smothered with the horrid gases that came upward in this part and that as you do mind and my strength did grow constant as we journeyed yet would the maid never suffer that i carry her but went alway very light and clever and was grown in truth set unto this constant wander and at this place and that i to make pause that i show mine own those places where i did slumber and she alway to need that she come unto the very part and that she stand for a little moment where i did lie so lonesome as i went outward unto that despairful searching and alway she then to be utter tender with me and to be something lacking of speech because of the calling of her heart and surely mine own did be alway now to ask me when that we should be come unto the night land and to require how far it should be and to be taken with a growing of excitement very dear and natural and in verity i to be almost so much so as she and to wonder what she to think of the mighty redoubt and of all that strange and monstrous land and above all these i to be shaken unto my very heart that i have the maid speedy unto safety lest after all even though we to have come so far there somewhat to happen of woe and all this did make it a hard thing that we not to begin to race and to exceed the hours that we did set but truly we had wisdom in this matter and slumbered alway after the sixteenth hour and we never to see aught of life in all that great and desolate gorge for there did be only the gas burnings and the boulders and the stark rocks and oft the rank smellings of the gases and alway an utter and everlasting quiet save when some lonesome gas fire did oddly to moan or to whistle and the whistling to sound very dree across the great waste of the gorge and likewise the moaning to be but a thing to make the loneliness to be felt in the heart and the maid to feel thus with me and alway as i did know she to think in her heart that i did come through that place alone to make a searching for her into the unknown lands of the world and surely i did be but a natural man if that i was something happy in my heart that mine own so to ponder and to remember for thereby did her love seem ever to grow and likewise a man doth be glad in his spirit and natural pride that his maid to know that he hath done wholesomely of his best for her need and you but to think upon the love days and to hear the echoes of those dear proud thoughts that did so to swell in you and doth not all to go so strangely with familiar pain in the old way now it was upon the fifth day in about the seventh hour that i heard oddwhiles a sound in this place and that of the gorge as that the rocks made husht and strange sounds at us and i to have the maid instant very nigh to me and the diskos to my hand and we then to go onward with a great caution and thrice we did pass places where gas fires did burn and dance and made oft a low moaning and somewhiles a little whistling and the other sounds yet to come oddly from the rocks in this place and that very strange and unthought of yet to be something familiar and sudden it did come to me that there to be a far away noise in these sounds though they to seem to come from this place and that almost to mine elbow as you should say and lo i knew then that i harked unto little echoings that did be caught by the near rocks and to come from some far and mighty sound and this should be surely the monstrous piping of the great gas fountain that you do well mind and in verity i told mine own in a moment and she to be all eager with me because that this did be both a wondrous thing and to be also a landmark to show that we did be nigh to come out of the gorge and our journey to come the more near unto an ending and surely we lookt ahead very earnest and there to be so many strange and leaping fires to our front that we not to be very sure which did be the far and monstrous dance of the great gas fountain for truly it to be yet so distant that the near gas fires did make more upon the eye up all of a weary length of the gorge than did the great dance of the far off fire that was now so small by the distance and presently when that we were gone onward something more we to see that there went a lightening and a darkening afar along the gorge so that the background of the night was made to lose somewhat of the intensity of its darkness as with constant shudders of light and this to be surely the far away dance of the flame of the great gas fountain and we then to watch alway as we journeyed and to see how that the vague shudderings of light did grow in the distance of the night and did merge and become known presently in a strange uplifting and falling of a far away blue flame and the sound now to come more steady and to grow in a long while into a monstrous piping very great and wonderful and having a constant change in the note and we to come past the last of the lesser fires and to be in that part of the gorge which did be fireless save for the great upward dance of the gas fountain which did now to be grown huge and plain seen and did make a quaking light over all the gorge and so in the end we to be come very nigh to the dance of the monstrous flame and did be half stunned by the noise which did be now an utter and furious roaring as you shall remember and the maid and i did stand as but two lonesome strangers in the mouth part of that deep and desolate gorge and did stare voiceless unto the great flaw and mine arm did be about the maid and she to stand very nigh to me and neither to speak and surely how should we anywise for the noise did be so huge and after that we had stared a great while we turned that we look each at the other and we kist very sober there in the light from the monster flame and afterward we did stare again at the flame and soon turned and lookt all ways and did marvel to see the great throw of the light go blue and spreading and strange unto great distances and a while we did be watching the way that the far off side of the gorge did come plain to sight when that the flame did leap and truly that did seem a far and lonesome place as that a lost and forgot world of desolate mountains did be there and lo we now to look that we should see somewhat of the way that our journey to go and surely naught to be clear shown save when the flame did rise oddwhiles to a monstrous height and this to be because of the huge rocks that did stand about the flame yet something i was abled to show the maid of the bottom part of the mighty and utter monster slope that did be the last way of our journey ere we were come to the night land and we then to go onward for about a good mile that we be not so deafened by the noise of the gas fountain and it did be now beyond the seventeenth hour so that we eat and drunk and made our rest in a secure place among the great boulders and lo when that we waked we eat and drunk again and did be something silent as we to gaze at the flame dancing monstrous and lonesome and all set about with the stark and mighty rocks which did be like unto giants of silence that did watch forever and presently we had our gear upon us and we went forward toward the utter dark of the mighty slope and we began that huge climb that should last through days in an eternity of night and oft in the first hours did we turn about from our blind stumblings and gaze downward out of the long height unto the loom of the flame that did shudder far below in the night and made a quaking light in that far darkness and so did we leave it to dance forever through eternity in that deep and lost place of the world and we bent all our will and our strength unto the climb and this way went we stumbling for sixteen great hours and by that time had come to a pace proper for that task and to be something numbed and seeming grown unreal because of the affecting of the darkness and lo for eight days then did we go upward forever through that most dreadful night and after the first day we crept alway upon our hands and our knees and i to go in the front and had the diskos ready upon my hip and i took two of the straps from the pouch and the scrip and so had a certain length and i set them from the waist belt of the maid unto mine own belt and so did know ever that she came close after me and we made journeys sixteen hours long and did eat and drink at the sixth and the twelfth hours and likewise we eat and drank ere we slept and again upon our wakings and our slumber time to go alway somewheres about eight good hours for thus did i be heedful that we have all our strength for that dreadness of the journey which did be yet before us across the fear and horrid terror of the night land and oft at this time and that i was utter sickened and a wearied of reaching forward and upward forever and making blind fumblings that i find a way about great boulders and the rocks and holes that did be in our path in the dark for it to seem that we went lost from all life and knowing in a blackness that should be never slackened from about us and i these times to make a pause and to call softly unto mine own that she creep up nigh unto me and i then to take her into mine arms out of the utter blackness of that night and so to give and to have comfort and surely mine own did whisper once unto me that she did be stunned with love and wonder in the heart for she to never cease to know that i did adventure through this great night that i find her and this thing did make me very warm in my heart as you shall think but yet i to stop her speech with a gentle kiss and she then to know that she be dumb concerning her thought in this matter yet she never to cease from remembering it and did be the more stirred with the trouble of her lovely secret worship for in verity she to have me to be for her hero and this to make me in the same moment both something shamed and greatly proud and so we to be together and after such pause to go forward again with a new courage and surely it did be a great comfort to me to think that because we to go upward and not downward we be not like to fall over any hid cliff in the night for i to have now some little knowing of the slope from mine outward journey yet to remember upon that monstrous pit that i then to escape and so to go with care and indeed upon the second day i had mine own to creep more nigh with me and i then to have but one strap between us and the other i set a stone into and did cast the stone alway before us as upon the outward way and you to mind you of this if you but to think a little minute and oft in those weary days in the darkness did i make gentle whisperings through the blackness unto mine own that i give cheer unto her and she alway to answer very sweet and loving yet ever husht as i did be and in verity it did be as that we could not set our voices loud upon that mighty slope lest some enchantment come upon us as it might be said and indeed each time that i cast the stone the noise of the stone to make a little trouble and dismalness in mine ears for all did be so quiet and desolate and lost in night that it to make us to need to be likewise so quiet and to desire that we might go upward so silent as shadows now surely i must tell here how that the maid to have alway at waking that same awaredness that i did have upon the outward way that somewhat did be nigh to us and to seem to have been concerned with our waking and i likewise to have also the same knowledge as before and oft as we did go i to feel that somewhat did go near to us and this to put something of a fear upon me because that i was ever anxious for mine own and i to have her to be alway the more nigh to me and did set the strap from her to me even when that she slept so that she not to be touched and i to lack to know yet she to have no fear concerning this thing but to feel in her spirit that it did be a force that had no evil intent unto us but more neither she nor i to know and i in truth to come in the end used to it save that i did be as i have told anxious in all that did concern the life and well being of my beloved and so did we go onward through those eight days and it soon to be grown cold so that we both to need the cloak over us in our slumbers but in the journey hours to need naught for the upward going did surely heat us very well and there also to be come presently a change and a seeming of thinness into the air and the maid to remark upon this and likewise that the water powder now to be that it not to fizz so plentiful and we went upward as it did seem forever and journeyed very husht and steadfast and likewise did halt at set times that we eat and drink and did alway sit then very close and quiet and in love and so alway to go never beyond sixteen hours' journey each day and very weariful even so much for it to be a sore and constant labour of climbing and i to learn the hour alway by a little shining of the diskos upon my time dial which i have told did be somewise as the watch of this our present age yet truly i also to learn that i made somewhat of a constant number of forward throws of the stone in an hour and the maid to be the first to discover this as she did creep behind me and harked steadfast and quiet unto the clatter of the stone each time that i cast it and she sometimes to call low to me that it now to be this time or that time and i to look at my dial as i have told and oft to find that she did be curiously right yet otherwhiles we to have no thought to count but made a constant husht talk one to the other and did grow odd times that it did seem to us that we did be two spirits there in an everlasting darkness that had quiet speech one to the other and to be seeming gone from our bodies and we then to need that we look each at the other that we know truly that we yet to live and to be indeed with the beloved and i then alway to make the diskos spin a little yet something more than when i should see the hour and in verity our faces then to show pale and strange seeming in that luminous glowing of the great weapon in the darkness and we to look very eager and an hungered of love each at the other and so to need that we be held loving by the beloved and so to have comfort and assuredness and afterward to have peace to go onward again and it did be one such time as these that mine own to give me a love name she had called me in those olden days of this age and which surely i had not heard since mirdath died and in verity you to have dear understanding with me how that i then to be all troubled with vague troubles and ghostly love aches in the heart and likewise i did be all set about in a moment by the olden enchantment and speechless glamour that did be so long hid and lost in the spaces of memory where surely the spirit doth wander such oddwhiles husht unto a dumb tearlessness and to know in the same moment both agony and the voiceless glory and lost delight of the hath been so that it doth be as that you wandered in the spirit between the sorrowful pain of the sunset and the promise of the dawn which doth be builded upon the need and hope of the soul and doth also to have an essence of pain within it because that these do be knit with longing which doth be the essential pang of memory and so mayhap you to have gone with me for you to have also strange thoughts that do come out of the years and do hurt the heart even whilst that the heart doth hunger of that which doth so pain yet truly mine own did be now with me as you do know so that i had joy all about my heart yet did all the years of my lost delights and of my pain be in the spaces of my memory and mine own now to have stirred all so that no words that did be ever shaped of man should help me to have ease in speech and mine own maid to know how it did be with me and she to have said the thing scarce wotting even as her spirit did set it through her lips and she before then to have forgot so utter as i and now she to be stirred likewise with me so that in verity we to hold hands in the great darkness upon the slope and to wait till the pain and strange trouble did go somewhat from our hearts and we to have power again to know truly that we did be again together in sweet verity after a mighty eternity and thus did we go and even in that strange night to have an everlasting coming together so that surely our two spirits to be nigh made one somewise and this to be that sweet and holy thing which i do name love and it to be my glory and astonishment that love hath come unto me and with you that have love i am as a brother in holy delight but with all that have not known love or to have missed love i am a mourner and my heart to pray that they to know this wonder ere they die for else shall they die so green and bitter as they be born and to have grown nowise unto ripeness which doth be charity the end of life and the crown of humanity and surely i to go forward again now with my telling and you to know that on the eighth day upon the slope about the end of the ninth hour there to be an upward seeming of light afar before us in the darkness and did show as a dull and vague sheen above us in the night and truly i to know that we did be come at last a near unto the night land and we went upward then very eager through the dark and the dim shine did grow ever so that we soon to see it very plain as a looming of light afar upward and we ever to climb and to go onward and lo in the fourteenth hour of that day we came up slowly out of the night upon the slope and stood at the ending of that strange road where the silent ones walk and surely it did be as that i was come home and to have set my feet again upon familiar lands and this to bring to you how far off i did seem to have gone and now to be come again to a known place and we went upward upon the road until that we did truly have topt the slope and at last to look out over all the wonder and mystery of that land and i never to be rid of the utter gladness of knowing that i was come there again after so strange a journey and that mine own had i brought with me out of all the unknown world yet truly i also never to have forgetting that this familiar land of strangeness did be the last test and the greatest dreadfulness of our journey and anxiousness did hang upon me for i now to have to take the preciousness of mine own among and beyond all that danger of horrid forces and of monstrous things and beast men and the like and truly i did be like to trouble and in verity i did stare with a fierce eagerness unto the far off place in the middle part of the night land where did be the mighty pyramid and surely it there to shine in the midst of the land and did be mine home where never had i dared hope i should return and i set mine arm very swift and eager about the maid and pointed so that she see quickly the wonder and safe mightiness of that which did be our refuge for all our life to come if but that we to win unto it and the maid to look with a great and earnest soberness and a lovely gladness and utter soul and heart interest unto that place that bare me and where i to have come from and now to take her and long and long she lookt and sudden came round unto me and set her arms quick about my neck and burst unto a strange and happy weeping and i to hold her gentle to me and let her cry very natural until that she was something unpent and lo when that she was eased she to stand close beside me and to look again unto the mighty pyramid and afterward as she to steady she to ask an hundred questions so utter eager and so to thrill with joy and excitement as that she did be a glad child and an hundred questions i answered and showed her new things and wonders uncounted and of all strangeness that she then to see there did none so to shake her in the spirit with terror as did that dreadful and horrid house which did be the house of silence and it was as that her very being did know and be repulsed of some horror that did concern and be in that house so that she to want to hide in the bushes that did be anigh to the road and truly i to think this wise and to remember and to be ware suddenly that we did be indeed come now into the power of monstrosity which did be utter and forever abroad in that land and surely we went then in among the bushes that did grow clumpt upon the side of the road as you to remember and afterward i calmed this new fear that had come so quick upon mine own and she then to peer forth with me from the bushes and to have renewed sight over the land and the house of silence to stand upon that low hill of which you do know and did not be a very great way off somewise toward the right yet as you shall have remembering it did take me some long and bitter hours upon mine outward way ere i did be come from under the shadow of it as we do say unto the top part of the mighty slope but this to have been in the main because of the utter care that i did need to bring me safe past the house for i to have gone long and weary upon my hands and knees among the bushes as you remember and oft to pause and to be so still as death lest that the power of the house to have become aware of my passing and truly we to need again so utter a care when that we make to go past unto our mighty home and this to be heavy upon my heart and i to be in the same moment anxious that we have haste to the trial and yet very willing if it might be that we not make it forever and indeed after that we had peered a good while from the bushes i to consider that we do well to eat now and afterward to have a safe place for our slumber so that we go fresh to the horrid dangers and dreadfulness that did be before us upon our way and we then to look about and soon to find a great boulder that did be set with the bushes and we made our place for sleep against the boulder and the bushes went all around so that we did be complete hid and in verity we to be very cold as we had been those two past days whilst that we made toward the top of the mighty slope and now we to have the full chill of the night land and did be very glad to have the cloak so that we eat and drank whilst that we sat together and the cloak round us and afterward the maid set the cloak about us for our sleep and we then to kiss very sober and i with anxiousness in the heart but she with less because she to have rest in me and so we lay down to our sleep and the diskos ready in my hand and my spirit wakeful against any terror that should come anigh to us in our slumber and the maid i warned to be likewise wary and surely we slept and waked and there had gone eight good hours and naught was come anigh to us to harm us and we eat and drank and did hark oft and lookt out from among the bushes but there did be naught abroad to set dread upon our spirits and so we did be more content and well rest and a ready for the further journeying now i had the maid to wear the cloak because of the chill of the land but she in the first to refuse save i also to have it in my turn but truly i did feel that it should smother me and that i need all my freedom of my body lest there come any thing sudden upon us and all this i showed mine own and also that we should have weary work and to creep much so that i should be warm by my labour of going and she likewise mayhap and she then to consent because she saw that i did be earnest and to burn with anxiousness yet had me to promise that i take the cloak if that the chill of the land gat me anywise bitter now we made a pause when that we have our gear upon us and we lookt well out over the land and surely alway our eyes did gaze in the ending upon that far wonder of light and safeness which did be the mighty pyramid and i to be never ceased from telling mine own this thing and that thing concerning the great refuge and she to be constant stunned unto silence and delight of wonder and anon shaken unto a multitude of questionings so that truly we did be as that we never to have done making known one unto the other now as you have knowledge the house of silence stood upon a low hill and the road did bend about the bottom of the hill and this way did i come when that i was on mine outward way yet now there to be a new plan of journeying come into my mind for as you do remember i did take somewise of eleven great days from the pyramid unto the top part of the mighty slope because that i had gone diversely and round about to the north west of the plain of blue fire and surely as now i lookt it did seem that we should try a short passage and thereby be come free out of all danger in but a space of four or five days if only we to succeed and i stood a good while very husht and anxious and did consider this new way and did presently point it out to the maid how that we saw the mighty redoubt straight to the back of the low hill where stood the house of silence and mayhap we might chance to find a safe going that way and that i did ponder thatwise for indeed as you do know we must go nigh past the house even did we return by the long journeying and this to be because that the bushes did make a cover only near to the road and all to be a country of bare rock beyond the bushes on that side of the road which did be to the north and west now presently i had formed my intention regarding our way and told all to mine own and how that we to have alway an utter caution and the danger i made so plain to her as i did know it and she then to beware in her heart the need there to be of care and wiseness forever as we did go and we then to make forward into the night land and to be gone from the top part of that great deep in which there to be hid strange lands as you do know and surely it to be like that none should ever to go that way again for an eternity or maybe forever and so went we forward with a new caution and we came out from among the bushes upon the north west of the road and crost unto the eastward side and here the bushes to grow very plentiful so that i led on with a cheerfulness of hope within my heart and alway i went so far to the south east as the bushes would give us their cover and this way i made that we should scarce to pass within a great mile of the dread and horrid house though in verity this to be most dreadful close and we walked then for six hours and went sometimes creeping and oft stoopt and ever with a great caution and in the sixth hour we made a rest and eat and drank and afterward went forward again and in the tenth hour were we come something nigh unto the house for truly we to be off from the road where the silent ones walk and so to go more straightly and alway to save distance and we kept so far outward from the house as we might but could pass it not more than a great mile off because that the bushes did have their margin near upon our left as we went and there to be barenness of rock beyond and fire holes in this part and that amid the starkness of the rocky spaces that should be like to show us very plain if that we came outward from the bushes and moreover there went upward into the everlasting night one of those towers of silence which did be in this part and that part of the land and were thought to hold strange watchers and the tower stood great and monstrous afar off in the midst of the naked rocks showing very grey and dim save when the flare of some great fire did beat upward in the land and sent huge and monstrous lights upon it and we to have need alway now to remember this tower and to keep the more so to the sheltered hiding of the bushes yet in verity we to have little thought of aught save of the grim and threatening terror and monstrousness which did stand forever upon that low hill and did be the house of silence and in the eleventh hour we did go creeping from bush unto bush and did be as shadows that went in the mixt greyness and odd shinings of that land and the grim and dreadful house did be now unto our right and did loom huge and utter silent above us in the night and the lights of the house did shine steadfast and deathless with a noiseless shining as that they shone out of the quiet of some drear and unnatural eternity and there did a seeming of unholiness to brood in the air and a sense of all and deathly knowledge so that surely our hiding did seem but a futile thing unto our spirits for it was to us as that we did be watched quiet and alway by a power as we slipt gentle from bush unto bush and when the twelfth hour did be nigh we to begin to draw clear of the house and surely there to come somewhat of ease into my brain and heart for it did be as that we should come clear of all harm and i turned to the maid that i whisper gentle and loving encouragement unto her and lo in that moment mine own gave out a sudden low sobbing and was gone still upon the earth and truly my heart did seem to die in me for i knew that there did be directed a force out of the house of silence which did be aimed unto the spirit of mine own maid and i caught the maid instant into mine arms and i set my body between her body and the dreadness of the house and surely my spirit to perceive that there beat out at her a dreadful force which did have in it an utter silence and a bleakness of desolation and lo i saw in a moment that the force had no power to slay me but did surely make to slay the maid and i set my spirit and my will about her for a shield if this might be and i had her to mine arms as that she did be mine own babe and i stood upright for there did be no more use to hide and i knew that i must walk forever until that i have mine own to the shelter of the mighty refuge or to walk until i die for only with speed might i save her from the dread and horrid malice of that force and i set free the diskos from my hip and had it in mine arms beside the maid and i strode forward out of the bushes and put forth my strength that i journey with an utter speed and ever my spirit did know of that monstrous force which did be direct upon us to the destruction of mine own maid and odd whiles as i walkt i called mine own by her olden love name and by the new name of naani but never did she move or seem even that she lived and surely my heart sickened within me with a mighty despair so that a constant madness did begin to thrill in me and to make me something monstrous in strength with my fierce agony and intentness to save and one hope only had i that i bring her yet living into the shelter of the mighty refuge and so swift to the care of the doctors and lo i did strive to be wise in my despair for i made a quick halting soon and i warmed a broth of the tablets and water upon a hot rock and strove that i set some of the broth between the closed lips of mine own maid yet did it be useless as i to have known before in my heart and alway i kept my body and my will and my spirit and my love between the maid and the dreadfulness of the house and i made some of the water and dasht it upon the face of mine own and i chafed her hands but truly it to have no use neither did i truly to think it should be like to and i wiped her face then and harked to her dear heart and surely it did beat very slow and husht and afterward i wrapt her in the cloak and i forced myself then that i eat some of the tablets and i drank a great lot of the water for a fever did seem to burn in me and moreover i to mean that i lack not for strength to my task and i set my gear upon me very speedy and i lifted mine own beloved that did be now so husht that once had been so merry and dearly naughty and surely i nigh choked as the thought uprase in me but i set it back and did but go the more furious and surely no man did ever go so fast and constant upon his feet through an eternity for i was come again to my strength and there did be a madness of intention and despair upon me and i went on forever and at each sixth hour when i stopt very brief to eat and to drink i made to bring mine own to her senses yet she never to come and alway her heart to grow the more feeble so that in the end i did utter fear to hark and did but set food and drink into me and onward again with an utter fierceness and why there came not any sweet power of goodness to help me in my strait i never to know but did call desperate upon all good things to aid me as i went to save mine own but there naught to come so that i had grown into cursings but that i did not to lose my wisdom to any useless foolishness and alway as i went i to see the land blindly and oft vague and grey as that i did look at naught real and again with strange flashings of light and the glare of fires and anon to see the land as it did be and all odd whiles to have now to me the feel of a dread and monstrous dreaming and surely i sped forever through the dreadful hours and went neither to the right nor to the left neither did i strive to hide in the bushes nor to evade aught for i knew that the maid died slowly in mine arms and there to be no more gain in life save by speed that i have her swift to the mighty pyramid to the care of the doctors and a great and despairing madness grew ever within me and thrice i to have a vague memory that there came creatures at me from the dark of the land but surely i slew them with the diskos and have no remembering thereof only that mine anger did boil in me and i to know once that the diskos did run blood in my hand and lo there to come sudden unto my spirit the knowledge that the aether of the world did be stirred and indeed i did be surely sighted by the great millions of the mighty pyramid and they to have seen me come forward into the sight of the spy glasses and that i did bring a maid in mine arms out of all the night of the world and truly as i did after learn the dear master monstruwacan had discovered me great hours before for there had been a steadfast watch kept in the tower of observation for my returning if that ever i should return and the might of the great spy glass had shown me plain a good while gone and that i did carry somewhat that was surely the maid that i did go to find yet had the master given an order that no word be set abroad to the peoples of this discovering lest that the emotions of the millions to tell overmuch unto the evil powers of the land but now had the millions also come unto knowledge for many had ceased not to watch through their spy glasses and the news to travel very speedy through the cities and surely now there did be a constant spiritual noise in the night to be heard only of the spirit yet to suffice to wake and to warn all that land and truly as i after to learn the master monstruwacan did know by the instruments that there came a force out of the house of silence and this to trouble him greatly so that he set the word through the pyramid by the hour slips that all the peoples strive to contain their emotion lest they bring an harm and a destruction upon me by warning the land with the greatness of their feelings yet in verily this did be useless for the peoples did be very human and could nowise check their gladness and great wonder and excitement for it was to them so great a wonder almost as we should suffer if that a man in this age should go beyond death in search of his beloved and afterward to come backward unto the living and surely in such case how mighty should be our amazement and this to be somewise how they did be yet with it also a sweet and natural gladness and strong welcoming which doth be the true beat of the human heart unto the wanderer and presently and through all the time that i came forward across the land there did be mayhaps an hundred million that did never cease to watch me from the embrasures from the view tables and from all vantages yet for a long while only they which possessed strong spying glasses did be abled to see me truly for i was a great way off and millions did but stare vainly unto that part where i was said to be and the hour slips to come out four times in the hour and to tell aught that did be known and so shall you perceive that humanity did but have grown the more human and in verity i went forward with all my strength and did drive heedless through the miles and the night and scarce conscious of aught because of the aching madness of despair that did grow ever within me for i knew that mine own maid died alway in mine arms as i did carry her and later a monstrous space of hours it to seem i knew that i was come to that part of the road where it did bend somewhat unto the vale of red fire and this did be something anigh to that wilderness where the youths did fight with the giant men and i came over the road and urged my body utter furious across the land and surely in that moment when i cross the road great numbers of the millions did see me that had not seen before and there went a shaking in the aether of the world because of the sudden emotion of so mighty a multitude and lo it did be as that in that moment the land was at last waked for there came from far away unto the eastward a faint and dreadful laughter as that a monstrous being laught unto itself in some lost and dreadful country and the laughter passed over the land and did echo strangely as it did seem in this part and that part and presently to go rolling round in the far and hid west lands and to be as that it wandered awhile amid the far mountains of the outer lands and was presently lost from my hearing and my heart chilled a little maybe but yet did i not care over much for i to lack all if that i lackt death if that i not to be given power to save mine own yet did i make a little pause so that i gat the knife from the belt of the maid and did also to bare the capsule for if that there came a destruction upon us i to make instant sure that mine own maid be safe unto death and i then to go quickly with the capsule and afterward i again upon my way and ever upon each sixth hour i did stop that i eat and drink and did onward again even as a machine for i commanded myself to this duty of victual that i lack not my strength unto the saving of the maid yet truly i did seem to choke alway as i strove with the tablets and lo ever as i went forward did the land awake and my spirit to know that great forces did be abroad restless and the monsters to begin wild roamings because that they also to know of the unrest that did be come into the land and there to go presently odd roarings across the land from night unto night and i to go forward the more desperate and to step neither to the right nor to the left but to make direct unto my mighty home and the vale of red fire did be soon afar off unto my right and the bulk of the watcher of the north east to be somewise unto my left before me and the great back to be toward me and truly i lookt at the brute force and it did be as that i drew nigh unto a mountain of watchfulness and above it in the everlasting night did be the blue shining of the luminous ring and the ring shed a light downward over the monster force and the shoulders did be huge and humpt even as two small hills and it lookt forever from me through eternity unto the pyramid and this to be plain though i did be a great way off from it and sudden as i went there came somewhat out of a bush unto my left and rose up at me very long and tall and surely it did be some kind of a man and came at me and my fury and my despair came inward upon me in a moment so that i troubled not to set down the maid but leaped at the thing where it did be yet half hid in the dark and lo it died in pieces and the diskos did roar to content my heart an instant and i then onward again the more savage so that my heart did be a dreadful thing within me and a great while i went then and do have a vague remembering that this time and that there came things at me from out of the dark but surely they to have died very speedy that i not to remember more and the hours did pass in spaces of time that did be made of terror and numbness and an utter and evergrowing fury of despair and i did be at last as that i did burn inward with a grim and dreadful energy and to seem to grow the less tired and to come over the land with a stronger ease and somewhat as that i did desire things to come unto me that i have something to ease my heart for lo mine own maid did be dying in mine arms as i carried her and i to be in a bleak and sickened dread so that i lacked all courage now to listen unto her heart as i have told and went burning and dry and hot in the eyes and ever there sounded the roarings across the land and there did be added presently lower and more horrid and dread noises and later i heard a far thudding of the earth and in a little there went past me a great man running so heavy that he did make a shaking as he past me yet in verity by a sweet mercy he saw me not and was gone onward in a moment and lost utter into the night and the aether of the world to be full of the trouble of the peoples as the man past me and afterward there to be a stirring of glad thankfulness and truly alway my spirit did know strangely as in a dream that the millions set their sympathy and pity and help about me and did girt me about with human love and with encouragement and with uplifted thoughts yet in verity did all be as water beside the fierce wine of my love and despair which did urge me onward in a natural lacking of all dread save for mine own and truly this doth be the way of love and shall make fearless the heart of the weakest and there to be prayers in the night and all the aether to be surged with the spiritual trouble and callings and cryings of the millions so that indeed if that my spirit so to hear these things it to be conceived that these do pass outward into the everlasting and to break upon the shore of eternity in an anguish even as a visible foam of supplication and surely the unity of love of the millions did make a natural force about me for in verity the force that did come from the house to seem to be somewhat eased from the maid yet there to be no surety in this for all did be desperation and turmoil in my heart and i to have but one thought in my brain that i bring mine own swift across the land unto the mighty pyramid and so unto the doctors and lo there stole presently from afar the deep and dreadful baying of the hounds so that i knew we did be surely dead save that a miracle should happen and i askt in my heart in a fierce and mad fashion why that they did not to rig one of the olden shooting weapons that they shoot from the pyramid and so to give me some aid in mine extremity and behold even as i did be so bitter there went afar upward in the everlasting night where did shine the last light the sharp flashings of the set speech and i did warm in my heart a little with hope for the master monstruwacan did see that i was now all discovered and there to be no more use for silence and did speak straight and helpful unto me and i made to read the set speech but mine eyes had been mad and near blinded with lost hope but in a moment i saw clear and behold the dear master monstruwacan bid me to keep good my courage for that they did have made ready three of the olden weapons and moreover they to save me even if that they have to turn loose the earth current over the land and he commended me with honour and that i strive forward yet a little while for that an hundred thousand men did be prepared and did even then go downward in their armour by the lifts and surely as you shall think my heart eased a little in me and there burned somewhat of a hope in my spirit that i yet to bring mine own unto the doctors ere it be too late and the baying of the hounds did grow nearer in the night and there to grow ever the roarings over the land and a sense of evil and monstrousness to be abroad in all the night and lo i to have come by this so that the watcher of the north east did be backward upon my left and i lookt keen and fearful now at the monster force and behold the great bell ear did quiver continually so that i saw the monster made somewhat known unto all the land and the monster did look as ever unto the pyramid and did be a great and silent hill of life that did lean toward the pyramid and the light from the ring came downward upon the monstrous hide which did be set in vast folds and wrinkles upon it and the monster to know of me yet never to move neither to show life save that the ear did quiver so horridly and i knew that they made some great preparation in the pyramid for our defence for all the night did begin now to shake and to quiver with the mighty beat of the earth current xvi in the country of silence and lo i did be come something nigh unto the mighty pyramid and my great home went up vast into the everlasting night as a very mountain of sweet life and safety and had surely amazed me afresh with the utter bigness of it only that despair and weariness did have too grim an hold upon my heart for me to care of aught save to have mine own maid within the safe wonder of the huge refuge and it did be still afar off from me and i to go forward across the land with a strong going and lo as i past a hollow place where did burn a fire hole there came something out of the hollow and the thing gat upward from crawling and did be a great and haired man and the man lookt at me and afterward came unto me and did put his hands forward very eager as he came and i did see the hands plain in the light from the fire hole and the hands were monstrous and did be armed brutish with horrid claws so that the man should have been able to rip aught even as a wild beast and i put mine own very swift to the earth and surely i cared not for life or aught for this thing did make to delay me and i to be fierce with despair that aught should halt me and lo i leaped very furious and with cold anger at the giant and i smote at the monstrous brute but he unto the side in an instant of time and so escaped the blow and he flung forth his monstrous arm out of the half dark of a shadow that did be cast by the dance of the fire hole and caught my head piece and pluckt it from me so strong and brutish that he cast me nigh a dozen feet on to my back yet i was not harmed in the life but only sore shaked and bruised and i to be up in a moment and came in upon the giant and the diskos did roar and blaze in my hands as i swung the weapon and i gat the giant above the middle part and the diskos did glut itself and went through the giant as that he did be naught though so huge and monstrous and girt with strength and he to have surely turned his shoulders as he died for the upper part of the giant man went horrid to the earth and the legs and the trunk stood plain in the light of the fire hole and the blood went upward as a fountain in the night and i made no pause but leaped unto the maid and had her in a moment to mine arms and onward again past that dead thing that did only then to fall with an horrid sound and surely the night did be full of an astonishment and upliftedness of the millions so that their spiritual cryings did go all about me and did tell me that they had perceived this thing and did cast their love and delight unto me and a vast excitement to be upon them and lo i scarce to have gone a great mile more but there came two vague things out of a dark place where certain rocks did upstand and i smote them with the diskos and went onward but what they did be i never to know and surely after that i did seem to go smiting forever for there to come time and oft strange things out from the bushes and the rocks as that all the land did be a crawl with foul and monstrous life and i to go smiting as in a dream and to speed forward ever with a more fierce despair for surely the end of our lives did be come and i not to be given power to save mine own maid and all the land did be full of grim and monstrous roarings and odd wise lower sounds very deadly and once i did hear the noise of giants running and all the night to be evil and in verity how i did not be slain by some dread force i not to know unless that i did be burned free of all weakness that an evil power should have chance to harm me through for indeed i had been dealt a bitter training a monstrous time and lo there to be again the deep and dreadful baying of the night hounds unto the south east and to be nearer and i to know now that no strength of mine should serve to protect mine own and lo from the upwardness of the night where did be the last light there sudden to come downward a strange blue flash that smote downward into the land unto the south east and again the flash to come and mayhap a score times after and there to come down out of the height a peculiar crackling sound that did be less than the thunder of this age yet more loud than any other sound that you ever to hear and lo i knew that the humans did begin to fight for me that i bring mine own safe unto home and behold it did be as that all the wakefulness of the land that had been did be but as sleep beside the wakefulness that now to come for surely the night now to seem to rock with the roarings of the monsters and with the be stirring of great forces and ever there to go over the land the yowling of that strange and dreadful laughter which did come from that hid country in the night of the lost east and lo there arose constant now the hoarse and dreadful bayings of the hounds and made known that a mighty pack did be out and they to seem to be no more maybe than a good mile unto the south east and i to be all alone save for the dying maid that i held in mine arms and i lookt vainly and with despair for the hundred thousand that did be prepared and had come downward as you do know unto mine aid but truly there did be naught to see anywheres save the strange lights and shadows of the land and the movement of monstrous life in this place and that place and the hounds to come nearer with every moment of time so that indeed i knew that death did be very nigh and i ceased not from my stride but went forward and did begin to run for the pyramid was not a huge way off in the night and the shine of the circle about it to be plain seen save here and there where it did be hid strangely and i to have a despairing hope that i come yet with mine own into the safety of the circle and the baying of the hounds to come ever the more near and surely it did be a doubly hideous bitter thing that i lose my dear one so nigh unto home and the great mountain of my home to go upward before me into the night and to seem so near that surely i did be almost there but yet mayhap two great miles off even then and behold i called out in vain despair and to no end why that none come to give me aid in this extremity for the hounds did bay now but the half of a great mile upon my left and did surely have scent of me by the way of their dreadful baying and truly the millions to have an anguish of sympathy for me for the spiritual noise of their emotion did be plain unto my spirit and they surely to have seen and to have interpreted the way that i did look about me and appear to call out in despair for there came all about me in a moment the companioning of a great and sweet spiritual force which did be bred of their quick going with me in their understanding and love and they to have perceived how that i did be unto the end of hope and the hounds to be almost upon me and in this moment there came afresh to my hearing the shaking beat of the earth current so that i knew the humans to take desperate means to save and there came to my view a vast pack of the hounds unto my left and they came running at a great pace and their heads did be low and they to be so great as horses and seen plain and again in shadow all in the same moment as they did come and in verity i knew that we two to be dead indeed ere a minute be gone if that the humans not to haste and i stood where i did be for there was no more use to run and i lookt from the hounds unto the mighty pyramid and again to the hounds and again i lookt with my hope gone unto the pyramid for the hounds did be scarce two hundred fathoms off from me and there did be hundreds of the mighty beasts and lo even as i lookt that last time unto the pyramid there brake out a monstrous bursting flame that did rush downward from the sealed lower part of the mighty pyramid and the flame smote downward upon the land where the hounds did run and all the night to be lost from my sight in the brightness and strangeness of that mighty flame so that i saw no more the pyramid or aught but only the shining and dreadful glory of that flame and the flame made a blast in the night and a hotness that did seem to wither me even where i did be from it and i perceived that the humans had truly turned loose the earth current upon the hounds that i be saved and there went a constant great thundering over the land because that the earth force did rend and split the air and did tear up the earth and the roaring of the monsters did be husht and lost in that mighty sound and i to see no place where the hounds did be but only flames and broken lands where the earth force did strike and great rocks did be hurled all whithers with a vast noise and truly it did be a mercy that i was not slain an hundred times if this might be by the failings and burstings of great rocks and boulders and lo in a moment the humans did cut off the earth force and had it again to their control and there to seem now a great silence upon the land and an utter dark save that flames and noise came from that part where the current did strike and i very speedy to come free of the dazedness that had me and made again to my running for in truth it to seem now that i should yet be let to win unto safety with mine own and mine eyes did grow presently unto their accustomed using and i to look all ways about me lest there come somewhat upon me even then to work our deaths and for a good time there to be naught that i did see anywheres neither there to be the wakeful sounds of the land save only the grim and horrid laughter from afar in the dead east and oft as i did run i to stare hungry hearted upward at the mighty pyramid and surely it alway now to seem to be less bright than before and in the first i to set this to the count that mine eyes did be yet dazed by the great flame of the earth force but soon i to perceive that it did be otherwise and that there did be truly a less brightness of the light that did shine throughout all the mighty redoubt and this lack i conceived had owing to that great using of the force and power of the earth current that had been loosed to save us and i to have this new thing cold upon my heart for truly if that the force of the current to be made over low there to be a danger for all the humans that did live even for all the great millions of the mighty refuge and this did be surely known by the masters and they to have no more power to aid me with the current until it flow strong again lest that they destroy all the peoples of the earth and all this to be plain to me in a moment as i ran and i to be but the more desperate to come unto instant safety with the maid and surely i to be yet in expecting of the hundred thousand to come unto me but they not to come and all about me the land to begin again to give out the noises of the monsters and to send forth new and peculiar noises as that there did be more awaked in the land than did be ever heard by me before and presently i saw that there went living things creeping between me and the light of the circle and i to know that i yet to have to fight bitter if that i would bring the maid safe and i swung the diskos free and ran on and sudden my spirit to know that i did be warned of some new peril and i to look upward into the night that the master monstruwacan should mayhap to tell me the danger by the set speech but in truth there came not the quick flashings of the set speech but only an upward stillness and a dimness of the lights of the mighty pyramid and afterward i to learn that the dear master monstruwacan made to warn me of danger but that all the instruments of the tower of observation to fail to work and likewise all the machinery of the pyramid to cease even unto the moving of the great lifts and the moan of the air pumps and all to have been this way for nigh a great hour until that the earth current did flow again more full and surely this doth show that death did nigh to come unto all the millions because of the great trial that did be made to save us but truly my spirit did be warned by the trouble of the millions and because the master monstruwacan called vaguely with his brain elements so that i went ever more warily and did look all ways and lo sudden i to stare above me into the night and there to be a pale circle very quiet and steadfast that did go alway over the twain of us and i saw that this did be surely one of those sweet powers of holiness that did stand between our souls and some dread power that came anigh to work our destruction and i to have no over fear but did put my trust in the force of holiness and went forward running warily and surely i came mayhap so nigh as to within four hundred paces of the circle and i to think that i yet to win mine own safe and undelayed within the guarding of the circle and the light of the circle did burn dim so that i had sudden fear whether that it be any more use for a guard until that the earth current to come more free and all this as i ran swift and wary and utter anxious and lo in that moment in a dim place there rose up three beast men from the earth and came at me growling and the first did be so close that i had no room to the diskos but beat in the head of the man with the haft part and i leaped unto the side then and swung the diskos and did be utter mad yet chill with fury so that the maid did be no more than a babe in the crook of mine arm and i came in sudden to meet the two beast men as they ran at me and i cut quick and light with the great weapon and did have that anger upon me which doth make the heart a place of cold and deadly intent so that i had a wondrous and brutal judgement to the slaying and truly i slew them as that they had been no more than mice and i had no harm neither so much as a touch from them and behold in that moment there came a great shout of wonder and of welcome from within the circle and i lookt swiftly and began again to run for there did be men in grey armour all within the circle yet came they not to mine aid and lo in a moment i knew why that the hundred thousand did have held off from me in mine extremity for behold there did be monstrous black mounds all along without of the circle and did rock and sway with a force of strange life that did set an horror into my soul as i ran for truly they did be the visible signs of monstrous forces of evil and did any human have ventured outward beyond the circle then had that man been destroyed in the spirit and lost utterly so that none had dared to come neither had it been of use if any had made themselves to be a sacrifice to aid me for truly they to have been of no use when dead as you shall say and there came a constant shouting from the hundred thousand to me that i haste and indeed to haste and truly i did haste with all my strength and i lookt unto the dear circle of holiness that did be above us twain and it to go steadfast over us so that i saw we to be surely saved and lo i to be no more than an hundred paces now from the glowing of the circle and behold even in that instant there must come brutal things to destroy us for there came an herd of squat and brutish men all about me in a moment from the shadows where they had been hid and they caught at me and caught at the maid to tear her from mine arm and truly it did be as that they surely to have success for i could nowise in a moment free myself and yet to guard the maid and to use the diskos and lo i kickt with my metal boots and gave from them and turned all ways in a moment and wrenched free and i leaped back and the herd of horrid brutes after me and now i to have space for the diskos and a grimness in my heart and i came round very sudden and ran in among the men smiting and i hit very swift both from the right and the left and to and fro with a constant quick circling and the diskos did spin and roar and made a strange light upon the faces of the men and they to have tusks like to the tusks of pigs and surely i did rage through them smiting and they to strike me a thousand times with great stones so that mine armour rang and was all fresh burst and i near to sicken under the blows and new wounds but they not to harm the maid for i carried her above their squat and brutish reach and the brute men to seem without end but i made alway forward unto the glowing of the circle and the night to be full in that place of the fierce shoutings of the hundred thousand and many as i did learn to have tried to come unto me but that their comrades held them from so useless a dying and in verity i to be now scarce fifty paces from the glowing of the circle and did be nigh to fall for i did be so utter dazed and wounded with the fight and ill with a vast weariness and the despair and madness of my journey and moreover as you do know i not to have slept but to have carried the maid forever through days and nights and to have fought oft and lo the hundred thousand stood just within the circle and they that were to the front did swing each man the diskos and they hurled each the diskos in among the herd of the tuskt men that did make to slay me and surely this to save me for the herd did thin to my front and i to gather my strength and to charge with despair and to smite and never be ceased of smiting so that there did be dead creatures all about and behold i brake through the herd with mine own and did be upon the circle and lo i stept over the circle that did scarce now to give out a resistance and a thousand hands did come forward to give me help yet did none touch me but gave back from me for there did be that about me which held them off as with a little awe for i to be strange unto them and i stood there in a great silence and the diskos in my hand ran blood to the haft and maybe i rockt as i stood for many again did put out their hands as to hold me and again drew back and were silent and i lookt unto them and they lookt back at me and i did gasp awhile and was strangely dazed and did try to tell them that i had need of the doctors for the life of mine own maid that did be dying in mine arms and behold in that moment there did be a sound of giants running out in the night and some then to cry out different matters to aid me and to beware of the giants and to bring the doctors to attend me on the instant and other voices did call that the holy light was gone from above and likewise the black mounds from the outer part of the circle and there did be a monstrous noise of roarings in the land and all to come bewildered unto my brain which did surely fail now with the grim and utter stress which had been mine so long and there to be also a constant noise that came from near and from upward and truly i to know as in a dream that it did be made of the shouting of the great millions that did make an eternal and vague roaring sound upward in the night that did come down from the upper heights no more loud than a strange and continual murmuring out of the lofty miles and surely i to find my voice in a little minute and did ask a near man whether there be any doctors with the men and in that moment there came forward a master of the diskos which doth be as a commander of this age and he made the salute of honour with the diskos and would have eased the maid from me but i to ask again very slow whether that there was a doctor a near and he on the instant to give an order and the great thousands to begin to shape and did make a mighty lane unto the great gateway of the mighty pyramid and the master of the diskos made a sign to certain that did be near and they stood about me as i to know dully lest i fall but they not to touch me for i did be as that i must not be laid hand upon for i did near to choke with despair lest i to have come home too late and surely also the men to seem as that i did be strange unto them and there went orders swift and constant this way and that and lo in a little while there came two big men of the upward cities running and they had a little man between them upon a sling and the little man did be a master of the doctors and he aided me gentle to lay mine own maid upon the earth and the master of the diskos made a sign and the men that did be near turned each his back and the doctor to make examination for the life of mine own and there to come about that time a seeming of silence in the land and truly the hundred thousand did be utter quiet and a great quiet in the mighty pyramid for in truth all to know by this that there to be a fear that the maid i did bring out of the night did be slain by the evil forces and sudden the little man that did be the master doctor lookt up quiet and piteous at me so that i knew in a moment that mine own maid did be dead and he to see that i knew and he covered the face of mine own and stood up very speedy and he called softly to the men that did be to my back and he signed to them that some to support me and some to lift mine own maid and bear her unto the great gateway and he lookt keen at me and i to fight a little that i breathe and afterward did make with my hands that the men not to come near me neither to touch mine own and the master doctor to understand that i did be truly strong until i die and did beckon the men from me and from the maid and i stoopt in a little and i lifted mine own maid into mine arms for that last journeying and i came down the mighty lane of the hundred thousand all in their grey armour and they did make silent salute with the diskos reversed each man as i passed him and did be utter silent and i scarce to wot of aught save that all the world did be quiet and emptied and my task to have failed and mine own to lie dead in mine arms yet truly did it to have failed utter for i had surely saved mine own from the terror of the second night land and she not to have come alone and with madness unto her death but to have died in mine arms and she surely to have been comforted within her spirit because that my love did be so utter about her and i to think vaguely and terribly on an hundred sweet love actions that she to have shown unto me and sudden i did remember with a dreadful pain how that i never to have waked to discover mine own maid kissing me in my sleep as i to have meant and a madness of anguish did flash sudden through the numbness upon my brain so that i did be blinded a little and surely went crooked in my walk for i to know sudden that the master doctor steadied mine elbow for a moment but afterward did leave me be as i to have again control of my spirit and lo as i drew nigh unto the great gateway the lights of the pyramid to begin to glow again more strong and the machinery of the lifts and the air pumps to work because that now the earth current did grow once more to natural strength and they to have power now to open the great gate which did be done by great machines and there to come forth to meet me a number of the masters of the mighty pyramid and the dear master monstruwacan did come before them all so eager as that he did be mine own father and he to have heard somewhat vaguely that there to have been a fear for the life of the maid that i did bring and surely he did be told by one near to the gateway that the maid did be dead in mine arms for he and all the masters did pause and stand silent for me to go by and did reverse each his diskos and this to have been an honour shown than which there did be scarce any greater and there went a constant murmuring up in the night which did be the speech of the millions questioning and the news that the maid did be dead went upward through the miles and my spirit to know as in a dream of the spiritual noise which did go outward through all space and did be the grief of the multitudes as they did hear this thing yet truly there did nothing comfort me anywise neither i proper yet to know the verity of my loss for i did go stunned and i came in through the great gateway and the full watch did stand there silent in their armour and they made the salute of honour and i went onward with the dead maid that i did bring out of eternity and presently they that were around did guide me with the maid in mine arms unto the great lift and i took mine own maid into the great lift and the masters came with me and did be in their armour and none did speak to me and the master monstruwacan and the master of the doctors stood silent to the side of me and there did be everywhere great multitudes that i did see vaguely but my spirit not to wot of them and lo i stood very quiet and dumb as we did go upward through the miles and the millions of the cities stood about the great lift and there did be a great silence upward and downward through the strange miles save for the weeping of women in dear sympathy that did sound far and low and constant and presently i to know that the master monstruwacan and the master of the doctors did look one to the other and i to be aware sudden that i stood in my blood for i did be wounded in an hundred parts and the blood to go alway from me yet did the master doctor be slow to do aught for me because that he to perceive that i did be slain in the heart and there to be no pain so dreadful as that he should be like to wake me unto if that he went hastily yet presently there did come whirlings into my head and someone did surely make to ease mine own maid from mine arms but i held her dumbly and the blood to go the more from me and they not to know what should be done and i to look at them and the dear master monstruwacan did be saying somewhat unto me that i did have no power to hear but only to know that his face did be very human and there went a strange noise all about me and the master monstruwacan to seem to hold me up and to beckon to some that did be to my back and lo there came a blackness and the gentleness of arms about mine armour and i to come presently to quietness and to half dreams and did alway to seem that i carried mine own maid in mine arms but truly there did pass three great days whilst that i did be thus and i all that while to be laid quiet and to be tended by the master doctor and aided by all knowledge that did be known of humans and on the third day as it might be called i to come full unto my senses and the pain to take me in the breast and the master of the doctors did be with me and they that nurst me and the master doctor watched me very keen and gentle and i did be in a bed of the health room of mine own city and i gat from the bed and the doctor to say naught but only to watch me and i walkt to and fro a little and he alway to watch me and presently he gave me somewhat to drink and i drank and i was gone soon from all knowledge and i to come again unto a knowing that i yet to live and there went a certain strength in my body and lo the first that i did see was the master of the doctors and i to perceive in a moment that he had wakened me and had nurst my strength for that moment that i live through the burial for he to be very wise and to have known from that first seeing of me that i not to live after that mine own did die and there was brought to me a loose garment but i to refuse the garment dumbly and did look about me very troubled and forgetting and the master doctor lookt alway at me and lo in a moment he called one and gave an order and there was brought in then my broken armour and a garment to wear below and i then to know that i did be content in this matter and the doctor alway to watch me and they drest me in my broken armour and surely as they drest me my spirit to hear the sorrow and sympathy of the multitudes and did know that they went downward by millions unto the country of silence and lo in that moment when i near to be in mine armour i to mind sudden again that i never to have waked to discover mine own maid kissing me in my sleep and the pain gat me in the breast so that i had surely ended then but that the master doctor set somewhat to my breath that eased me and gave something of dullness unto my senses for a while and i did be carried then in a sling unto the great lift and there did be a bed in the lift and the doctor to have me to lie upon the bed and i to know that he also to know that i never to need a bed any more neither should i ever to come upward again in the lift and truly the mighty pyramid did be an emptyness for there did seem to be left only the stress masters that did arrange the moving of the millions and the stress masters did stand about the lift as we dropt downward through the great miles unto the underground fields and we came downward in the last unto the country of silence which did lie an hundred miles deep in the world and did be an hundred miles every way of silence unto the dead and they that were with me gat me from the lift and did mean to carry me in the sling unto the last road but i stood upon my feet and made that i should walk and i held out my hand for the diskos which one did carry and the master doctor signed that they should obey me as my spirit to know and i walkt very steadfast down the way that did lead unto the last road and the master doctor walkt behind me a little space off and surely there did be all the peoples of the world in that great country and the peoples did be spread out forever so far as my seeing did go and they to have sight of me and all the aether did be stirred with the humanness of their sorrow and their kind sympathy and there grew a murmur which did be like to a low rolling thunder and did be the voices of the peoples and the rolling of that great husht sound went to and fro across that mighty country of quiet and there to be afterward an utter silence and i saw below me the place of the last rest where did be the beginning of the last road and there did lie there a little figure covered with a white robe that did glimmer with the beauteous work of women that had stitcht love and honour into that last garment and surely i to rock upon my feet and to steady myself with the diskos and the master doctor to be unto my side in a moment and gave me again something that i breathe in but indeed i to refuse after that i had taken one breath of the drug for i to be able to bear my pain the little time that i now to have to live and i to mean that i have no dimness of my senses for those short minutes that i should have yet near unto mine own and truly the master doctor did not press me anywise but had a perfect understanding and went quiet again to the rearward and i came soon to that place where mine own dead one did lie and the master monstruwacan stood to her feet and did be clothed in grey armour and had the diskos reversed and this to be for an honour unto my dead maid and there kneeled two maids in white one to the right and one to the left of mine own and they to be for faithfulness and did be maids because that they watched by a maid and had likewise been matrons if that the dead had been wife unto any and the place at the head of the last rest did be empty and did be for me and he that stood to the head did be for love for it did be the chief and did hold dominion over and did make to live both faithfulness and honour and this to be the way of the burial alway and lo i took my courage into my heart and i stood to the head of mine own maid and i lookt down upon the wondrous white glory of the garment which did be white because that mine own did be a maid yet did be worked with yellow flowers of weeping as we did call them because that she had died in love and i to know that no hand had toucht that wonderful garment save the hands of maidens and behold as i stood there from far away over the land there did come a far and faint sound and the sound did come more nigh so that i knew that afar off beyond the hills of the babes the millions did begin to sing the calling song where million did call husht unto million and the sound did come onward toward where we did be and did go over us and pass onward in a husht and wondrous breathing of sound as that all the love that did be ever in this world did call in a low anguish unto a lost beloved and the sound to pass away and away over that mighty country in the deep earth and did hush and hush unto a great and utter silence save for a faint murmur of countless women weeping that did be in the air of that land of quiet and there to be a space of silence and again the silence to be broken by a far sound and there to come again from beyond the far hills of the babes a strange and low sound and did be as of a wind wandering through damp forests and the sound grew and came across the hills of the babes and did be breathed forth by million after million so that in a little i to hear the song of weeping sung very low and sorrowful by the multitudes and the song came onward over all that great country and past over us and went onward into the far land beyond the dome and did be caught by the voices of millions that did be hid in great distances and so to go onward forever and to die at last unto a mighty silence and the master monstruwacan lookt at me from the feet of mine own maid and i to know that the moment did be come when i to part from the maid naani forever and forever even though i to live in some strange future and to find her soul in some other sweet child and i stoopt and laid the diskos beside mine own maid there upon the last rest and the two maids drew back the light wonder of the garment and showed me the face of mine own and she to sleep there forever so sweet and husht as a child and as oft i to have seen her to sleep and i lookt a little while and the pain of my heart did be sufficient so that i knew i died as i lookt and once more i lookt and i set my soul about mine own and i fought with myself and stood upward and the maids did cover the face of mine own maid and the master monstruwacan commended naani unto eternity and he raised the diskos reversed and lo the road did begin to move upward unto the dome and mine own maid did be upon the road and i to fight that i keep breathing so that i not to die before she be lost utter to my sight and there did rise now a sound from all that country that had no order in it and did be like to a low moaning that did fill all the air of the land and there to be also a constant sound as of a little whistling dree wind that did be in all that country of quiet and truly this to be more than any singing for it to be the true weeping of multitudes that did sorrow from the heart with the grief of this thing that did be and i stood utter still and did draw my breath very even and lookt unto that small form that did be now afar off where it did lie upon the moving roadway and i gazed as that my soul and all my being did have no power else even as a man that dies doth set all his strength to a last movement and i not to wot that the master monstruwacan and the two maids did hold me up because they to perceive that i did be dying for i only to see mine own little one lying afar off upon the moving of the last road and the maid in that moment to come to the place where the road did pass into the strange and luminous vapour of the earth current which did lie all about the base of the dome and the vapour to be only as a faint shining smoke scarce seen yet to be enough to give something of uncertainty to the dead when that they did have past inward of it and i stared with all that did be left of my strength for mine own to be gone utter and forever in but a little minute and the uncertainty of the luminous vapour did cling about her and to make her to seem unreal to my gaze for the vapour did be in constant movement and to give a seeming of shifting to and fro of all that did be in it and behold as i did stare with my dreadful pain there did be sudden a strange hoarse noise from the nearer millions and lo in an instant there came a mighty shout out of all that country and the shout did be made again and did grow into a mighty hoarse roaring from the millions so that all that great country did be filled with the monstrous sound and in verity i to have seen the thing likewise but to have set it to the madness of longing of my heart and to that desperate and dreadful pain which did make me to be crazed and lost from all sane thinking and the thing that i did see had been that the maid did seem to move there upon the last road where she did lie but indeed this to have appeared only to be the stirring of the luminous vapour of the earth current which did seem to make things shift as i have told and lo i now to see truly that the maid did move where she was laid afar off upon the road and i now to know and to believe that she did indeed live and my life came into me with a bounding yet did my heart seem to be a moment stilled in my breast and the master monstruwacan to have signed already that the roadway be stopt and brought backward but i to be now upon the last road and did run as a madman shouting vainly upon the name of mine own and i to learn afterward that there to have been a dreadful peril that all the near millions to rush toward the last road and so mayhap to have caused the death of many and to have been like to have crusht mine own but this danger to have been eased because that the watch master did act very prompt and set the great regiments of his men to keep back the millions and did send a signal abroad over all the country that there to be calmness for that the maid should be succoured and alway whilst this to be i did run staggering most strangely upward of the last road and surely that great roof did ring and boom with the constant and mighty shoutings of the millions and there did run others also along the road to my back but i to have been the first and to make a good speed though i did stagger and rock so strange upon my feet and the road alway to be moving backward under me and so i to be come wonderful soon unto where the maid did be and she to be upon her back and to have pusht the garment from her face and did be lying with her eyes open and a look of gentle wonderment upon her dear face and she then to see me and her eyes did smile at me very glad and quiet for there to be yet an utter weakness upon her and lo i came with a falling beside her and i gat upon my knees and upon my hands and my heart did shake my lips to dry whisperings and she to look weak and steadfast unto me and i to look forever at her and i did alway try to say things unto her but my mouth to refuse me and understanding did come into her as a light and she to know in that instant that she to be truly come into the mighty pyramid and i to have gat her there somewise and she to wake sudden in her body and set her hands forth all a trembling from the garment and in dreadful trouble and i to see then that the blood did go from me constant and the maid to have perceived this thing so that she was waked the more proper in a moment from her death swoon and surely i did bleed very dreadful for all my wounds did be opened with my running and i to have sudden power with my lips and did say unto her very simple that i loved her and she to be all in an haze from me and i to know that she to have come likewise unto her knees and did have my head upon her breast and there to be an utter shaking of the air with some great sound and a mighty spiritual stirring of the aether of the world and there to be then the voice of the master monstruwacan very dull in mine ears and the low voice of the master doctor but i never to hear what they did be saying and did know only that mine own maid did live and i not to mean to die but to fight unto living and even whilst that i made this resolving i was gone into an utter blackness xvii the love days now when that i gat back unto life i to know that i went upward in the lift and did be upon that same bed where i to think i never to need a bed any more neither to come upward again from out of the country of silence and i to know vague and strange that there rose up from out of the mighty depths of the world the deep thunder of the underground organs and did sound as that they made a strange and utter distant music beyond death and there to go alway a rolling chaunting as that multitudes did sing beyond far mountains and the sound to be somewhiles as a far blowing wind low in the deep and again to come clear and to be that great olden melody of the song of honour and i knew as in a dream that the millions in that deep country made an honour and a rejoicing over this wonder of joy which did be come but yet all to be faint and half hid from me and mine eyes to be as that they had no power to open and i to seem to be lifting alway upon strange waters of unrealness and there to be sweet and lovely odours and these to be of reality and to come from the great fields where the flowers did alway to grow about the passage ways of the lifts for the lift even then to be going upward through the great miles and mayhap i moved a little for there came the voice of the master doctor low and gentle to me and bid me rest for that all did be well with the maid and surely afterward i did be gone into an haze and there to be then a seeming of days in which i half to live and half to sleep and to wonder without trouble whether i did be dead and then there to come days when i lay very quiet and had no thought of aught and the master doctor oft to bend over me in this hour and that hour and to look keen into my face and in the end after strange spaces there bent over me another and there lookt down upon me the dear and lovely face of mine own and the eyes did speak love into my soul yet did she be calm and husht and i to begin again to live in my body and i made mayhap a little fumbling with my hands for she to take and to hold them and life to come from her to me and she to be ever wordless and gentle and contentment to grow in me and presently a natural slumber and there came a day when i did be let rise and they that tended me carried me to one of the quiet gardens of the pyramid and they set me there and did seem to leave me alone and there came one then around a bush and lookt at me a moment as with an half shyness only that the love that did shine in her eyes made the shyness to be a little thing and truly i knew that it did be mine own maid but i never before to have seen naani drest pretty as a maid and i lookt to her and knew that she did be more dainty than even i to have known and sudden i made that i rise to come unto her but she to run quick to me that she stop me of this natural foolishness and she then to sit beside me and to take my head against her breast and she not to deny me her lips but to be both a maid and a mother to me in the same moment and afterward she had me to be very still and we to sit there in an utter dumb happiness until they that did attend me were come again and the master of the doctors did be with them and i to see that there went something of satisfaction in his face and after that day i saw mine own maid every day and i gat better unto health with a wondrous quickness for love did mend me and soon i did be let go downward unto the fields but yet to go by private ways because that the multitudes should be like to follow me alway and i to need to be quiet and the maid to be with me for the master monstruwacan and the master of the doctors did agree upon this matter and had an officer of marriage to wed us and we to be married very quiet and simple for i yet to be over weak for the public marriage which we to have later when truly the millions made us a guard of honour eight miles high from the top unto the bottom of the mighty pyramid but this to have been later as i do tell and did be a ceremonial of the peoples because that they not to be denied that they give me an honour and surely the maid to be with me alway and did be now my wife and my strength to come alway upon me and mine own to grow again unto a perfect health and in verity we did be now in the love days which do be the most beauteous if that the love to be true and we did wander through the mighty fields at our will and walkt in the love paths of the fields which did be alway anear to those places where did be the villages and i to hide our name lest we to be beset by any out of natural curiousness and kindliness for we to need to be utter together and quiet and we to chose those places for our slumber where beauty of flowers did be most wondrous and we to carry somewhat of food with us but also to eat when we came unto the villages which did be here and there in the fields which were truly so huge as countries and mine own did make good her promise an hundred times as you shall say and did prepare me a great and hearty meal and did tease me utter that i did be a glutton as i did eat and kist me lest that i have ever a chance to say aught in mine own defence and truly she did be all that my heart and my spirit did desire and she to have companioned me with love and to have entered my spirit into joy and once we to go downward unto the country of silence but not to stay very long at that time because that my memory did return upon me yet in the after time we to wander there oft with memory and holiness of great thinkings and with love which doth hold all and as we to leave that country i to tell mine own how that when she had been suspend of her life by the horrid force of the house i to have minded me with a dreadful pain that i never to have waked to discover her kissing me when that i did sleep and surely mine own dear one did blush most lovely and had never known that i did be aware of her sweet naughtiness and she then to have all thought for mine agony when that she did be dead ere the vapour of life of the earth force did set her spirit free of the silence and she to come unto me in dear understanding and she then to tell me that the doctors to say that she had been as it were stunned and froze of the spirit and all her being and life suspend and the great life force of the earth current to have waked her spirit and her body then to live and her blood to flow proper again and the doctors had talkt much and searched much of late in the olden records of their work and they to have found somewhat of one such happening in the olden time but truly naught such to have been ever through a mighty age of years and whilst that we to wander and to rest in the fields i oft to tell mine own of this matter and that matter and i to know that she had learned somewhat of odd things ere i did be come to health but not overmuch for she also to have been utter alack as you shall think and to have come from her bed when that i did lie so still for the master doctor to have ordained this because he to fear that i to be going truly to die if that he not to do somewhat to awaken my spirit and in verity you shall think upon the deepness of my love as i to know that she did have held my hands so brave and gentle whilst that she to have scarce power to her feet and i to say a little holy praise of mine own and so do i come to mine ending and have but one more thing that i tell and this to happen a while later after that mine own and i had gone through the second marriage which did be the public marriage for it did be that one day my wife that did be mine own did take me with a sweet cunning unto the hall of honour and surely when i was come there i to see that many of the peoples did be in that great hall and did stand about in a silence yet as that they had no meaning to do aught but yet to be that they did wait upon somewhat and my wife did go forward with me unto the centre place of the hall and sudden i saw why that she did bring me so cunning sweet for there did stand in the midst of the hall of honour in the place of honour a statue of a man in broken armour that did carry a maid forever and i did be dumb and how of this age shall you to know the honour that this to mean in that for it did be an honour that was given only to the great dead and i to be but a young man and did be so utter far off from greatness save that i to love with all my heart and with all my spirit and therefore death to be but a little thing before love and you to know how love doth make sweet and brave the heart and to have understanding with me in my humbleness and my wonder and my natural pride that there did any so think to honour me and mine own did be weeping with joy and honest pride of her man beside me and there to be an utter silence of dear sympathy in all the great hall of honour and they that did be there to let me go in quietness with mine own which did be a lovely thing of understanding and i to go loving and thoughtful with mine own wife and she to be very nigh to me and i to have gained honour yet to have learned that honour doth be but as the ash of life if that you not to have love and i to have love and to have love is to have all for that which doth be truly love doth mother honour and faithfulness and they
